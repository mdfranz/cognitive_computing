"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs there are now ""four confirmed deaths"" connected to the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in the UK A patient in their 70s has become the fourth person to die from coronavirus in the UK. The pensioner, who had underlying health conditions, appeared to have contracted the disease in the UK and was being treated at the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs there are now ""four confirmed  deaths"" connected to the coronavirus outbreak in the UK. Mr Hancock, responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, told MPs: ""Here in the UK, as of this morning, there were 319 confirmed cases. ""Very sadly this now includes four confirmed deaths. ""I entirely understand why people are worried and concerned and we send our condolences to the families."" Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England said: ""I am very sorry to report that a fourth patient in England who tested positive for COVID-19 has sadly died. ""I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their privacy is respected. ""The patient, who was being treated at the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital, was in their seventies and had underlying health conditions. It appears the virus was acquired in the UK and full contact tracing has begun.” Mr Hancock said the NHS is well prepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. He said: ""We continue to work to contain the virus, but we're also taking action to delay its impact, to fund research and to mitigate its consequences. ""Throughout our approach is guided by the science. That is the bedrock on which we base all our decisions. ""Our plan sets out what we are prepared to do and we'll make the right choices of which action to pursue at the right moment. ""The scientific advice is clear - acting too early creates its own risks, so we will do what is right to keep people safe. ""Guided by the science we'll act at the right time and we'll be clear and open about our actions and the reasons for them."" He added that the NHS has received a spike in calls through the 111 number. The Health Secretary said: ""We've now added an extra 700 people to support that effort. 111 online is now dealing with more inquiries than the voice calls."" He said 'the time taken to test is being reduced as we're bringing in a new system for faster results'. Mr Hancock told MPs: ""We will shortly bring forward legislative options to help people and services to tackle this outbreak. ""The Bill will be temporary and proportionate with measures that last only as long as necessary in line with clinical advice."" Mr Hancock added that the Government would stop at nothing to get its response right. The Health Secretary reassured the House of Commons that food supplies would continue even in a 'reasonable worst-case scenario'. Conservative former health secretary Jeremy Hunt asked Mr Hancock to reflect on what the UK has learnt from the coronavirus outbreak in China ""given that yesterday was the first day when reported new cases in the UK exceeded reported new cases in China""",real
"EXCLUSIVE: Poplar and Limehouse in east London is just a few minutes walk away from Canary Wharf - one the biggest financial districts in the world - yet more than half of the children there are living in poverty It's just minutes away from one the biggest financial districts in the world yet it has the highest level of child poverty in the country. Poplar and Limehouse in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets is a modern day ""tale of two cities"". Punitive welfare policies, low wages and soaring housing costs have pushed more and more families below the breadline. Since the Tories came to power in 2010 child poverty in the UK has soared by more half a million from 3.6 million to 4.1 million. According to figures complied by charity End Child Poverty, the constituency tops the shameful league table with a concerning 58.5% of youngsters living in poverty once housing costs are included. Are you a parent struggling with poverty? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk Yet because of its location next to Canary Wharf, home to high-earning bankers and other workers in the financial industry, the true deprivation and social economic woes can be skewed by figures such as the average wage in the borough. Our Give Me Five campaign wants an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lift 200,000 children out of destitution. We also want the Government to restore child tax credits, to scrap the two-child limit and to axe the benefit cap. Mirror Online reporter Lorraine King visited Poplar and Limehouse to find out why it is Britain's child poverty capital. Poplar and Limehouse is also in the midst of gentrification which has resulted in a huge gulf between the rich and poor. There are multi-million pound homes saddled next to social housing. Surging house prices and rents in the capital means it is becoming more popular with high-earning bankers and financial workers who want a quick commute to Canary wharf. This means that poor families have less of a choice when it comes to which houses they can afford to rent. James King is a councillor for Poplar and Limehouse and says housing is one of the biggest issues surrounding child poverty. He told Mirror Online: ""There is a crisis going on with child poverty. I've been involved with politics for 10 years now and I have seen how the area has changed through gentrification but the child poverty remains the same. ""Child poverty has been an issue in Tower Hamlets as a borough for a very long time. ""We have some of the richest people in London living next door to some of the poorest. ""Housing in the private sector here is becoming more and more unaffordable but people still need to live around here because it's their community - their jobs are here, their families are here. ""But because housing is so unaffordable people are living in overcrowded conditions and that leads together issues such as damp that causes health issues."" Juli is a married mum-of-five who has lived in east London for most of her life until her private landlord doubled her rent and she found herself homeless. * Read more about our Give Me Five campaign She sought help from the council who moved her out of the borough to an address 20 miles away in Enfield. The 50-year-old couldn't afford the train fares to take her two youngest children to school she was forced to rely solely on buses. She said: ""This meant getting up at 4am to make sure we got to school before 9am. But sometimes the journey was too long for my youngest daughter and she would end up wetting herself as we never passed any toilets on the way. ""It was horrible but we had no choice I couldn't afford to get a train so I started bringing a change of clothes for when she did have a accident."" According to the council, there are more than 20,000 households on their housing list but they grant just 1,800 tenancies a year. Dad-of-two Abdul Hamid is on the housing list but in the meantime he is being forced to rent a one-bedroom flat privately for £1,400 a month. He said: ""Because I'm renting privately and not homeless my family is not a priority. I have been bidding for lots of homes but nothing so far. ""Rent privately is what has pushed my family into poverty."" Since 2010, Tower Hamlets Council has been forced to make £190m cuts to cope with a financial blackhole caused by a decrease in government funding. Figures by the National Education Union also shows that schools in the borough have lost a whooping £110million of funding since 2015 - the equivalent of £725 per pupil. Paul Garayo, is the chief executive of Limehouse-based arts and community charity Stitches in Time, which teaches women in the area valuable dressmaking skills to help them crawl out of poverty. He said: ""Government cuts are forcing people to turn to charities like Stitches in Time. ""There's a lot of provision that the local government miss out and people fall through the cracks. We provide a safe space so people can florish. We allow people to realise their aspirations and build up skills that can help them find employment."" Local councillor James King said: ""The council has felt increasing challenges when it comes to funding because most of their funding comes from the Government. ""We have to make a couple million of cuts every single year. We try and protect the services that help the most vulnerable like children's social care. ""We want the government to give more power to the local authorities this will allow us to let people have more say about their own lives. It's unfair that the government has a say on whether councils can run properly or not. ""It should be fairer than that."" The Government's controversial benefits system has been blamed on plunging more families into poverty. Research by the council into Universal Credit found that so many residents were struggling to make ends meet that they set up a £6.6miliion poverty fund to help plug the gap. Out of the funds, £1m was ring-fenced for the most vulnerable families facing waits of up to five week for any money as they switched to Universal Credit. Tower Hamlets Mayor John Biggs said: ""Universal Credit has made serious problems for families. “We were one of the first boroughs to be fully transitioned onto Universal Credit so we are well aware that its introduction has presented serious challenges for our residents."" Deputy Mayor Rachael Blake is also the borough's cabinet member tasked with tackling poverty. She told Mirror Online that Universal Credit has been identified as one of the biggest causes of poverty in the borough. ""It is driving people into further poverty and debt and the housing costs. ""This is why we set up the poverty fund so we can help the most vulnerable people and support them as much as we can. Some people are unaware that they are entitled to other benefits so we have an outreach team to make sure they care claiming everything they are entitled to."" Tower Hamlets has the largest Bangladeshi population in the county. The 2011 Census showed the Bengali community made up 32 per cent of people living in the borough. This is compared to the community making up three per cent of the population in London and just one per cent in England. In 2015 a report called 'Ethnic Inequalities' by the Centre for Social Investigation (CSI)  claimed that British Bangladeshis are around three times more likely to be in poverty compared to their white counterparts. It also claimed people from the Bengali community were more likely to be lower-skilled in living in overcrowded conditions which fuels poverty. Teenager Thamima lives in Limehouse with her Bengali parents and three siblings. The family-of-six have lived in a two-bedroom council flat since Thamima, 17, was six months-old. She said: ""This has always been an area with a lot of Bengali people who are poor area even though it's becoming gentrified. ""We've been on the waiting list for a bigger house for seven years and it hasn't worked out. It's a similar situation for lots of families here who have been on the list for years and years because there is such a shortage of housing. ""A lot of Bengali parents aren't confident with the English language so may miss out on claiming benefits they are entitled to. ""I know some children have to sit down and fill out forms for their parents or even claim Universal Credit for them"".",real

"Vet Janey Lowes had a glam WAG life with her professional rugby player boyfriend in Newcastle until she went to save street dogs in Sri Lanka and win at Animal Heroes My life five years ago is unrecognisable from the one I lead now. Back then, I was a vet working with small animals in my native Newcastle, and living with my professional rugby player boyfriend, Alex. At 25, I had the career of my dreams, a nice house, a nice car, and no money worries. Life was good. I have wanted to be a vet ever since I was a little girl, one of five kids growing up in Barnard Castle, County Durham. My dad’s family were farmers and I was surrounded by animals, although my first true love was Finn, a brown and white spaniel, who was an abandoned puppy I adopted when I was doing work experience at a vet aged 16. Finn slept in my bed and I adored him. It was Finn who ignited my strong connection with dogs. After qualifying from Nottingham University, I relocated back up north for work and moved in with Alex. We’d been together since I was 14, he was my soul mate and best friend rolled into one. But things started to go downhill when we lived together. On the outside, we had everything, a seemingly enviable and glamorous lifestyle. But I’d come home tired and stressed, and he’d be exhausted from playing rugby full time. It was like the fun was over and we needed to shake things up. We booked a trip to Sri Lanka in May 2014. The holiday was supposed to repair our relationship, but we ended up splitting up at the airport before we even got there! We still went as friends, though, and the country blew me away. The beaches, sunshine, friendly locals and surfing were heavenly. The only problem for me – and it was a huge problem – was the street dogs. They were everywhere! The healthy ones seemed happy enough roaming the streets, but all too often they were mange-ridden or injured. Their soulful eyes followed me as if asking for help. One dog that particularly got to me I called Tom. He was so friendly and trusting. He had a nasty gash under his eye, which would have been simply treated in the UK with a few stitches. I knew that in a tropical climate it would soon be infested with maggots. I didn’t have any of my veterinary kit with me, but I couldn’t leave him like that, so I decided I’d pay for a Sri Lankan vet to treat him. I asked several, but despite me offering to pay, none would agree to treat a street dog, because they weren’t viewed as worthy, which shocked me and I didn’t know what to do. Back home, I couldn’t get poor Tom out of my mind. I started Googling Sri Lankan charities that helped street dogs – my worry was those that I could find had been set up by well-meaning individuals as opposed to vets. I wasn’t sure their ethics and way of working would align with mine. I was desperate to make a real difference. With Alex and I now split, it would have been easy to move out and carry on with my nice comfortable life, but I realised there was nothing tying me down now. Why not go to Sri Lanka and start treating these animals? I had some savings, I thought I could survive for a year, help some dogs, and then come home. So I spoke to my wonderful manager at the surgery, Nick, about my plan. He was so supportive and even gave £10,000 from the company to help me get started. What a boss! Online, I found a woman called Otara Gunewardene, who’d set up an organisation called Embark, based in the capital Colombo, which helped street dogs. She explained the most useful thing a vet could do was neutering and vaccination, which made total sense to me and I decided to make those the focus of my charity, which I called WECare Worldwide. I tied up the loose ends of my life, sold my car and booked my flight for October 2014. Along with my clothes, I packed surgical kits, bandaging and Manuka honey, which can help with wound management. My family came to wave me off at the airport, and I was excited rather than daunted. Landing in Colombo, in the heat and with the tuk tuks and bustle was a thrill, but I headed straight for Talalla, a beautiful beach town in the south where I’d met Tom, the dog with the poorly eye whose photo I had kept with me to remember my mission. I stayed at a surfing retreat initially, where I’d previously made friends from my holiday with Alex. One of the first dogs I treated was Joy, who had been bitten by another dog and whose wound was crawling with maggots. I tweezed them all out, cleaned her up, and bandaged her. No one had ever seen a bandaged dog before! It was a drop in the ocean, but I felt so happy to have achieved something when she went back onto the street, now wagging her tail. Making the charity a success became my focus. As well as treating the dogs, I taught myself how to build a website, how to fundraise, generate publicity, and all the other things you never think about. I also learned how to speak Sinhalese, and soon understood when locals called me a crazy white dog lady! I worked and worked. I went from having one tuk tuk driver to now employing 17 members of staff, including five vets, three nurses and several trainees. In the blink of an eye I’d been in the country a year, then two – and now over five years have passed. Sri Lanka is my home. Since my first patient, maggoty Joy, we have helped around 12,000 street dogs – from puppies bitten by poisonous snakes, to dogs who have eaten food laced with explosives. I’ve had to amputate mutts’ legs who’ve been run over, and treat STDs, yes, dogs get them too. I am frequently bitten by dogs, including some with rabies, so I’ve needed jabs that have sometimes made me sick. I’ve contracted mange, as well as ringworm, which isn’t nice. I’ve suffered abuse from locals who think I am mad. But it’s all been worth it. Twice a year I come back to the UK for fundraising, and I’ll go to the dentist, hairdresser and get my legs waxed at the same time. My priorities have changed. I haven’t used a hair dryer or worn make-up during the day for years. I eat fish, rice, and veggies, but I miss proper chocolate, Wotsits, and cheese, which you can’t get here. Surfing is my therapy, I try to go every day. In 2018 I was thrilled to win Vet of the Year. I came back to Britain for Amanda Holden to present me with a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Award. Alesha Dixon and Laura Whitmore were lovely. Then last year, I featured on C5’s Ben Fogle’s Lives In The Wild. His dad is a vet and Ben was so supportive and kind. My life now is a far cry from the one I had in Newcastle. I live in a simple beach bungalow, with a lean-to kitchen, camping hob and sadly, rats. One room has air conditioning, but it’s expensive to use and I try and live frugally. I have adopted five dogs – I couldn’t resist! – called Mali, Benji, Stitch, Lottie, and Tilly. But I’ve had to toughen up, or I would have taken them all in. I am ready to meet someone now, but I’m not desperate to have kids, I’ve got the dogs. There are enough people on the planet, but I would consider adoption. I’d like to expand our charity across Sri Lanka and open clinics in other parts of Asia. People have described me as selfless, but I love what I do and get to spend time with animals every day. I get as much back from these dogs as I give them, I feel so lucky. – Janey The Vet by Janey Lowes is out on 19 March (£14.99, Michael O’Mara) available to pre-order now.

"Bob Weighton, from Alton, Hants, says he's lived 'long enough' but is worried about his relatives contracting Covid-19 and has taken to washing his hands more frequently after the outbreak  The world's oldest man today admitted he's 'worried' about the coronavirus - but insists it's not as bad as the 1918 Spanish flu.  Bob Weighton, 111, from Alton, Hants, says he's lived 'long enough' but is worried about his relatives contracting Covid-19. Mr Weighton has been taking greater care with cleanliness and hygiene since the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. He's taken to washing his hands more frequently and using a nailbrush to scrub under his nails. But Mr Weighton, who remembers the Spanish flu outbreak after World War I, maintained that Covid-19 is less fearsome. Mr Weighton, who still lives on his own in a flat in Alton, was born on March 29 in 1908 and has lived through the Spanish flu, both World Wars, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union and the invention of the internet. But despite having seen off so many dangers, he admitted the rapid spread of coronavirus concerns him. He said: ""I'm very worried about coronavirus - everyone should be. ""I should be worried about myself but I've lived long enough. But I'm more worried for my children and grandchildren. ""I'm washing my hands more and using a nailbrush to clean my nails properly. I'm being much more cautious."" More than 100 years ago, Mr Weighton saw the spread of the Spanish flu, a pandemic which started in 1918 after soldiers fighting in World War One returned home and brought the disease with them. Between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide are thought to have died. Speaking of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,500 people globally, Mr Weighton said: ""The numbers of people dying in China is scary. ""But in Europe and elsewhere, the numbers are still not reaching the millions that died of the Spanish flu. ""I hope they never do. But you never know how bad the coronavirus will get. You just have to do the best you can and not worry."" He added: ""I was only ten at the time of the Spanish flu. ""I remember hearing stories going round and reading newspaper articles - as I am doing now with the coverage of coronavirus - about people getting the Spanish flu and dying. But luckily I never got it."" Mr Weighton said he has been lucky to avoid truly serious illnesses during his time. ""I've never been at a point of dying off,"" he added. ""But I did have a growth on my stomach which could have been serious. I had to have an operation which has left me with only half of my stomach left. That was about 30 years ago."" Mr Weighton was born in Hull, East Yorkshire, and was the middle child of his three brothers and three sisters. He had three children of his own, has 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. He remembers the outbreak of the first world war and as a teenager he trained in marine engineering. But by the time he qualified in 1925 the shipping industry was in decline and so he headed to Taiwan, where he worked as an English teacher and also met his future wife Agnes. On the eve of World War II in 1939, Bob and his family attempted to return to the UK by boat, but after arriving in Canada they were informed the war had begun and they were stuck there. After the attack on Pearl Harbour while Mr Weighton was living in Denver, USA, his knowledge of the Japanese language meant he was recruited by the British Political Warfare Mission. He deciphered enemy messages and also worked to disrupt the morale of the Japanese to try and help the Americans win their fight. After the war, he was finally able to return to England with his wife and three children and spent the rest of his working life as a lecturer in marine engineering at City University in London, until his retirement, aged 65, in 1973. He and his wife, who passed away in 1997, spent much of their retirement volunteering as marriage councillors and helping at youth groups in Alton. Mr Weighton has lived through the reign of five monarchs and seen 26 Prime Ministers come and go from 10 Downing Street. Remarkably, he had shared the title of Britain's oldest man with Alf Smith, of Perthshire, as the pair were born on the same day, but Mr Smith died last year. He became the world's oldest man two weeks ago following the death of Chitetsu Watanabe, from Japan, at the age of 112.",real
"Spring 2020 looks set to an exciting season for TV viewers, with dramatic new shows such as Honour, Quiz, Four Lives and The Undoing You know what they say... when life gives you a global killer virus and crazy weather, best to stay indoors and watch telly. Fortunately there’s plenty to get excited about, with TV drama at an all-time high as broadcasters battle to be the best on the box.  Hit shows are set to return this spring, including series six of BBC1’s Line of Duty , a fourth run of C4’s The Handmaid’s Tale, a second outing for Ricky Gervais’s Netflix comedy After Life and a third season for BBC’s mega hit Killing Eve .  But here’s our round-up of the brand new shows coming soon to the small screen that you definitely won’t want to miss… Keeley Hawes stars in this two-parter as the real life detective who hunted down the killers of 20-year-old Banaz Mahmod.  The young Londoner was strangled to death and buried in a suitcase in a so-called honour killing in 2006. Banaz had fled an abusive arranged marriage and fallen in love with a new man, which her family said brought shame on the family. Honour tells how Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode’s passionate search brought the murderers to justice. Keeley says: “In a time where honour killings are still rife, it is critical to shine a light on such an important subject.”  In a departure from comedy, Stephen Merchant plays a creepy serial killer in this thriller about the real life Barking Murders.  He plays murderer and rapist Stephen Port, who killed four men, hunting out his prey on dating app Grindr between 2014 and 2015. Sheridan Smith plays Sarah Sak, the mum of murdered 23-year-old Anthony Walgate.  The series aims to tell the story of the murders from the point of view of the victims’ families and their fight to uncover the truth amid a highly-criticised police investigation. “It’s a story that can’t be ignored,” says Stephen.  With a blonde wig and fake tan, Michael Sheen has transformed himself to play quiz host Chris Tarrant in this drama about the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? cheating scandal.  In 2001, Major Charles Ingram, his wife Diana and accomplice Tecwen Whittock, who was sitting in the audience, duped the show by setting up a coughing code in order to win the top prize. The audacious heist, which saw the three stand trial, is told in three parts and also stars Sian Clifford, Mark Bonnar, Helen McCrory and Aisling Bea.  Line of Duty’s Martin Compston and Peaky Blinders’ Sophie Rundle join forces for this thriller, meaning it’s bound to be an absolute belter.  They play well-off couple Dan and Emily, living in Glasgow, who are desperate to have a baby but have had no success despite trying for years. When they meet down-on-her-luck teenager Kaya (Mirren Mack), they make a surrogacy pact with her that will change all their lives forever. It feels like the three were meant to meet, but was it really by chance? And will everyone get their happy ending? It doesn’t sound likely… Mel and Sue playing contract assassins is the killer comedy duo we never knew we needed. Sue Perkins plays Fran, while Mel Giedroyc plays Jamie - two best mates who just happen to kill people for a living. Having stumbled into the career, the hapless pair are not your typical murderers. Working out of their scruffy van, each hit is derailed by bickering and general incompetence. And as the body count stacks up, their friendship is put through the wringer. Expect brilliant disguises, plenty of banter and a lot of death. Laugh out loud funny, this comedy about parenting and its many pitfalls stars Martin Freeman and Daisy Haggard. They play couple Paul and Ally, who meet, fall in love and everything is going swimmingly - until they have kids. “Who is happy with two kids under seven?” asks Ally. As they juggle careers, a mortgage, kids and troublesome parents, the sitcom also looks at that parenting paradox… Paul explains: “I would die for those kids, but often, I also want to kill them.” This semi-autobiographical comedy from young Canadian star Mae Martin follows her as a recovering addict and comedian. Life is further complicated by a new and all-consuming relationship with her new girlfriend George, played by Call The Midwife actress Charlotte Ritchie. Then add into the mix Mae’s mother, played by Friends legend Lisa Kudrow. And watch out for Sophie Thompson as another recovering addict. “It’s sweet and very funny and awkward and well observed,” says Kudrow.  A stellar Hollywood cast, including Nicole Kidman , Hugh Grant , Edgar Ramirez and Donald Sutherland , take on this gripping miniseries from the creators of Big Little Lies and the producer of The Night Manager.  Kidman plays Grace Fraser, a successful therapist on the brink of publishing her first book, who has a devoted husband (Grant) and a son at an elite New York school. But a violent death, a missing husband and a whole heap of shocking and terrible revelations all leads to a very public disaster. A psychological thriller that’s set to get everyone talking.  From comedy film titans Greg Daniels and Steve Carrell , the guys who brought The Office to America, comes this hilarious new workplace sitcom.   Carrell stars alongside John Malkovich as part of a new Space Force.  The premise is that the government has announced this new, sixth branch of the United States armed services. It’s mission? “To defend satellites from attack and to perform other space-related tasks. Or something.” What could possibly go wrong? A 19th century tale of adventure and mystery, this is an epic story of love, murder and revenge based on Eleanor Catton’s award-winning novel. Set on the Wild West Coast of New Zealand’s South Island in the boom years of the 1860s gold rush, it tells the story of men and women who travelled across the world to make their fortunes.  Bond girl Eva Green stars as a calculating brothel madam, along with Eve Hewson and Himesh Patel as star-crossed lovers.  Tom Hollander and Saskia Reeves star in this heartbreaking and humorous story of a relationship on the brink, adapted from David Nicholls’ hit novel.  Douglas Petersen (Hollander) is blindsided when his wife Connie (Reeves) says she’s not sure she wants to be married to him anymore. Agreeing to still go on their planned family grand tour of Europe, Douglas vows to win back her love and repair his relationship with their son Albie (Tom Taylor). It’s a journey through some beautiful cities and some troubled souls. When emergency services received a call from concerned people in Salisbury in March, 2018, worried about an old man and a young woman ill on a bench, it kickstarted an extraordinary chain of events. The Russian double agent and his daughter had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, targeted by Russian nationals. Anne-Marie Duff , Rafe Spall and Mark Addy lead the cast in the drama which focuses on the impact on the local community, as Salisbury became the unlikely focus of a national emergency.  Julie Graham and Neil Morrissey lead the cast in this three-parter that explores forbidden love, betrayal and grief. They play married couple Rosalie and Luke, who along with teenage daughter Maddie, go to bereavement counselling when their son dies. Once there, their lives are changed yet again when they mean Jed, a beautiful, charismatic young man who eventually moves in on their lives. A lover to Maddie, a surrogate son to Rosalie, it all seems hopeful, but a morally corrupt nightmare is taking shape and it’s not going to end well.  With The X Factor firmly at death’s door, it’s down to global superstars Little Mix to step into the shoes of Simon Cowell.  They are on the search for talented singers to become members of all-female, all-male or mixed bands in this brand new entertainment show. The hit makers, aka Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, will create the bands and become mentors as the new bands live together and battle for the prize to join Little Mix on tour.

"The world's biggest dog show returns to Birmingham's NEC on March 5 so we look back at some of our favourite funny moments Crufts, the world's biggest dog show, is back and thousands of pooches are competing to be crowned the winner. But the stars of the show turn out to be the most unlikely candidates. Over the years these lovable dogs have won hearts because of their hilarious efforts in the ring. From hiding in the tunnels and refusing to jump over hurdles, to simply refusing to do the course, these dogs are the clowns of Crufts who make it so memorable. Here we look at some of the funniest fails... Gentle giant Kratu stole everyone's hearts in the Rescue Dog Agility round in 2018. The Romanian rescue dog started off well enough, flinging himself at a hurdle, but he was easily distracted.  Kratu flew through the tunnel, but decided to take a well-earned rest inside before he bounded off again in all directions.  His spectacular performance went viral and he returned by popular demand last year.  The Jack Russell was so excited to get going on the course, he slid into the first hurdle and fell over in 2017. But like any great champion, Olly dusted himself off and got straight back up again.  Making a strong come back, he zoomed around the course, jumping off the hurdles and flying through the tunnel. About half way through though, he got a little lost and had a sniff of the corner of the ring.  Lucas the Saluki was only interested in one thing in 2014 - sprinting to his heart's content.  Having the time of his life, he ignored most of the hurdles and had no time for the tunnel. Instead he bounded around happily, just like a dog should.  The little Papillon gets top marks for loyalty to her owner as she didn't want to leave her side in 2018. After multiple attempts to get Tinklebury to have a go at the course, all she wanted to do was play with her owner. Her owner even tried to pick her up and position her right in front of a hurdle but Tinklebury was having none of it.  With a helping hand though, they eventually managed to get her over one hurdle.  This cross-breed's hopes of glory went down the pan when she just couldn't hold it in on the agility course in 2012.  Libby was doing well at first but with only the slalom poles to tackle, she was disqualified. Despite making the wrong kind of impression on the judges, a commentator quipped: ""A dog's got to do what a dog's got to do. What a shame."" ""Oh dear, disqualified. What was the reason for the disqualification? Pooing on the course, now that's not very nice is it?""",real
"Love is Blind couples were treated to the ultimate romantic getaway at Mexican hotel Grand Velas Riviera Maya and it's so luxurious Netflix 's Love is Blind has had us glued to our screens from the moments where the couples met in the pods, got engaged... and all of the drama that ensued before their big days.  Then of course there are have been all of the romantic settings from their cosy pods to the lavish resort where they got to know each other before meeting the families and planning their weddings. The pods themselves were custom-built at Pinewood Atlanta Studios so you won't be able to visit them, but the good news is that you can recreate the couples' luxury holidays in Mexico.  That's because the trip didn't take place on a set - instead, they jet-setted off to the luxurious Mexican resort Grand Velas Riviera Maya , near the bustling Playa del Carmen.  When we say luxurious, we mean it. For a start, a stay in one of the resort's Grand Class suites are 1,377 sq. foot and offer up incredible oceanfront views. Then there's the king-size bed with plush linens, a huge marble bath with a Jacuzzi tub, a rain shower and even space for a massage table should you want some in-room pampering. Other highlights include a private terrace with a plunge pool - which proved popular with the couples during their stay, as it led to many romantic moments. They won't have needed to lift a finger, with suites boasting a pillow menu, daily turndown service, a walk-in closet to store their clothes, a lounge area with a sofa for relaxing, and heaps more perks. Of course the couples did manage to tear themselves away from their suites to enjoy some quality time by the pool - and they had three pools to choose from. (One of the pools was the unfortunate setting for the showdown between Diamond and Carlton). If the pool doesn't appeal, then the resort also offers a beach, where we saw Amber and Barnett enjoy a picnic date. For couples after some quality time together, there's plenty of opportunity to make memories; guests have access to a jam-packed activities programme including snorkeling, kayaking, boogie boards, yoga and pilates, not to mention the countless excursions that can be organised. Guests who take a leaf out of Gigi and Damian's book and opt for spa treatments will have a plethora of choice thanks to the extensive treatment menu on offer - and while they opted for outdoor massages, the resort's spa does have an indoor section complete with its hydrotherapy pools. When it came to dinner dates, the couples had a choice of the resort's five signature restaurants spanning everything from gourmet Mexican dishes to classic French cuisine and even Mediterranean inspired offerings. Or, like the couples, suite guests can opt for in-room dining if they're looking to make the most of their private terraces.  Feeling inspired to have your own romantic break? The hotel has launched a Love is Blind themed package which includes heaps of the perks and luxury experiences which the couples got to enjoy during their stay. ",real
"The actor, 52, is returning as James Bond for a fifth time in No Time To Die, but he's admitted that the five-year wait for the movie was partly caused by his anxiety over the role Daniel Craig says that the five-year wait for new James Bond film No Time To Die was partly caused by him suffering from anxiety and feeling ""physically really low"".  The actor, who is returning for his fifth outing as 007, has admitted struggling with the physicality required for preparing for the role. He had said his last Bond flick Spectre would be his final time playing the secret agent, before later changing his mind. The 52-year-old also said the demanding role has left him suffering from anxiety.  He told GQ magazine: ""I was never going to do one again.  ""I was like, 'Is this work really genuinely worth this, to go through this, this whole thing?' And I didn't feel... I felt physically really low. ""So the prospect of doing another movie was just, like, off the cards. ""And that's why it has been five years."" His last turn as Bond was in 2015's Spectre, which at the time was reported to be his final outing as the spy. Daniel said that the ""physicality"" of Bond is ""a preparation, in a way"", because he would not get the script beforehand. ""It's making my head go, 'This is what it's going to be',"" he added. Trying to prepare for a role in one of the most popular film franchises in modern cinema without a script also caused him to have anxiety. He said: ""I have suffered from it in the past. ""I have suffered because it's been like, 'I can't cope. I can't deal with this'."" The British actor has also told of his regret over not speaking up about the script for the previous four Bond films in which he has starred. ""I've kept my mouth shut before and I've stayed out of it and I've respected it and I've regretted that I did,"" he told the magazine. Looking ahead to life after Bond, Daniel, who is married to actress Rachel Weisz, said that his future may involve ""having another kid, maybe just being older"".  He said: ""But all of these things, I was just like, you know, f**k  it. There are other things that are more important.""  On future acting roles, he added: ""I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. ""Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f**king good fist of it.""  The star said that No Time To Die, which was recently pushed back to be released in November instead of April amid global concern around the spread of coronavirus, will have references to Donald Trump .  ""We struggled to keep Trump out of this film, but of course it is there,"" Daniel said.  ""It's always there, whether it's Trump, or whether it's Brexit , or whether it's Russian influence on elections or whatever...  ""There are British people working in the top industries in the world and at the top of those industries. ""We do that, and we are good at that. And somehow we're kind of breaking all that apart. Whether that's breaking from Europe... There is a sort of a nihilism, isn't there?"" The film finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA - played by Jeffrey Wright - turns up asking for help. A mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading to a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. No Time To Die also stars Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas and is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, with a script co-written by Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It will be released in UK cinemas on November 12. * Daniel Craig stars in the April issue of British GQ in a global GQ James Bond exclusive.

"Six years ago today, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared without a trace - the wreckage of the plane has never been found and there has been no resolution for the families of all 239 on board On March 8, 2014, the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. It should have landed in Beijing, China, later that day but instead disappeared less than an hour after take-off. The wreckage of the Boeing 777 has never been found, nor have any trace of the passengers and cabin crew on board. Debris began to wash up on beaches across the Indian Ocean more than three years after the plane vanished. Heartbreakingly, the search for the missing jet was called off in 2018 - but there are still no answers as to what actually happened to Flight MH370. Conspiracy theories surrounding the plane circulated almost as soon as it went missing. Did the pilot deliberately change the course in a gruesome murder suicide or was the plane hijacked? Were its controls remotely hacked and was it landed safely outside of the radar that should have been tracking it. MH370 set off in a normal take-off from Kuala Lumpur but 38 minutes into the flight it made its final communication with air traffic control. It disappeared from conventional radar minutes later but was tracked by military systems for another hour, where it seemed to be deviating from its planned flight path. Journalist Ean Higgins author of The Hunt For MH370 believes he knows exactly what happened to the jet. Amateur detective Mick Gilbert came up with the theory, although there is no concrete evidence that this is what happened. He claims there was a devastating blaze in the plane's cockpit around 40 minutes into the flight when the windshield heater on the pilot's side caught fire. Ean says this could have burned out some circuits, including the secondary radar transponder and the communication systems. Pilots are trained for emergencies just like this and would have simply put on their oxygen masks and cut the power to the heater. But Ean claims this led to a catastrophic chain of events that caused the deaths of everyone on board. By cutting power, the crew would also have switched off the satellite data unit, which meant they were no longer linked to satellites. Ean then believes the First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, will have been the one in charge of the plane while Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah dealt with the blaze. As soon as the fire was under control the captain and first officer would have made a distress call. Emergency training for pilots stresses that making sure the plane remains airborne and finding a course for the nearest airport are the two initial priorities in an in-flight emergency. The third is to radio for help and to let air traffic control know what is happening, which means the plane could have changed route without anyone on the ground being aware. However, Ean believes that during the crisis, one of the oxygen masks the two pilots were wearing was yanked out of its socket. The cockpit would then have been filled with the contents of the oxygen bottle, which is a highly flammable gas, and could easily cause an explosion. Captain Zaharie was already on his feet and trying to deal with the flames - but First Officer Fariq would have been incinerated as he tried to control the plane. An explosion of this size would have weakened the windshield of the aircraft, which would in turn have caused a rapid decompression. In these situations, oxygen masks would fall from the overhead compartments, giving passengers 12 minutes of air in the out of control plane. Ean then says Captain Zaharie could have fled the cockpit to reach an oxygen mask before he fell unconscious before making his way back into the front of the plane. With the communication equipment destroyed in the explosion, the captain then had a truly horrifying decision to make. He had just minutes of oxygen left and many of the passengers were dead or already in comas as their air supply ran out. Captain Zaharie could either try to crash land over Penang, a heavily built up area, and possibly save himself and the flight attendant who had helped him back into the cockpit but at huge risk to the thousands of people on the ground. Or he could divert the aircraft over the Southern Indian Ocean and crash land in the sea. It would mean everyone on board would perish but would save the lives of the innocent people on the land below. While many have doubted this theory, one key element does give it some credibility. When Captain Zaharie re-entered the cockpit it would have automatically switched the satellite communications system back on. Mystery has surrounded why it was switched off and then back on again.",real
"Manchester United were counting down the days until Paul Pogba returned from injury, but since Bruno Fernandes signed in January, the Red Devils have a new focus  Paul Pogba is going to have to fight for his place at Manchester United when he returns from injury, because it doesn't feel like he's needed anymore.  That's the opinion of Paul Ince, who thinks Bruno Fernandes has stolen the Red Devils midfielder's thunder since signing in January. United were counting down the days until Pogba returned to the first team prior to the club splashing out on the Portugal international.  But since Fernandes first pulled on the United jersey, the Old Trafford club have been rejuvenated, and are brushing teams aside including Chelsea,Manchester City,Watford and Club Brugge.   Last time out Fernandes inspired United to victory over Manchester City at Old Trafford.  Ince is no longer convinced the Red Devils need Pogba as a result, and believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may look to leave the midfielder out when he finally returns from injury.  ""Fans thought Paul Pogba was going to be the star. But, look how that panned out,"" Ince told Paddy Power News. ""If he still wants to leave I'd say it would be far easier for Ole to do so now that Bruno is around. It doesn't feel like they need him anymore. ""His truly great games have been few and far between, so the current situation could suit club and player. ""If he does come back before the end of the season, he's not even going to get in the team. He's going to have to fight for his place – if he even gets one.""   * For more from Paddy Power's columnists, visit: news.paddypower.com  ",real

"Deliveries from big chains like Tesco, Sainsbury's and ASDA could be made early in the morning or late at night if people are forced to order in while they're under COVID-19 self-isolation Time restrictions on getting a home delivery from your supermarket could be axed to help retail giants meet a huge surge in demand from the coronavirus. Supermarket bosses held crisis talks this evening with Environment Secretary George Eustice on how to help vulnerable people get home deliveries - if they are forced to self-isolate due to COVID-19 Customers have reported week-long delays for delivery slots as panic-buyers strip products like toilet paper and hand soap from shelves, despite government warnings not to.  Those deliveries are partly hemmed in by complex restrictions on when firms can turn up at your door - including in ""anti-social"" hours like the early morning or late at night. Now the government would widen the ability to make deliveries using a seldom-used power under the 1998 Competition Act. The Act bans supermarkets from ""abusing their position"" by working together over how they sell goods. But the government can suspend these rules if there is an ""exception and compelling reason"" - a power used four times in the last two decades, including in the 2012 fuel crisis. It is understood the possibility of triggering this exception for a fifth time was to be discussed in the conference call between supermarket giants and Mr Eustice this evening. A government source said: ""One of the issues which we are looking at very keenly is this idea of lifting restrictions on when supermarket home deliveries can take place, to give them greater flexibility."" Shoppers concerned about having to self-isolate amid the spread of coronavirus in the UK have sparked Christmas-level demand for some items. Tesco has limited the sale of goods such as pasta and long-life milk, while a number of major stores are joining them in restricting sales of hygiene products such as hand sanitiser. But shoppers have been assured there is ""no need"" to stockpile and warned against doing so, after images emerged of empty shelves in stores in some areas of the country. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said today's meeting would look at “support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation."" He insisted the UK “continues to have a resilient supply chain” and the government will ensure that “continues to be the case”, with no need to panic-buy key goods. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs food supplies will continue even in the ""reasonable worst-case"" scenario. Speaking in the Commons, he said: ""We are confident that food supply will continue even in our reasonable worst-case scenario. ""We have been talking to the supermarkets for some time about this scenario."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the Government is in ""constant contact"" with major retailers to ensure supplies are available and that shelves are restocked as necessary. He told BBC Breakfast: ""There is absolutely no need for anybody to stockpile or anything like that. ""We are confident that the supermarkets have the supply chains necessary to keep shelves stocked for people, so there really is no need for that (bulk-buying) to happen."" An industry source said the empty shelves are not reflective of any issues in supply chains. ""The only thing that's stopping shelves remaining stocked as normal is people buying more than they need,"" the source said. ""There is absolutely enough for people to get the normal amount.""",real
"Dancing on Ice host Phillip Schofield asked runner-up Perri Kiely an awkward question after Joe Swash's surprise victory Joe Swash was the surprise Dancing on Ice 2020 champion - but many viewers are claiming it was the wrong decision. Cheeky chappy Joe and pro partner Alex Murphy were crowned winners in a shock result that few saw coming. The couple saw off tough competition from Perri Kiely and Vanessa Bauer during an incredibly tight public vote. All three finalists received perfect scores of 40 for all of their dances with nothing to split them on the night, but Perri had the stand out performance wit his death-defying backflip. After announcing that Joe was the winner, Phillip told runner-up Perri that everyone thought he ""had it in the bag"". In response to the awkward remark, Perri said: ""I gave everything I wanted to. ""Joe has come so far. I've made a friend for life with Joe, he's like my brother."" The two men then embraced during an emotional moment before Joe and Alex lifted the trophy as Perri and Vanessa watched on. Some Dancing on Ice viewers were unhappy with the final result and took to Twitter to complain. One viewer said: ""The viewers has ripped off Perri, he should've won, considering he was more skillful in skating, consistent & talented than Joe. ""My instincts told me that this would happen. I am disappointed, cuz I definitely don't think Joe deserved to win, I'm being honest wid u."" ""How in the actual F**K did Perri & Vanessa not win #DancingOnIce?! They were robbed! ""Oh yes I know... we’re in Britain where (outside of London) most people are inherently racist / it was a fix,"" added another. A third agreed: ""I'm sorry that the british public let you down @perrikiely you deserved to win. ""Joe Swash has done well and improved alot and deserved to be in the final. ""But Perri did a motherf*ckin BACKFLIP on the ice. Everything Perri did was what you wanted from a champion."" ""What the f*** happened? No way should Joe be crowned the winner!? ""Yes he was good but Perri should have won! He was robbed,"" said a fourth. Gobsmacked Joe nearly collapsed in surprise while his proud son Harry and girlfriend Stacey Solomon applauded alongside baby Rex. On how it felt to win, Joe said: ""Honestly, amazing. It is the most amazing experience. To share with Al."" Phillip claimed Joe was the most improved skater ""without question"" before Holly handed over the trophy. Many Dancing on Ice fans took to Twitter to praise Joe after he lifted the trophy with partner Alex. One viewer said: ""Well happy well done @realjoeswash you was the most improved and deserved to win #DancingOnIce"" ""Congratulations Joe. Brilliant win, very well deserved. Definitely most improved over the series,"" added another. A third said: ""All you ever need to know about Joe Swash...He put in blood,sweat and tears to win dancing on ice and then stood aside so his professional partner could lift the trophy"" ""A well deserved win for Joe, so happy for him. Its all about his journey, no dance experience for him,"" said a fourth. Perri risked serious injury during the live final by completing a death-defying backflip. No one has ever attempted the dangerous move on the show before, let alone when the stakes were at their highest. Even Perri seemed stunned that he had pulled off the sensational backflip as he wobbled but remained on his feet and hugged the pro skaters. Close friend Ashley Banjo jumped up on his seat and admitted he was ""lost for words"" and shaking. *Dancing on Ice airs Sundays on ITV at 6pm",real
"That depends. If you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an “official” seller, you are entitled to a refund, often automatically. For example, those who bought tour packages to go to the Italy v England Six Nations rugby match in Rome on 14 March – which has been postponed – will be offered a full refund or tickets for the new date. Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said: “Fans worried about being left out of pocket as a result of these games being postponed should be entitled to a refund on their match ticket if they cannot make the new date. Unfortunately it will be harder to get a refund on any travel or accommodation booked for the match, unless these were purchased as part of a package deal.” Keep a close eye on venue and ticket agency websites, especially before you set off – most are providing regular updates. If you opt not to go, there are a number of fan-to-fan resale websites, including Twickets, where you can sell your tickets and hopefully recoup your outlay. Also bear in mind that if you have purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the site’s (typically restrictive) terms and conditions. This is a tricky area and you may be fighting your case with large numbers of other people, but as a last resort you could turn to your credit or debit card provider to seek a section 75 claim or chargeback. Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, your credit card company is jointly and severally liable for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the retailer or trader. This right is useful if the retailer or trader has gone bust, or doesn’t respond to your pressure, although the transaction must be over £100. Similarly, if you paid by debit card then you can seek a debit card chargeback. You can’t apply for either if you paid by Bacs or direct bank transfer, however. The British Retail Consortium says shops have so far seen no effect on the numbers of customers entering stores, because coronavirus cases are still low and contained. But at the same time demand for home deliveries appears to be soaring. Last week, the delivery giant Ocado advised customers to place their orders early, due to “exceptionally high demand”. It said: “More people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders. As a result, delivery slots are selling out quicker than expected.” Generally, shoppers are being advised to book a weekday delivery instead of a weekend one. “We’re unusually busy Friday to Saturday at the moment,” Ocado said. In reality, delivery slots are not disappearing that quickly. The government has told supermarkets to ensure they make provision for home delivery to vulnerable people in self-isolation, given that the government is advising people who have returned from badly affected coronavirus areas to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. There could be disruption further down the line if illness affects delivery drivers and other staff, but retailers have pledged to manage this as best they can. It’s always sensible to have a well-stocked freezer – but this has gone much further, with supermarket shelves now being regularly emptied of basics such as toilet roll, hand sanitiser, tinned tomatoes and pasta due to panic-buying. It’s definitely best not to stockpile, as this will heap pressure onto the retail supply chain and deprive others such as the sick and the elderly whose need may be greater than yours. Panic-buying can also drive up prices. Some sellers on Amazon and eBay have already tried to cash in on coronavirus fears, with prices for hand sanitisers at 10 times usual rates. The situation relating to Italy is changing fast, but the travel trade association Abta warned on Monday that UK holidaymakers who had booked summer trips to the country faced losing money if they wanted to cancel now because of the coronavirus. It said people who had paid for package holidays not due to begin in the next few days would need to wait to see if the situation changed. On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FCO) updated its stance to advise against all but essential travel to parts of northern Italy, including Venice, Milan and Parma. Anyone imminently due to visit the locations named by the FCO on a package holiday should be offered alternative arrangements by their travel provider and a full refund if there are no suitable options. If a tour operator refuses, customers may be entitled to compensation under the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements 2018 regulations. But Abta said it was too early to say that summer holidays could not go ahead as planned. “If you cancel early you may have to pay cancellation charges,” it added.",real

"Russia has been accused of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to help advance its criminal interests and to “go after” Vladimir Putin’s enemies in London, MPs who drew up the Russia report suppressed by Boris Johnson were told. In secret evidence submitted to parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC), the campaigner and financier Bill Browder claimed Moscow had been able to “infiltrate” UK society by using well-paid British intermediaries. Some had “reason to know exactly what they are doing and for whom”, Browder told the committee. Others “work unwittingly for Russian state interests”, he said. The alleged intermediaries include politicians from both Labour and the Conservative parties, former intelligence officers and diplomats, and leading public relations firms. Collectively, they form what Browder calls a “western buffer network”. There is no suggestion in Browder’s testimony that British citizens broke the law. The regime in Moscow uses these professionals to mask its “entangled” state and criminal interests, he alleged. It deploys them to attack Putin critics, “enhance Russian propaganda and disinformation” and to “facilitate and conceal massive money-laundering operations”, he said.  Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Browder’s claims false and “totally groundless”. Questions about corruption at the heart of the Russian state were “a perfect example of a maniac-style Russophobia”, Peskov said. With his permission, the Guardian is publishing Browder’s previously confidential evidence to the ISC. The committee carried out a two-year investigation behind closed doors into how the Kremlin is seeking to influence and subvert UK politics and society. Its 50-page report was ready for release last November, before the election. The prime minister was accused of refusing to publish it. Downing Street cleared the document after the election. It claims the final document contains little new information and is underwhelming – although others who have read it disagree. Opposition MPs said Browder’s evidence demonstrated the need to publish the report as soon as possible. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, wrote to Johnson a month ago asking for a timetable for the report’s publication, which requires Downing Street to appoint a new nine-member cross-party committee of MPs and peers. But nearly three months after the election, that process is only in its early stages, and it is likely to be a few weeks at least before the long-awaited report is able to be issued, partly because new members need to be vetted before they can sit. Browder was one of several expert witnesses invited to give evidence to MPs and peers. In September 2018 he submitted a 14-page statement, which included a number of recommendations. They include setting up a US-style register of individuals working for foreign state interests, as well as extra resources for regulators, investigators, police and prosecutors. He calls on Companies House in London to review filings made by firms linked to Russian money-laundering scandals. Speaking to the Guardian, Browder said: “Yes, there are members of the Russian security services working out of the Russian embassy under diplomatic cover. What the government seems to be missing is the fact that there are all sorts of informal espionage networks. “There are Russian oligarchs who have a much greater impact on the security of this country. What’s most shocking is that the Russian government is indirectly hiring British nationals to assist them in its intelligence operations.” Browder argues that the Russian state and organised crime have in effect merged. Money stolen from the budget and private companies is used to enrich senior officials – including Putin – and to finance “black ops and special projects”, he told the ISC. The Kremlin has issued multiple Interpol warrants for Browder’s arrest and says he is a criminal. It has convicted him in absentia of tax evasion and deliberate bankruptcy. Browder says he is the victim of a vendetta by corrupt state officials. He denies all charges. Browder’s fund, Hermitage Capital Management, was once the biggest foreign investor in the Russian market. He fell out with the authorities after – he says – calling for a clean-up of companies in which Putin and his inner circle have financial interests. In 2005 Russia deported him from Moscow. Officials linked to the FSB spy agency subsequently stole $230m in taxes paid by the fund to the Russian treasury, Browder alleges. In 2009 his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in custody. Browder persuaded the US and some other western governments to sanction senior officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses. The Kremlin was furious. It paid British firms to “advance a false narrative of the fraud”, Browder told the ISC. One official allegedly involved, Andrey Pavlov, made an unsuccessful attempt to keep his name off a European parliament sanctions list, hiring the Labour former attorney general Lord Goldsmith to lobby on his behalf. Goldsmith’s law firm received a £75,000 fee, Browder claims. The firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, said it could not comment on confidential client matters but that Pavlov denied wrongdoing. It added: “Everyone is entitled to legal representation. Debevoise provides legal representation consistent with the profession’s best traditions of integrity and probity. We will continue fearlessly to defend the interests of all our clients.” Pavlov retained the services of GPW, a business intelligence company run by a former MI6 officer, Andrew Fulton. Browder says GPW’s brief included gathering intelligence on him. Fulton – a chairman of the Scottish Conservative party – left GPW in 2017. Its managing director, Philip Worman, said he could not comment on “any aspect of our work”. Fulton’s former GPW colleague Andrew Wordsworth said Pavlov was entitled to know the facts of his case: “The use of sanctions against individuals is a pretty draconian remedy. Some people would argue that before you destroy people’s lives they should be able to defend themselves.” In his evidence Browder alleges that Pavlov also hired Lynton Crosby’s communications firm CTF, paying it £45,000. However, CTF denies Browder’s allegations. It says Goldsmith’s law firm hired a separate entity, CTF Corporate & Financial Communications (CTFCFC), to “research the EU sanctions landscape”. CTFCFC advised the law firm and there was no contact with Pavlov. “This was the extent of our involvement and to try and claim otherwise would be utterly false,” it said. According to Companies House records, Crosby is a CTFCFC director. There is no suggestion Crosby personally worked on or was aware of the work on EU sanctions carried out by CTFCFC until it appeared in the media. “Lynton Crosby was working exclusively on the 2015 general election campaign for the Conservative party at this time, and had no client involvement, outside of the Conservative party,” it said, adding that Crosby had never met or worked with Goldsmith or Debevoise. Browder further names British individuals who have fronted up offshore companies used in the alleged Magnitsky fraud and in other cases. The UK citizens appear as nominal directors of non-transparent firms in countries through which billions of dollars have been laundered, including the UK, Russia, Ukraine, Cyprus and Latvia.",real
"Alex Salmond believed three of the women who accuse him of sexual assault and intent to rape had consented to sexual contact, the jury at his trial has heard. The former first minister, 65, from Strichen, Aberdeenshire, has appeared at the high court in Edinburgh accused of sexually assaulting 10 women over a seven-year period between 2008 and 2014 and has denied all the charges. The 15 jurors, made up of nine women and six men, were told the former Scottish National party leader had been charged with one count of attempted rape, one of intent to rape, 10 of sexual assault – some of which allegedly occurred numerous times – and two of indecent assault. The jury was told Salmond believed three of the women consented to sexual contact in four of the alleged assaults, including a charge of intent to rape. In relation to one of the charges, the jury heard Salmond had an alibi because he denies being at the location where he was alleged to have sexually assaulted one woman. Lady Dorrian, the trial judge and lord justice clerk, Scotland’s second most senior judge, told members of the jury they should consider withdrawing if they had very strong positive or negative views about Salmond that would prevent them being impartial. “As you will realise, the accused is a very well known public figure and the case has attracted a great deal of publicity. It follows that the injunction, indeed the requirement, is that any verdict must be in accordance with the evidence in this case is of particular significance,” Dorrian said. Nine of the charges relate to a number of alleged assaults on eight women at Bute House, the official residence for Scotland’s first minister in Edinburgh’s Georgian new town, including the attempted rape and intent to rape. One of the alleged offences is said to have taken place at Bute House eight days before the 2014 independence referendum. The attempted rape charge accuses Salmond, who was first minister between 2007 and 2014, of allegedly blocking the path of a woman in a bedroom at Bute House, removing her clothing and his clothes, touching her breasts and pushing her on to a bed where it is alleged that he tried to rape her in June 2013. In the intent to rape charge alleged to have taken place in December 2013, he is accused of lying on top of a woman on a bed at Bute House, touching her breasts and bottom, and pulling up her dress with the intention of raping her. The other charges involve alleged assaults at various locations including in Baillieston, Glasgow, in 2008; a nightclub in central Edinburgh in 2010 or 2011; a car travelling from Holyrood Road to Waverley station in Edinburgh in 2011; at the Scottish parliament at various times between 2011 and 2013; at Stirling Castle in November 2014; and the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant in the west end of Glasgow in 2012. With the exception of the two indecent assault charges, 12 of the charges are offences under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 and carry a potential sentence of life imprisonment and fines.",real
"Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for 15 minutes on Monday because stocks tumbled so drastically in the first few minutes as a result of global coronavirus panic and an oil price war sparked by Saudi Arabia. The Dow opened on a loss of more than 1700 points on Monday, adecrease of more than seven percent since Friday's close, after a chaotic weekend which saw oil prices tumble and which all but decimated the futures market. Circuit breakers - which are rarely triggered but exist to stop prices tumbling further when a downward spiral shows no sign of slowing - went into effect on Monday morning after a dramatic start. After a 15 minute break, the stock exchanged re-opened but it had slipped further, losing 2,000 points in total.If prices drop to 13 percent from Friday's close, trading will stop for another 15 minutes. Then, it will take for them to drop by 20 percent to stop for another 15 minutes. Monday's opening marked the worst start on Wall Street since the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 which triggered the GFC. Oil prices are at their lowest since the Gulf War thanks to a fallout between Russia and Saudi Arabia which may trigger an all-out price war that could harm the world's economy even more. Last week, Russia refused to agree to the terms of a deal that would slash the world's oil production rates. In retaliation, Saudi Arabia vowed to boost production and slash prices, a move which threatens to saturate the world's market with cheap oil as demand for it plummets thanks to the virus. Scroll down for video It exasperated the problem and now, has created an even bigger one. 'Crude has become a bigger problem for markets than the coronavirus. 'It will be virtually impossible for the [S&P 500] to sustainably bounce if Brent continues to crater, he added,'Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said Sunday. As on Monday morning; Despite the financial chaos, President Trump tweeted about that it was 'fake news' and that Democrats were to blame for mass hysteria. 'The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant,' he tweeted. 'Great job being done by the Vice Presidentand the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you! 'The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world! 'So much FAKE NEWS!,' he said in others. He also said more Americans die every year from the common flu than of coronavirus. He later blamed the financial chaos entirely on Saudi Arabia and Russia's dispute. Analysts are anxious over when the panic will subside. Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, wrote in a Monday memo that investors were waking up 'shell shocked' and that the virus had caused 'complete pandemonium'. He described the Saudi Arabia price war with Russia over oil prices combined with the already nervous markets as a 'one two punch' which added 'another level of unwanted panic to a market already thick with fear.' Johannes Benigni, chairman and founder of JBC Energy Group, told CNBC on Monday: 'We are experiencing, within a short period of time, a demand shock with corona and a supply shock now with OPEC. 'We are making history here...you can call it now a world war of oil. 'It is not that actually Saudi Arabia is taking on Russia which everyone is talking about. They may do that, but Russia always said they want to take on a little bit more of the shale industry.' 'By Saudi Arabia actually now declaring war, they are front-running the Russians in declaring war on U.S. shale.' Saudi Arabia slashed its oil export prices over the weekend and declared a price war with Russia that sent global markets reeling and marked the sharpest decline in oil futures since 1991. The price drop came after Russia refused to sign on with a proposal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production globally as the coronavirus outbreak has slowed the demand for oil. OPEC nations met with allies like Russia on Thursday and Friday in Vienna to reduce oil production by an additional 1.5million barrels per day to stabilize the market starting in April through the end of the year. But Russia refused to join to agreement. From Russia's perspective cutting production would boost US oil producers at the expense of international competitors and lead to a loss in profits. On Saturday, after the group failed to come to a consensus, Saudi Arabia - which runs the world's large oil company Saudi Aramco - slashed its export oil prices to saturate the market and trigger a price war aimed at Russia. Saudi Arabia slashed crude prices to Chinese customers by as much as $6 to $7 a barrel and is looking to boost output by as many as 2million barrels a day. China is the world's biggest oil importer and has purchased oil at cheap prices to stockpile for future use in the past. As a result the Brent global oil benchmark fell dramatically on Sunday by 30 percent,dropping to $31.02 a barrel at its lowest. US West Texas Intermediate crude, the other main price benchmark for oil, dropped 27% to $30 per barrel - the lowest level since February 2016. Sunday's decline in the oil market was the sharpest slump in 29 years since the Gulf War in 1991. Global stock markets took hits on Sunday with the Tokyo stock market index plunging 6.2 percent, Hong Kong 3.9 percent, Sydney 6.1 percent, and Riyadh eight percent. The failed talks marked the first break in a three-year alliance between Saudi Arabia led byCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The alliance was key to competing with a surge in American oil production that turned the US into a major crude exporter for the first time in decades. In response to the price cut Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could, as per Bloomberg. 'If you are Russia, it’s worth it for you to take a three-month price hit to see if you can knock out U.S. oil exports,' Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil and Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said to the New York Times. 'They might be correct for three months but the shale never gets destroyed.' Jaffe said the disagreement between the two nations 'signals that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia is on the skids.' Analysts speculate the actions over the weekend may have been a game between Saudi Arabia and Russia that will end when they come to a compromise. If not, oil prices could tumble to the lowest level in five years. The oil price war is hammering aviation and energy stocks. In early trading, BP was down by 18 percent, Royal Dutch Shell was down 14 percent and ExxonMovil was down 11 percent. Ordinarily, a slump in oil prices offers a boost for airlines because their fuel costs are low. But with the ever-shrinking demand for flights due to the virus, they have been left unable to capitalize. The coronavirus crisis, which has now infected more than 110,000 people globally, has crippled supply chains and prompted cuts to global growth forecasts for 2020. There is no sign that the spread is close to slowing down, either. Traders are now expecting the Federal Reserve to again cut interest rates next week after an emergency reduction on March 3, putting the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury on course for its biggest one-day fall in almost a decade. Shares of rate-sensitive U.S. banks Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo & Co and Morgan Stanley slid between 7.4 percent and 9.6 percent. Marathon Oil Corp, Devon Energy Corp, Apache Corp, Pioneer Natural Resources Co slipped between 22 percent and 28 percent and were some of the biggest losers among S&P 500 components. At 7:12 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 1,255 points, or 4.87p ercent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 145 points, or 4.89 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 410 points, or 4.82 percent. Much of the chaos has been sparked by the failure of a deal between OPEC Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC leader Russia. Generally, the world's largest oil producers agree on production rates and cuts in order to stabilize the industry. With coronavirus slowing demand for supply, they met last week with Russia, which is not part of OPEC but is a large oil producer, to discuss cutting production. Russia refused, setting in motion a chain of events described by analysts as a 'worst case scenario' that could descend into an all-out price war.",real
"A physician's assistant who became New Jersey's first case of coronavirus has spoken out about the disease from his hospital bed and warns others to take the threat seriously. James Cai, 32, fell ill last weekend while attending a medical conference at a hotel in Times Square. He has been hospitalized since Tuesday at the Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, New Jersey. So far, 13 people have been tested for COVID-19 in New Jersey. The other 11 cases have come back negative. 'Every day is getting worse,' Cai said Monday during an interview with CBS, adding that 'it happened so quick'. 'A lot of people say it’s OK, don’t wear masks. I don’t believe that,' Cai said. Cai, who works and lives in Manhattan and Fort Lee, New Jersey, said the virus is not one to be taken lightly. In New York, where Gov Andrew Cuomo recently declared a state of emergency, cases of the coronavirus have shot to 142. Scroll down for video Cai told the network that he's not a smoker and had no underlying health conditions before contracting the virus. Bergen County Executive Jim Tedesco said Cai was in New York over the weekend, went to work last Monday in New York, felt ill and came to Fort Lee Monday evening and then sought treatment. Tedesco stressed 'there was no known contact with anyone here in Fort Lee'. Ihor Sawczuk, a doctor at Hackensack University Hospital, said Cai is 'resting comfortably and doing well'. Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich said Cai lives with his family in New York but has an apartment in Fort Lee and doesn't have school-age children. 'This case is not related to any other cases that we are aware of,' Sokolich said, referring to theWestchester, New York, cases. Following Cai's diagnosis, a woman in her30′s tested positive for the new coronavirus, becoming New Jersey's second case. Acting Gov Sheila Oliver said Thursday that the new case involves a Bergen County woman with mild symptoms, who is in isolation at home. The details came late Thursday, after a news conference when state officials disclosed that the patient had earlier been hospitalized in Englewood, Bergen County, not far from the city. 'As we said in the past, we would not be surprised to see cases in New Jersey,' Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said in a statement. 'But most New Jersey residents are at very low risk of contracting COVID-19.' The details about the second patient came only hours after authorities disclosed information about the first patient. Tedesco said some Bergen County residents who have had contact with people in the Westchester County community where the virus has spread are self-quarantining, but he didn't say how many. There is no further information regarding the second case. It's not yet known how the two patients got the virus. Persichilli said the Health Department is continuing 'infection control options' and asking those who were in contact with the patients to self-quarantine for at least two weeks. Oliver also announced that international travel for state workers is banned for now and said that domestic travel for state workers would need to get approval from the governor's office. Both cases are labeled as 'presumptive' and have been sent to the CDC for confirmation. These developments came as federal health officials said they were providing the state with $1.75million in what they called initial funding to respond to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The US House also passed an $8.3billion bipartisan bill to combat the virus earlier Wednesday. Last month, Democratic Gov Phil Murphy set up a task force to prepare for handling the virus, and Persichilli said a crisis management team has been meeting daily. Persichilli said the state has 700 hospital rooms capable of isolating patients, if needed. Murphy is out of the state after having had surgery to remove what he said was likely a cancerous tumor on his kidney. Officials confirm three new cases in New York City as Mayor Bill de Blasio urges New Yorkers to bike or walk to work Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that three more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in New York City. The mayor urged people to bike or walk to work and to avoid using the subway unless it is essential. The number of cases in New York state jumped to more than 100 over the weekend, including the three new infected patients in New York City. Of the three new patients, two are from Brooklyn and one is from Queens. As the number of cases continued to rise, de Blasio urged New Yorkers to try to reduce overcrowding and acknowledged that subway cars made it difficult for people to avoid direct contact with those who could be potentially infected. Gov Cuomo said on Sunday that officials are working hard to identify new cases but have been greatly hindered by the CDC, saying it is 'outrageous and ludicrous' that the agency has not authorized private labs to conduct automated tests. 'CDC, wake up. Let the states test. Let private labs test. Let's increase as quickly possible our testing capacity so we identify the positive people, so we can isolate them,' the governor said on Sunday. New York currently has seven private labs that could begin running automated tests immediately - processing as many as 2,000 samples per day, Cuomo said. That's a significant improvement on the current rate of roughly 100 per day with manual tests. It was later revealed on Monday that Rick Cotton, the head of New York's Port Authority has tested positive for coronavirus. Cuomo said that Cotton - the executive director of the Port Authority of NY/NJ - is now working from home. He said Cotton had been on the ground at various airports, which the Port Authority controls. Members of his team are being tested and are currently being self-quarantined. There are now 142 cases in New York state with 19 of those in New York City and 98 in Westchester where a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week. Cuomo also unveiled a new state-made sanitizer on Monday.Speaking about the new sanitizer, Cuomo said it was made up of 75 per cent alcohol and will be provided to facilities including schools, the MTA, government run buildings and prisons. The governor said the state currently has the capacity to make 100,000 gallons of the sanitizer per week, adding that it is cheaper for officials to make it instead of buying it on the market. It is being manufactured by Corcraft, which is the company that relies on prisoners in New York to make products, and is being made by inmates at the Great Meadow correctional facility. The state-made sanitizer costs about $6 per gallon to produce, according to Cuomo. He said the production stemmed from reports of price gouging on sanitizer. There are a total of 616 confirmed cases in the United States. A total of 22 people have died from the virus, 19 people in Washington state, two in Florida and one in California. Eight people have recovered from the virus that has spread to 109 countries and infected 111,356 people globally. A total of 3,892 have died from the virus while 62,375 people have recovered. New York Stock Exchange 'kill switch' stops trading for 15 minutes after 7% fall As a result of the global coronavirus panic, trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for 15 minutes on Monday because stocks tumbled so drastically in the first few moments of trading.

President Donald Trump claims the market plunge is 'GOOD for the consumer' because oil prices are coming down Despite the mounting death toll and the huge market plunge, Trump has claimed that everything is 'good'. 'Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!' Trump tweeted Monday. The president then accused the media of 'inflaming' the virus outbreak and dismissed the collapse in oil prices as the result of Saudi Arabia and Russia 'arguing'. As the Dow Jones lost a year's gains, he was shuttling across Florida from Mar-a-Lago to a $100,000-a-head fundraiser. 'Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,' Trump continued in another tweet Monday morning. 'That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!' Trump has not addressed the economic impact of the coronavirus and instead said that the flu was worse than COVID-19. 'So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,' Trump cited in a tweet. 'Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,' he insisted. Thousands prepare to disembark Grand Princess cruise ship hit by coronavirus off the coast of San Francisco Federal and state officials in California prepared to receive thousands of people Monday from a cruise ship that has been idling off the coast of San Francisco with at least 21 people aboard infected with the coronavirus. Personnel covered head to toe in protective gear woke up passengers on the Grand Princess to check whether they were sick. Michele Smith, of Paradise, California, said a doctor knocked on her and her husband’s cabin before dawn and asked if they had a fever or a cough. The couple who went on the cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary are healthy and, like the rest of the 2,400 passengers aboard, have been isolating in their cabins since Thursday. On land, fences were installed at an 11-acre site at the Port of Oakland as authorities readied flights and buses to whisk the passengers aboard the ship to military bases or their home countries for a 14-day quarantine. The more than 3,500 passengers and staff on the ship hail from 54 countries. 'We’re making every effort to get them off the ship as safely and quickly as possible' said Dr John Redd of the US Department of Health and Human Services, who urged passengers to remain in their rooms. California Gov Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought to reassure the public that none of the Grand Princess passengers would be exposed to the US public before completing the quarantine. The Port of Oakland was chosen for docking because of its proximity to an airport and a military base, Newsom said. US passengers will be transported to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia, where they’ll be tested for the COVID-19 virus and quarantined. About 1,100 crew on the ship, 19 of whom have tested positive for the new virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere, Newsom said. Homeless people are twice as likely to contract and spread coronavirus as experts say they are 'a risk to society' They often don’t have places to wash their hands, struggle with health problems and crowd together in grimy camps. That’s what makes homeless people particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. Almost 200,000 people live in those conditions in the United States, according to a White House report, with Washington state, California and Oregon among the states most affected by homelessness as income inequality grows and housing costs rise. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  And — in a possible recipe for disaster — the new virus has hit hardest on the West Coast, where nearly all of the nation’s deaths have occurred. Health officials have not yet reported coronavirus outbreaks among homeless populations, but tuberculosis and other diseases have swept through them in the past, underscoring their vulnerability. Yet few communities that are trying to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus have rolled out plans to protect the homeless and give them a place to recover in isolation, which would prevent them from passing it on. 'They are double risk. One is a risk to themselves, the other is a risk to society,' said Chunhuei Chi, director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University in Corvallis. King County, which includes Seattle and has seen most of the deaths in the US, is one of the few places that’s taken action: installing more than a dozen module units where infected homeless people can recover, some on county-owned land flanked by apartment buildings. The units, roughly the size of a mobile home that accommodate several people, were previously used by oil workers in Texas. County officials also bought a motel where coronavirus patients can recover in isolation. That approach needs to be replicated in many more places, said Chi, who has been closely following the global outbreak that originated in China. 'This should be treated as an emergency policy, not as a permanent solution to homelessness, but more of framing it as a solution for containing the spread,' Chi said. San Francisco says it’s developing a plan to protect the homeless from the virus but hasn’t released details yet Farther south, in Los Angeles County, the health department is sending teams to over 300 homeless facilities to ensure people are washing their hands and not sharing food or utensils, department director Barbara Ferrer said. She’s urging shelters to prepare large spaces to isolate those who may become sick. Health officials in the nation’s most populous county also are planning for a possible large-scale quarantine of homeless people in case the virus spreads, and will deploy street teams to work with those living in encampments to get people with symptoms treated. In Oregon’s capital city, where a makeshift homeless camp has sprouted up on downtown Salem sidewalks, an agency that aids the homeless is bringing in hand-washing stations. 'The homeless population in our community would be in a very difficult position of following all the health care advice that’s coming out right now,' said Jimmy Jones, executive director of the agency Community Action. 'If you’re in a homeless camp, it’s very difficult to wash your hands. It’s very difficult to stay clean. It’s very difficult to practice good hygiene.' Experts say the homeless are more vulnerable because so many have underlying health conditions. So did many patients who have died. Jones said hepatitis C, heart disease and diabetes are prevalent among many of the 1,400 people who sleep on the streets, in cars or abandoned buildings, or in the woods and fields in Salem. 'If they get this particular virus, there’s a high degree of probability it’s going to impact them more severely than it does the general population, with a higher mortality,' Jones said.

The test will allow people experiencing symptoms of coronavirus to swab their noses and then send the samples to a lab for an analysis. The results would then be available within one to two days. Those who test positive would have those results shared with local health officials. Whoever is infected would then be asked to share information online about where they traveled to and with whom they were in contact.",real
"Angelina Joliehas revealed that two of her six children have undergone surgery in the last year. In aTime magazine essay published Sunday in honor of International Women's Day, Jolie wrote that her eldest daughter, 15-year-old Zahara, and one of her younger daughters (either Shiloh, 13, or Vivienne, 11) were operated on. The 44-year-old Maleficent actress did not go into much detail other than that younger child had work done to her hip. Jolie wrote that she was impressed by how the family came together during this time of pain, though there was no mention of the children's father, her ex-husband Brad Pitt. Jolie, who stars in the upcoming film Those Who Wish Me Dead, has bravely admitted to her own operations in the past - including a double mastectomy and having her ovaries removed as a preventative measure to ward off cancer. But this time she's speaking out about her children's procedures. 'I have spent the last two months in and out of surgeries with my eldest daughter and days ago watched her younger sister go under the knife for a hip surgery,' Jolie, a contributing editor for Time, began her essay. 'They know that I am writing this, because I respect their privacy and we discussed it together and they encouraged me to write.' While Jolie never said what Zahara was going through and she did not explain why the younger daughter had hip surgery, she did suggest it was serious. 'They understand that going through medical challenges and fighting to survive and heal is something to be proud of,' Jolie wrote. Describing how the children bonded, she wrote:'I have watched my daughters care for one another. My youngest daughter [Vivienne] studied the nurses with her sister, and then assisted the next time. 'I saw how all my girls so easily stopped everything and put each other first, and felt the joy of being of service to those they love. 'I also watched them their face fears with a resolute bravery.' 'We all know that moment when no one else can help us, and all we can do is close our eyes and breathe. When only we can take the next step or breath through the pain, so we steady ourselves and do it,' she wrote. The mother also brought up her other children - sons Knox, 11, Pax, 16, and Maddox, 18. 'Their brothers were there for them, supportive and sweet,' she wrote. 'But on this International Women's Day, writing from the hospital, I find myself focusing on my daughters for a moment, and all that I have learned from them and other young girls I have met around the world.' The actress, who was lastphotographed in early January while on a shopping trip with her daughter Vivienne, then focused on the power of women in honor of the holiday. 'Little girls' softness, their openness and instinct to nurture and help others, must be appreciated and not abused,' she stated. 'We must do much more to protect them, in all societies: not only against the extreme ways girls' rights are often violated, but also the more subtle injustices and attitudes that so often go unnoticed or excused.' 'So my wish on this day is that we value girls. Care for them. And know that the stronger they grow, the healthier they will be and the more they will give back to their family and community.' And Jolie ended on a message of empowerment. 'And my message to girls is, fight on, little ladies. Your care for each other will be a large part of your way forward,' she wrote. 'Hold your nerve. Know your rights. And never let anyone tell you that you are not precious and special and, above all, equal.' Whenever her kids have been injured it has become news.In 2014 Pax reportedly broke his leg in Thailand and Shiloh broke her arm during a ski accident in December 2017. But there has been no word about recent injuries. Meanwhile, her ex Pitt was seen at a Thundercat event this weekend with a mystery woman. The star was busy earlier this year campaigning for an Oscar, which he received for Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood.",real
"The head ofNew York's Port Authority has tested positive for coronavirus as the number of cases in the state increased to 142 with 19 in New York City.  Governor Andrew Cuomo revealed on Monday thatRick Cotton - the executive director of the Port Authority of NY/NJ - had tested positive for coronavirus and was now working from home. He said Cotton had been on the ground at airports the Port Authority controls amid the outbreak. The Port Authority is in charge of all five airports in New York and New Jersey, including JFK, Newark and LaGuardia. Members of Cotton's team are now also being tested and are currently in self-quarantine. There are now 142 cases in New York state with 19 of those in New York City and 98 in Westchesterwhere a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week. Gov Cuomo also unveiled a new state-made sanitizer on Monday as he gave the update on the increased number of coronavirus cases after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend. Speaking about the new sanitizer, Gov Cuomo said it was made up of75 percent alcohol and will be provided to facilities including schools, the MTA, government run buildings and prisons. Westchester: 98 New York City: 19 Nassau, Long Island: 17 Rockland County: 4 Saratoga: 2 Suffolk County, Long Island: 1 Ulster County: 1 Cuomo said that state currently has the capacity to make 100,000 gallons of the sanitizer per week, adding that it is cheaper for officials to make it instead of buying it on the market. It is being manufactured byCorcraft, which is the company that relies on prisoners in New York to make products, and is beingmade by inamtes at the Great Meadow correctional facility. The state-made sanitizer costs about $6 per gallon to produce, according to Cuomo. He said the production stemmed from reports of price gouging on sanitizer. It comes afterNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged people to bike or walk to work and to avoid using the subway unless it is essential. As the number of cases continued to rise, de Blasio urged New Yorkers to try to reduce overcrowding and acknowledged that subway cars made it difficult for people to avoid direct contact with those who could be potentially infected. He encouraged people to bike or walk to work if they weren't able to work from home. 'We need everyone to do their part in reducing overcrowding. I know that sounds impossible in New York City, but consider some basic steps like telecommuting if your job allows it,' de Blasio tweeted. 'Stagger work schedules so people can arrive later or leave earlier to beat the busiest times of rush hour. 'Plan to have some extra travel time in your commute. If the train that pulls up is too packed, move to a different car or wait to take the next one. Bike or walk to work if you can.' Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  The main cluster of cases in the state remains inWestchester Countywhere a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week and subsequently infected his family and others. Elsewhere in the tri-state area, New Jersey has six cases and Connecticut has reported one case. The outbreak has resulted in a number of schools canceling or suspending in person classes in New York and New Jersey. In New York, Columbia University,Yeshiva University andHofstra University have suspended in-person classes. TheSomers Central, East Ramapo and Scarsdale school districts have also closed.  New Jersey's Princeton University is moving all classes online and will encourage students to remain at home after spring break instead of returning to campus. Mount Olive, South Brunswick, Cranford and Wayne Township school districts have closed temporarily in New Jersey. De Blasio told CNN on Monday that there was a 'high bar' and he doesn't anticipate mass closures for schools. It comes after Gov Cuomo on Saturday announced a state of emergency as the coronavirus continued to spread in the northeastern state. He said the state of emergency 'allows expedited purchasing and expedited hiring, which are the things we need now'. Cuomo said that by declaring a state of emergency, he is able to free up $30 million that can be used for testing and the purchase of protective gear for healthcare workers. The authorities are now 'aggressively testing' 24 hours a day, he said. 'We want to find positives... (then) we can put them in an isolated situation.That's the point of the exercise. You isolate them and you slow the spread.' Cuomo described Westchester, which is where the infected Manhattan attorney lives, as an 'obvious problem'. 'We talk about contagion in clusters; clusters tend to infect more and more people,' he said. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, retirement homes and nursing facilities in the New Rochelle area are banning visits by outsiders. 'We are (being) hypercautious,' Cuomo said. 'I'm not urging calm... I'm urging reality. I'm urging a factual response as opposed to an emotional response... that people understand the information and not the hype.' He added that, at present, there was no need to cancel large gatherings in any part of the state. Cuomo said the quarantine period of 14 days for infected people might be extended. Cases are expected to continue to rise higher amid fears that 40 doctors, nurses and medical staff in a Queens hospital may have been infected by an Uber driver who walked into the hospital and later tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, more than 4,000 people in the state have been urged to self-quarantine to prevent the spread of the disease. Most of those are New York City residents who have returned from the coronavirus hotspots of China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea within the past 14 days. More than half of all U.S. states have reported cases of the coronavirus, which originated in China last year. The US death toll from the disease is currently at 22 with the majority being from Washington state following an outbreak at a nursing home just outside Seattle.",real
"Alarming new pictures show coronavirus patients being treated in intensive care at a hospital in northern Italy, where 16million people are facing quarantine in a drastic new lockdown. The photos show patients surrounded by wires and tubes being treated by medics in full protective suits with gloves, goggles and face masks at the hospital in Cremona. Some patients are lying face-down on their hospital beds, which researchers believe can raise survival rates in intensive care by improving oxygen levels in the blood. The hospital is in Lombardy which is one of the regions sealed off in the toughest quarantine measures that any country has imposed outside China. Italy's prime minister last night pleaded with his citizens to obey the draconian new measures, declaring that 'this is the time to be responsible' after the quarantine took effect in cities including Milan and Venice. 'We want to protect the health of all citizens, we are aware that this will create unease and that these measures will be a sacrifice, big and small,' Giuseppe Conte said in an address last night. 'But this is the time to be responsible. We all must respect and not dodge these measures. 'We should not counter these measures or dodge them, we must think about protecting our health, the health of our beloved ones, the health of our parents, but mainly the health of our grandparents,' he said, warning that older people have proved the most vulnerable to the virus. Italian police were today setting up checkpoints in Lombardy after the wealthy northern region and 14 other provinces were placed into lockdown in a measure which will last until at least April 3. Only people with a 'serious' reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, will be allowed in or out of the 'orange zones'. Anyone who breaks the rules without justification could face three months in prison or a 200-euro fine in a draconian new effort to tackle the crisis. The crisis deepened even further yesterday as Italy's death toll soared from 133 to 366, becoming the highest in the world outside China. The number of confirmed cases in the country also surged by 1,492 to 7,375, making the scale of the Italian outbreak worse than South Korea's. To make matters worse, six people died yesterday in one of several jailhouse riots after prisoners revolted over new rules which banned them from seeing their families over coronavirus fears. Airlines including British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet are still flying passengers to and from coronavirus-ridden regions of northern Italy after swathes of the country were put on lockdown. Return flights to Milan - one of the cities under lockdown - are still being offered by Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways and are all available to book online. Britons returning home from the worst-hit regions are not being checked for the virus upon landing in the UK. The Foreign Office confirmed that nationals returning from northern Italy - the worse-affected region - will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug. British Airways are 'reviewing their schedule' and have offered customers travelling from the quarantined zone full refunds. Customers who booked with BA - which has already scrapped hundreds of long-haul flights due to the killer bug - before April 2 have the option to change theirbooking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead. Meanwhile EasyJet will cancel some flights to and from the region up until April 3 - when the lockdown affecting 16 million people and covering much of the north - including Milan will end. The Foreign Office advises 14 days of self isolation once back in Britain - but there is nothing stopping people from using public transport or entering crowded places on their way home. People evacuated from Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - were quarantined for 14 days in an isolation compound. A BA spokesperson said: 'Following the change to the UK Government travel advice for Northern Italy, we are reviewing our schedule, and have contacted all customers who are due to travel today. 'We are also offering customers booked to fly before April 2, the option to change their booking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead.' An EasyJet spokesperson said: 'We will provide a further update on our schedule in due course.' Weddings and funerals have been banned under the tough new health measures while museums, cinemas, shopping centres and restaurants have all been hit by new restrictions. Bars and restaurants can remain open as long as customers stay three feet apart - but will be shut down if their guests are found to be getting too close to each other. Schools have already been shut down across the country until March 15, with schools and universities in Lombardy and the 'orange zone' areas due to remain closed until at least April 3. The Pope, who has been ill in recent weeks, held his Sunday blessing by video instead of in person and described feeling like he was 'in a cage'. Italian police will be setting up controls at train stations to check people's temperatures, and stopping all cars on main roads in and out to verify the reason for travel, officials said. Cruise ships will be forbidden from docking in Venice, with only passengers who are residents of the lagoon city allowed to disembark. Alitalia suspended national and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport, and announced it was operating only domestic routes from Milan Linate. The borders with Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia remain open. Speaking to La Repubblica, prime minister Conte also vowed a course of 'massive shock therapy' to aid the Italian economy after much of its industrial and business heartland was shut down. The Milan stock market, which was already down some 17 per cent since the outbreak in northern Italy, plunged at Monday's opening, with the blue chip FTMIB index down 11 per cent. Matching similar calls from France, Conte said strict European Union borrowing limits should be loosened to allow more room for manoeuvre, and that the flexibility envisaged by the EU's budget rules should be used 'in full'. 'Europe cannot think of confronting an extraordinary situation with ordinary measures,' he said. The European Commission told Italy on Saturday that its planned extra spending in response to the outbreak would not be counted in measuring its compliance with EU budget rules. 'The economic measures in the works will be vigorous, commensurate to current needs, but temporary,' the economy ministry said, adding that Italy remained committed to reducing its debt as soon as possible. The ministry also said it would 'spare no effort' in ensuring that measures were agreed at a European level. While a quarter ofItaly's population faces life in quarantine, Britons in the coronavirus-ridden zone are free to travel home without restrictions. British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet still have Milan flights available to book on their website. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that British tourists in the northern parts of the country 'are free to return home or complete their holiday' under guidelines from the Italian government. They said UK nationals will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug which has so killed more than 3,600 worldwide and has infected more than 100,000. The FCO updated its advice on Sunday night, advising against all but essential travel to a wider area of northern Italy due to the crisis. The move has been made following consultations with Italian authorities and the chief medical officer, the department said. Public Health England says all cabin crew are briefed on coronavirus symptoms and what to do if someone reports feeling ill onboard a flight. The captain is to call ahead to warn of any illness and a risk assessment will be carried out before passengers are let off the plane. It is possible to transmit the virus without any symptoms. A 'bespoke poster for Italy' will be given to travellers from Italy to inform them of what areas are affected. Information on symptoms and actions are provided to passengers. This protocol has been in place for northern Italy since March 4 and will be rolled out for the whole of Italy by March 11. Heathrow Airport says it has 'enhanced thorough cleaning processes and increased the amount of hand sanitisers for staff. Vincenzo Tosetti, a 34-year old actor and Venice resident, said that 'many people I know have fled, mainly from Milan. 'This is going to test the Italians' ability to behave responsibly, and I have to say that up until now they've been failing. There's been an exodus'. Fellow Venetian Giancarlo, 49, who did not want to give his last name, said 'you can feel the anxiety in the air'. The floating city was also virtually empty of tourists, which was 'a big blow'. 'First the city was hit by record floods [last autumn], now this. Venice is very fragile right now,' he said. The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions, and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy's less well medically equipped south. The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown - which include the cities of Parma and Rimini - to 'stop and turn around'. 'Get off (the train) at the first station, don't get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don't bring the epidemic to Puglia,' he said on Facebook. 'You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,' he said. Meanwhile, six prisoners have died after a series of jailhouse riots across Italywhich were sparked by tough new measures to stop the spread of the virus. Inmates set their prison on fire in Modena yesterday in an angry protest over a ban on family visits, unions said. Six inmates are confirmed to have died, including three who had been transferred to different prisons as authorities tried to quell the uprising. Justice ministry sources said two of the deaths in Modena were caused by an overdose from drugs found in the jail infirmaries, while a third prisoner was found blue in the face and their cause of death was still unclear. Police were today clashing with relatives who had gathered outside the jail, in northern Italy which is at the centre of the virus outbreak. The riot was one of several around the country with other disturbances taking place in Salerno, Naples and Milan among others. According to Il Corriere, a group of 60 inmates set fire to the prison in Modena after the tough new measures were announced. Footage broadcast by local media showed police and fire trucks outside the prison as black smoke swirled into the sky. Around 500 people were at risk of escaping until authorities laid siege to the penitentiary and eventually stormed the building. Once inside, they discovered a 'surreal scene and a devastated building', reports say, seizing a supply of drugs. The head of Italy's prison service, Francesco Basentini, said three inmates had at the jail and three others had died after being transferred to other prisons. 'There have been a series of rebellions across the country,' Basentini said in a televised interview. Prison officers' union Sappe said some 80 prisoners had been transferred to other jails after the uprising. 'The inmates that have been moved were those who managed to reach the yard in a bid to escape,' Seppe's secretary general Giovanni Battista Durante said. 'We are told other prisoners inside the jail have barricaded themselves in and probably have illegal weapons'. He said colleagues from the prison had told him the jail had been 'completely destroyed'. News of the impending quarantine was leaked to Italian media early, prompting further chaos as people rushed to get out of the affected areas. The leak infuriated Conte, who slammed it as 'unacceptable', saying it had created 'uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion'. Pina Antinucci, a psychoanalyst in her 60s who lives in Milan, told AFP she was suffering nightmares and felt the state was 'bombarding us with anxieties, spreading paranoia'. 'I'd like to know if I'm infected... it would be better to know if I have that unwanted guest who occupies our homes, minds and lives,' she said. Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who identified the Italian strain last month, said the leak had been a 'disastrous communication error' and 'absolute idiocracy'. Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak on Twitter as 'pure madness'. 'The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,' he said on social media. AirlineAlitalia said it was suspending national and international flights to and from Milan's Malpensa airport from March 9 after the government ordered a lockdown of large areas of northern Italy. In a statement, the Italian flag carrier said it would operate only national flights from the smaller Milan Linate airport, and reduce the number of flights between Venice and Rome. International routes will be served from Rome's Fiumicino airport. The new regime will continue until at least April 3, the airline said. Meanwhile, Pope Francis broke with centuries of tradition by enlisting the help of technology for his weekly Angelus prayer. 'I am close through prayer with the people who suffer from the current coronavirus epidemic,' the 83-year-old pontiff said in a message recorded at the Vatican library and aired live on a screen on Saint Peter's Square. The Pope himself tested negative for the contagion after he fell ill on Ash Wednesday with symptoms of a cold including a cough, fever, chills and sore throat. Italian football was also plunged into chaos as Serie A match between Parma and SPAL faced a last-minute delay following a call from Italy's sports minister to suspend the league during the outbreak. Players faced a75-minute wait for kick-off inside an empty stadium as officials considered an appeal from sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora minutes before the scheduled start. Spadafora said he supported a call from Italian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi to avoid putting players at risk amid the virus outbreak. Some had voiced growing anger over the idea of having to play matches during the coronavirus outbreak. 'It doesn't make sense right now, when we're requesting enormous sacrifices of our citizens in order to stop the spread of contagion, to put at risk the health of the players, referees, coaches and fans,' Spadafora said. The Italian league replied that it was following government orders to hold games in empty stadiums. 'The repeated and contrasting government statements only add to the general state of confusion and definitely don't help the system overcome the difficult time caused by the virus,' a league statement said. Five Serie A matches took place Sunday, beginning with Parma v Spal at lunchtime and concluding with Juventus v Inter Milan in the evening. All of the matches had already been postponed from last weekend. An appeal by Spadafora for this weekend's games to be shown on free TV 'considering the serious inconvenience affecting the population in this difficult time' was rejected by the league. 'The minister has gone from asking for the games to be shown for free to suspending the league, amid a decree to play behind closed doors,' Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini said. 'Italy needs clarity and gravitas right now, not populist proclamations.'",real
"Saudi Arabia slashed its oil export prices over the weekend and declared a price war with Russia that sent global markets reeling and marked the sharpest decline in oil futures since 1991. The price drop came after Russia refused to sign on with a proposal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production globally as the coronavirus outbreak has slowed the demand for oil. OPEC nations met with allies like Russia on Thursday and Friday in Vienna to reduce oil production by an additional 1.5million barrels per day to stabilize the market starting in April through the end of the year. But Russia refused to join to agreement. From Russia's perspective cutting production would boost US oil producers at the expense of international competitors and lead to a loss in profits. On Saturday, after the group failed to come to a consensus, Saudi Arabia - which runs the world's large oil company Saudi Aramco - slashed its export oil prices to saturate the market and trigger a price war aimed at Russia. Saudi Arabia slashed crude prices to Chinese customers by as much as $6 to $7 a barrel and is looking to boost output by as many as 2million barrels a day. China is the world's biggest oil importer and has purchased oil at cheap prices to stockpile for future use in the past. As a result the Brent global oil benchmark fell dramatically on Sunday by 30 percent,dropping to $31.02 a barrel at its lowest. US West Texas Intermediate crude, the other main price benchmark for oil, dropped 27% to $30 per barrel - the lowest level since February 2016. Sunday's decline in the oil market was the sharpest slump in 29 years since the Gulf War in 1991. Global stock markets took hits on Sunday with the Tokyo stock market index plunging 6.2 percent, Hong Kong 3.9 percent, Sydney 6.1 percent, and Riyadh eight percent. The failed talks marked the first break in a three-year alliance between Saudi Arabia led byCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The alliance was key to competing with a surge in American oil production that turned the US into a major crude exporter for the first time in decades. In response to the price cut Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could, as per Bloomberg. 'If you are Russia, it’s worth it for you to take a three-month price hit to see if you can knock out U.S. oil exports,' Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil and Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said to the New York Times. 'They might be correct for three months but the shale never gets destroyed.' Jaffe said the disagreement between the two nations 'signals that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia is on the skids.' Analysts speculate the actions over the weekend may have been a game between Saudi Arabia and Russia that will end when they come to a compromise. If not, oil prices could tumble to the lowest level in five years. 'If a true price war ensues, there will be plenty of pain in the oil markets,'Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, a United Arab Emirates oil company, said to theNew York Times.'Many will be bracing for the economic and geopolitical shocks of a low-price environment.' If the oil market plunge doesn't stop it could lead to a US recession and threaten President Donald Trump's bid for re-election, experts say. 'We are in an Armageddon situation. We could move down 30% in the equity markets in the next 30 days. We are at floor 8 after a jump off a 20-story building,' analyst John Lekas, the CEO of Leader Capital based in Vancouver, Washington, said to Reuters. 'The 10 year is your growth rate, give or take a little. That means growth in essence went from a little over two to basically zero overnight. Two quarters of negative gross domestic product is a recession. We will most likely get that. 'It also puts U.S. President Donald Trump's election at risk. The market has not caught up to the facts.' A silver lining for the drop in oil prices is the reduced price of a gallon of regular gasoline at US gas stations. According to the AAA Motor Club, the cost of a gallon at the pump has already fallen five cents in the last week from $2.45 to $2.40. Prices could drop to below $2 per gallon in some states in the coming weeks, experts speculate. However, the price collapse could eventually harm American oil companies, as dozens have already gone out of business in recent years. Furthermore, the drop in global oil prices could lead to a decline in American oil production. A drop in oil prices could also hurt producers around the world - especially Venezuela and Iran, both of whose oil-based economies are under pressure from American sanctions. Saudi Arabia already felt the impact of the price drop, as shares of Saudi Aramco plummeted more than nine percent on Sunday - dropping below its December initial public offering price of 32 riyals ($8.53 USD) for the first time. The Saudi oil price cut was the largest cut in at least 20 years. The Riyadh stock exchange fell more than eight percent. Now Saudi Arabia is preparing to amp up their oil output to a reported 10million to 12 millionbarrels per day to compensate for the revenue lost. Saudi Arabia already produces a whopping 9.7million barrels of oil a day. 'Saudi Arabia is protecting its market position in the face of a collapse in oil demand, a shrinking physical market and greatly reduced prices,' Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, said to the Times. 'We believe the OPEC and Russia oil price war unequivocally started this weekend when Saudi Arabia aggressively cut the relative price at which it sells its crude by the most in at least 20 year,' Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said to clients in a statement Sunday. 'The prognosis for the oil market is even more dire than in November 2014, when such a price war last started, as it comes to a head with the significant collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus.' Saudi Arabia's audacious market move comes after the monarchy was rocked with scandal over the weekend. On Friday the brother and nephew of the Saudi king Salman were arrest over an alleged plot to oust him and his son Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason. Saudi royal guards detained the two and one other person, in a move that signaled Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tightening grip on power. The brother and nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Salman have been arrested over a plot to oust the king and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason. They were taken from their homes early on Friday by black-clad royal guards, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Saudi royal court has accused the two men, once potential contenders for the throne, of 'plotting a coup to unseat the king and crown prince' and could face lifetime imprisonment or execution, the newspaper said. Prince Nayef, a once powerful figure as head of Saudi counter terrorism efforts, had been crown prince until 2017. King Salman took away the title and put his son - Prince Mohammed bin Salman - first in line for the throne. The New York Times also reported his and Prince Ahmed's detention, adding that Prince Nayef's younger brother, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef, had also been detained. The detentions mark the latest crackdown by Prince Mohammed, who has consolidated his grip on power with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites. Prince Mohammed has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October 2018. He was accused of ordering the journalist's murder, and the killing sparked calls for him to be replaced as Crown Prince. He was also accused of hacking the phone of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos after the pair swapped numbers. Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 84-year-old father King Salman. 'Prince Mohammed is emboldened - he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,' Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation, said of the latest crackdown. 'This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone - including royals - not to cross him.' Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy. Just before his return in October 2018, the prince had courted controversy over remarks he made to protesters in London chanting against Saudi royals over the kingdom's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Yemen. 'What does the family have to do with it? Certain individuals are responsible... the king and the crown prince,' he said, according to a widely-circulated online video of the incident. The comment was seen by many as rare criticism of the kingdom's leadership and its role in Yemen, but Prince Ahmed dismissed that interpretation as 'inaccurate'. Prince Mohammed had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, in 2017 to become heir to the Arab world's most powerful throne. At the time, Saudi television channels showed Prince Mohammed kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence. Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities. The same year that Prince Nayef was stripped of his crown prince status, Prince Mohammed ordered a sweeping crackdown, arresting senior members of the royal family and billionaire businessmen. He claimed it was a bid to tackle corruption. The group of the country's most powerful figures were held in a function room at the Ritz Carlton hotel in their home country. Pictures showed them sleeping on mattresses on the floor. A source told MailOnline at the time that the men were being strung up by their feet and beaten by American private security contractors. Among those arrested on allegations of corruption was Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Saudi King's nephew who is worth more than $17bn according to Forbes, and owns stakes in Twitter, Lyft and Citigroup. He was stripped of his position as National Guards chief. The Saudi crown prince, according to the source, also confiscated more than $194 billion from the bank accounts and seized assets of those arrested. The source said that Salman, often referred to by his initials MBS, was conducting some of the interrogations on the princes and billionaries himself. 'When it's something big he asks them questions,' the source said. 'He speaks to them very nicely in the interrogation, and then he leaves the room, and the mercenaries go in. The prisoners are slapped, insulted, hung up, tortured.' Prince Mohammed did win plaudits from Western leaders after he introduced some moderate reforms - allowing women in Saudi Arabia to drive for the first time ever and introducing cinemas to the country. The Crown Prince - also known simply as MBS - also reined in the country's fierce and ultra conservative religious police. Leaders including Theresa May and Donald Trump have rolled out the red carpet for him during his lavish visits. The latest detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam's holiest sites to contain the novel coronavirus. The kingdom has suspended the 'umrah' year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj - a key pillar of Islam. The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with the plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue.",real
"Donald Trump claimed the plunging stock market was 'good' for consumers because it is based on cheaper gas Monday as Wall Street faced a fall so dramatic trading was briefly halted. 'Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!' Trump tweeted Monday, one of a string of tweets accusing the 'fake news' of prompting the sell-off. He accused the media of 'inflaming' the virus outbreak and dismissed the collapse in oil prices as the result of Saudi Arabia and Russia 'arguing.' As the Dow Jones lost a year's gains, he was shuttling across Florida from Mar-a-Lago to a $100,000-a-head fundraiser - and tweeting that flu was worse than coronavirus. 'Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,' Trump continued in another tweet Monday morning. 'That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!' Markets all over the world plummeted Monday over the growing threat of the virus spreading, but Trump has not addressed the economic impact as the coronavirus death toll bypassed 20 in the U.S. Global markets opened with big losses Monday morning as the economy saw its worst day in more than 10 years. Trump continued to downplay the threat, citing that more people died from the flu last year, and insisting life and the economy will 'go on' even over the escalation in coronavirus outbreak. 'So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,' Trump cited in a tweet. 'Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,' he insisted. 'At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!' The president has repeatedly expressed incredulity at the number of flu deaths, and the idea that people die of it. In 1918, his grandfather Freidrich died of Spanish flu. Trump claims that media outlets are working with Democrats to make the coronavirus outbreak seem worse than it is. 'The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant,' the president tweeted Monday morning. 'Surgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American,'' he continued, quoting U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams. 'So much FAKE NEWS!' he lamented in a separate tweet Monday morning. Trump's claims comes as the death toll in the U.S. reached 22 on Monday and cases continued to spread to new areas of the country, including the first confirmed case in Washington, D.C. Kansas and Missouri also announced their first cases over the weekend as the cases number now exceeds 600. The most U.S. deaths occurred in Washington state after the virus spread among residents at a nursing facility in a suburb of Seattle. But Trump insists the threat is less serious than is being portrayed by media reports and Democratic lawmakers. He then praised himself in another tweet Monday morning for banning travel from high-risk countries early on in the outbreak. 'The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives,' Trump lauded of his administration. 'Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world!' Trump stopped travel from certain countries to the U.S., including from China and Iran – and Americans have been warned of traveling to other high-risk countries like Italy and South Korea. The president is usually the first to address stock market gains under his administration, but since coronavirus has caused markets to fall, he has remained largely silent on the matter. Earlier this month, the U.S. saw its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis and on Monday markets plunged nearly 7 per cent. Markets in Asia, Europe and the Middle East also opened sharply lower on Monday as investors came to grips with the global spread of coronavirus. Economic experts claimed Monday morning that investors are waking up 'shell shocked,' as oil markets crashed. The global market plunged, causing the worst one-day crash in crude oil prices in 30 years, after Saudi Arabia launched a price war. On Friday Russia refused to follow OPEC's efforts to stop market plummets caused by the escalation of the coronavirus outbreak. Last month, Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence to head the task force addressing the coronavirus crisis. 'Great job being done by the @VP and the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you!' Trump tweeted Monday. Coronavirus has infected more than 108,000 people worldwide and is throwing many countries' economies into turmoil. The number of confirmed cases in New York rose by 13 over the weekend, nearing the state total to 90. New York governor Andrew Cuomo issued a declaration of emergency in the state. But Trump claimed late Sunday night that the messaging from Cuomo is 'political weaponization' of the coronavirus. 'There are no mixed messages, only political weaponization by people like you and your brother, Fredo!' Trump insisted in his tweet, making reference to Cuomo's brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo.",real
"A top official at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has compared the coronavirus outbreak to the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Dr Anthony Fauci has been director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984 and was a central figure during the global crisis. He said that while the virus at the center of each are different, the fear and anxiety among the general public are similar. 'It's not that different than the very early years of the HIV epidemic, of the anthrax attacks, of the concern about the pre-pandemic bird flu,' Dr Fauci told CNN's New Day. 'Everything has a little bit of a different twist to it. It's not exactly the same, but there's always that uncertainty that gets people very anxious.' However, Dr Fauci also stressed that researchers are collecting new data every day because so much about the virus is unknown. 'We're gathering information, we're learning a lot, but there's still a lot that's unknown about where this is going,' he told hostAlisyn Camerota. 'You always almost have a fog of war about it.' Other recent comments from Dr Fauci signaled a change in tone from the administration regarding who is most at risk. He stated that those with underlying health conditions are much more likely to suffer complications if they contract the disease. ""If you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,' he told Meet the Press on Sunday. 'If you're a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, you need to think twice about getting on a plane, on a long trip.' This echoes past remarks from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has stated that people with pre-existing conditions are twice as likely to have serious outcomes compared to healthy people. It comes as The Associated Press reports that the White House overruled a CDC warning advising elderly and 'physical fragile' Americans from flying. The CDC allegedly submitted the plan among a list of recommendations to control the spread of the virus, but the Trump administration demanded it be removed. Officials denied the report, including Katie Miller, the spokeswoman for Vice President Pence, who called it 'complete fiction.' There have been complaints for weeks that President Donald Trump has been trying to downplay how severe the outbreak is, leading to mixed messaging from the administration. In spite of the contradictions, Dr Fauci says he hopes the coronavirus outbreak disappears similarly to how SARS did in 2003. However, because coronavirus could be a seasonal disease, he said a vaccine is vital - but is more than a year away from being able to be distributed. Worldwide, more than 111,000 people have been infected and nearly 3,900 people have died. In the US, there are more than 600 cases in 34 states and 22 people - in California, Florida and Washington - have died.",real
"Oil stocks were the biggest losers on the Footsie today after an an oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia broke out at the weekend, sending crude prices tumble by over 30 per cent. FTSE 100 heavyweight BP fell as much as 23 per cent to close 19 per cent lower, while Shell ended the day 18 per cent down. FTSE 250-listed Premier Oil and Tullow were down 57 per cent and 31 per cent respectively at the close on Monday. It comes as Russia refused to agree to production cuts which would have served to prop up oil prices in the wake of falling demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. That led to a strong response from Saudi Arabia, which said it would not bear the brunt of the cuts and increased its own oil production, hence pushing prices lower. Oil prices crashed more than 30 per cent to just $31 per barrel overnight, down from $45 on Friday night, in their biggest one day decline since the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991. They have since regained some losses, but were still down 18 per cent at $36.86 on Monday afternoon. The fall in the price of oil sent markets around the world tumble, with the FTSE 100 losing as much as 8.5 per cent at the open. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said the sharp fall in oil prices called into question the sustainability of BP and Shell's dividends, which are both in excess of 10 per cent. 'While this seems quite attractive it also needs to be set in the context of share price declines year to date of over 35 per cent for Royal Dutch Shell and over 30 per cent for BP,' he said. 'BP's problems are particularly acute given their acquisition of BHP Billiton's shale assets a couple of years ago, for $10billion. 'With a gearing of over 30 per cent and a breakeven price of just below $50 a sustained period of lower oil prices is going to be painful and could well mean that shareholders might have to absorb a dividend cut.' Analysts believe that Russia and Saudi Arabia can cope with lower oil prices for a while, but those who will bear the brunt of the slump are US shale producers - and oil giants like BP and Shell. 'The ones who won't be able to take a prolonged period of low prices are US shale producers, and actually, most of the oil majors,' said City Index's analyst Matt Weller. 'Investors have already cottoned on to that, selling off BP and Shell this morning to the tune of almost 20%. Chevron and Exxon will also be in the firing line.' 'But the weakest links are US shale producers because they require oil prices of between $45 and $54 a barrel to break even.' Shares in US oil giants Chevron andExxon were also down, by 12 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Russ Mould at AJ Bell said Saudi Arabia's decision to enter a price war may not necessarily help it grab market share from US shale producers. 'A previous attempt between 2014 and 2016 to grab market share by pushing US shale oil producers out of business was ultimately a failure. The weakest operators in North America were wheedled out and the rest improved the efficiency of their operations and refined their technology. 'Time will tell if it plays out differently in 2020 but, unless there is a rapid recovery, the collapse in crude is likely to put significant strain on state finances in both Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as other countries which are major producers of oil. 'Conversely a falling oil price may provide some respite to consumers of oil amid the coronavirus disruption as it feeds through into lower costs for transport and energy.' ",real
"Alarming new pictures show coronavirus patients being treated in intensive care at a hospital in northern Italy, where 16million people are facing quarantine in a drastic new lockdown. The photos show patients surrounded by wires and tubes being treated by medics in full protective suits with gloves, goggles and face masks at the hospital in Cremona. Some patients are lying face-down on their hospital beds, which researchers believe can raise survival rates in intensive care by improving oxygen levels in the blood. The hospital is in Lombardy which is one of the regions sealed off in the toughest quarantine measures that any country has imposed outside China. Italy's prime minister last night pleaded with his citizens to obey the draconian new measures, declaring that 'this is the time to be responsible' after the quarantine took effect in cities including Milan and Venice. 'We want to protect the health of all citizens, we are aware that this will create unease and that these measures will be a sacrifice, big and small,' Giuseppe Conte said in an address last night. 'But this is the time to be responsible. We all must respect and not dodge these measures. 'We should not counter these measures or dodge them, we must think about protecting our health, the health of our beloved ones, the health of our parents, but mainly the health of our grandparents,' he said, warning that older people have proved the most vulnerable to the virus. Italian police were today setting up checkpoints in Lombardy after the wealthy northern region and 14 other provinces were placed into lockdown in a measure which will last until at least April 3. Only people with a 'serious' reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, will be allowed in or out of the 'orange zones'. Anyone who breaks the rules without justification could face three months in prison or a 200-euro fine in a draconian new effort to tackle the crisis. The crisis deepened even further yesterday as Italy's death toll soared from 133 to 366, becoming the highest in the world outside China. The number of confirmed cases in the country also surged by 1,492 to 7,375, making the scale of the Italian outbreak worse than South Korea's. To make matters worse, six people died yesterday in one of several jailhouse riots after prisoners revolted over new rules which banned them from seeing their families over coronavirus fears. Airlines including British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet are still flying passengers to and from coronavirus-ridden regions of northern Italy after swathes of the country were put on lockdown. Return flights to Milan - one of the cities under lockdown - are still being offered by Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways and are all available to book online. Britons returning home from the worst-hit regions are not being checked for the virus upon landing in the UK. The Foreign Office confirmed that nationals returning from northern Italy - the worse-affected region - will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug. British Airways are 'reviewing their schedule' and have offered customers travelling from the quarantined zone full refunds. Customers who booked with BA - which has already scrapped hundreds of long-haul flights due to the killer bug - before April 2 have the option to change theirbooking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead. Meanwhile EasyJet will cancel some flights to and from the region up until April 3 - when the lockdown affecting 16 million people and covering much of the north - including Milan will end. The Foreign Office advises 14 days of self isolation once back in Britain - but there is nothing stopping people from using public transport or entering crowded places on their way home. People evacuated from Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - were quarantined for 14 days in an isolation compound. A BA spokesperson said: 'Following the change to the UK Government travel advice for Northern Italy, we are reviewing our schedule, and have contacted all customers who are due to travel today. 'We are also offering customers booked to fly before April 2, the option to change their booking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead.' An EasyJet spokesperson said: 'We will provide a further update on our schedule in due course.' Weddings and funerals have been banned under the tough new health measures while museums, cinemas, shopping centres and restaurants have all been hit by new restrictions. Bars and restaurants can remain open as long as customers stay three feet apart - but will be shut down if their guests are found to be getting too close to each other. Schools have already been shut down across the country until March 15, with schools and universities in Lombardy and the 'orange zone' areas due to remain closed until at least April 3. The Pope, who has been ill in recent weeks, held his Sunday blessing by video instead of in person and described feeling like he was 'in a cage'. Italian police will be setting up controls at train stations to check people's temperatures, and stopping all cars on main roads in and out to verify the reason for travel, officials said. Cruise ships will be forbidden from docking in Venice, with only passengers who are residents of the lagoon city allowed to disembark. Alitalia suspended national and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport, and announced it was operating only domestic routes from Milan Linate. The borders with Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia remain open. Speaking to La Repubblica, prime minister Conte also vowed a course of 'massive shock therapy' to aid the Italian economy after much of its industrial and business heartland was shut down. The Milan stock market, which was already down some 17 per cent since the outbreak in northern Italy, plunged at Monday's opening, with the blue chip FTMIB index down 11 per cent. Matching similar calls from France, Conte said strict European Union borrowing limits should be loosened to allow more room for manoeuvre, and that the flexibility envisaged by the EU's budget rules should be used 'in full'. 'Europe cannot think of confronting an extraordinary situation with ordinary measures,' he said. The European Commission told Italy on Saturday that its planned extra spending in response to the outbreak would not be counted in measuring its compliance with EU budget rules. 'The economic measures in the works will be vigorous, commensurate to current needs, but temporary,' the economy ministry said, adding that Italy remained committed to reducing its debt as soon as possible. The ministry also said it would 'spare no effort' in ensuring that measures were agreed at a European level. While a quarter ofItaly's population faces life in quarantine, Britons in the coronavirus-ridden zone are free to travel home without restrictions. British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet still have Milan flights available to book on their website. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that British tourists in the northern parts of the country 'are free to return home or complete their holiday' under guidelines from the Italian government. They said UK nationals will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug which has so killed more than 3,600 worldwide and has infected more than 100,000. The FCO updated its advice on Sunday night, advising against all but essential travel to a wider area of northern Italy due to the crisis. The move has been made following consultations with Italian authorities and the chief medical officer, the department said. Public Health England says all cabin crew are briefed on coronavirus symptoms and what to do if someone reports feeling ill onboard a flight. The captain is to call ahead to warn of any illness and a risk assessment will be carried out before passengers are let off the plane. It is possible to transmit the virus without any symptoms. A 'bespoke poster for Italy' will be given to travellers from Italy to inform them of what areas are affected. Information on symptoms and actions are provided to passengers. This protocol has been in place for northern Italy since March 4 and will be rolled out for the whole of Italy by March 11. Heathrow Airport says it has 'enhanced thorough cleaning processes and increased the amount of hand sanitisers for staff. Vincenzo Tosetti, a 34-year old actor and Venice resident, said that 'many people I know have fled, mainly from Milan. 'This is going to test the Italians' ability to behave responsibly, and I have to say that up until now they've been failing. There's been an exodus'. Fellow Venetian Giancarlo, 49, who did not want to give his last name, said 'you can feel the anxiety in the air'. The floating city was also virtually empty of tourists, which was 'a big blow'. 'First the city was hit by record floods [last autumn], now this. Venice is very fragile right now,' he said. The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions, and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy's less well medically equipped south. The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown - which include the cities of Parma and Rimini - to 'stop and turn around'. 'Get off (the train) at the first station, don't get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don't bring the epidemic to Puglia,' he said on Facebook. 'You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,' he said. Meanwhile, six prisoners have died after a series of jailhouse riots across Italywhich were sparked by tough new measures to stop the spread of the virus. Inmates set their prison on fire in Modena yesterday in an angry protest over a ban on family visits, unions said. Six inmates are confirmed to have died, including three who had been transferred to different prisons as authorities tried to quell the uprising. Justice ministry sources said two of the deaths in Modena were caused by an overdose from drugs found in the jail infirmaries, while a third prisoner was found blue in the face and their cause of death was still unclear. Police were today clashing with relatives who had gathered outside the jail, in northern Italy which is at the centre of the virus outbreak. The riot was one of several around the country with other disturbances taking place in Salerno, Naples and Milan among others. According to Il Corriere, a group of 60 inmates set fire to the prison in Modena after the tough new measures were announced. Footage broadcast by local media showed police and fire trucks outside the prison as black smoke swirled into the sky. Around 500 people were at risk of escaping until authorities laid siege to the penitentiary and eventually stormed the building. Once inside, they discovered a 'surreal scene and a devastated building', reports say, seizing a supply of drugs. The head of Italy's prison service, Francesco Basentini, said three inmates had at the jail and three others had died after being transferred to other prisons. 'There have been a series of rebellions across the country,' Basentini said in a televised interview. Prison officers' union Sappe said some 80 prisoners had been transferred to other jails after the uprising. 'The inmates that have been moved were those who managed to reach the yard in a bid to escape,' Seppe's secretary general Giovanni Battista Durante said. 'We are told other prisoners inside the jail have barricaded themselves in and probably have illegal weapons'. He said colleagues from the prison had told him the jail had been 'completely destroyed'. News of the impending quarantine was leaked to Italian media early, prompting further chaos as people rushed to get out of the affected areas. The leak infuriated Conte, who slammed it as 'unacceptable', saying it had created 'uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion'. Pina Antinucci, a psychoanalyst in her 60s who lives in Milan, told AFP she was suffering nightmares and felt the state was 'bombarding us with anxieties, spreading paranoia'. 'I'd like to know if I'm infected... it would be better to know if I have that unwanted guest who occupies our homes, minds and lives,' she said. Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who identified the Italian strain last month, said the leak had been a 'disastrous communication error' and 'absolute idiocracy'. Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak on Twitter as 'pure madness'. 'The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,' he said on social media. AirlineAlitalia said it was suspending national and international flights to and from Milan's Malpensa airport from March 9 after the government ordered a lockdown of large areas of northern Italy. In a statement, the Italian flag carrier said it would operate only national flights from the smaller Milan Linate airport, and reduce the number of flights between Venice and Rome. International routes will be served from Rome's Fiumicino airport. The new regime will continue until at least April 3, the airline said. Meanwhile, Pope Francis broke with centuries of tradition by enlisting the help of technology for his weekly Angelus prayer. 'I am close through prayer with the people who suffer from the current coronavirus epidemic,' the 83-year-old pontiff said in a message recorded at the Vatican library and aired live on a screen on Saint Peter's Square. The Pope himself tested negative for the contagion after he fell ill on Ash Wednesday with symptoms of a cold including a cough, fever, chills and sore throat. Italian football was also plunged into chaos as Serie A match between Parma and SPAL faced a last-minute delay following a call from Italy's sports minister to suspend the league during the outbreak. Players faced a75-minute wait for kick-off inside an empty stadium as officials considered an appeal from sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora minutes before the scheduled start. Spadafora said he supported a call from Italian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi to avoid putting players at risk amid the virus outbreak. Some had voiced growing anger over the idea of having to play matches during the coronavirus outbreak. 'It doesn't make sense right now, when we're requesting enormous sacrifices of our citizens in order to stop the spread of contagion, to put at risk the health of the players, referees, coaches and fans,' Spadafora said. The Italian league replied that it was following government orders to hold games in empty stadiums. 'The repeated and contrasting government statements only add to the general state of confusion and definitely don't help the system overcome the difficult time caused by the virus,' a league statement said. Five Serie A matches took place Sunday, beginning with Parma v Spal at lunchtime and concluding with Juventus v Inter Milan in the evening. All of the matches had already been postponed from last weekend. An appeal by Spadafora for this weekend's games to be shown on free TV 'considering the serious inconvenience affecting the population in this difficult time' was rejected by the league. 'The minister has gone from asking for the games to be shown for free to suspending the league, amid a decree to play behind closed doors,' Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini said. 'Italy needs clarity and gravitas right now, not populist proclamations.'",real
"The father of a Missouri woman who tested positive forcoronavirusviolated self-quarantine rules to attend a school dance with his younger daughter. The family, from St Louis, were asked to self-isolate by health officials after the woman, in her 20s, called the county's health hotline to report a high fever and cough. She arrived back in the U.S. at Chicago's O'Haire Airport on March 3 after a study trip to Italy. A day later, she took a home to St Louis after spending a night at a friend's place, prompting Amtrak to shut down that line. Amtrak has since started notifying other passengers who were on Amtrak train 303 at the time, and said it was out of service as it disinfects and cleans both the trains and the stations at Chicago and St Louis. The woman was tested for COVID-19 on March 6, and the results came back positive the next day. It comes as the number of positive coronavirus cases in the U.S. climbed to more than 600, and the death toll climbed to 22. The St Louis woman is believed to be the first person in the region to test positive for the virus. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Despite the instruction to self-isolate, the patient's father attended a father-daughter dinner dance hosted by the Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School at the Ritz-Carlton in Clayton with his younger child on Saturday. The school has since informed parents of its decision to close today in order to 'gather information and guidance from health officials'. In a letter to parents, school officials said the father and daughter didn't learn about the diagnosis until they were already at the dance, which was scheduled to begin at 6.30pm. The family members immediately left once notified. In a statement on Sunday, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said the coronavirus patient's father 'did not act consistently with thehealth department's instructions and instead ... he decided to take his daughter to a school function.' He added that thecounty health department sent the family a letter on Sunday informing them they must follow its guidelines, St Louis Public Radioreported. The quarantine, which applies to all members of the family, is expected to last 14 days after the patient has stopped showing any symptoms of COVID-19. Page added: 'The way the family has reacted to this situation is really a tale of two reactions and a study of how people should and should not react to the coronavirus. 'The patient had conducted herself responsibly and maturely, and she is to be commended for complying with the health department’s instructions.' Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School is urging students and parents who attended the dance on Saturday to seek medical treatment and to notify the school if they begin to display any symptoms of the virus. Villa Duchesne, an independent Catholic school, also notified parents on Sunday that a decision had been made to 'cancel classes and any activities' on Monday so they can 'gather information and guidance from health officials.' In a statement, the school said: 'The health and safety of our students, staff and their families will always be our top priority. 'With that in mind, we have made the decision to cancel classes and any activities at Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School tomorrow – March 9. We will use the day to gather information and guidance from health officials. 'We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this situation. We are taking this important step out of an abundance of caution. 'We will communicate more information to all of our families via email as early as possible on Monday.' It added it was 'communicating with the St. Louis County Department of Public Health' after learning that a woman 'who has received a positive test for COVID-19 is the older sister of aVilla Duchesne student.' Alice Dickherber, Director of Communications and Marketing, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:'We are communicating with the St. Louis County Department of Public Health and sharing everything that we know with them. 'We will work with officials to ensure we are doing everything possible to mitigate risk and to maintain our safe environment. 'We are committed to the health and safety of our community and we will follow the guidance of public health officials as we plan for the coming days.' The coronavirus patient, a woman in her 20s, is said to have returned from Italy and landed atChicago O'Hare International Airport on Monday, Fox News reported. She then stayed with a friend in the area before travelling to St Louis byAmtrak. A spokesman for Page added: 'Amtrak is notifying passengers and employees who may have been on the same train, and as a precaution, we have taken the train out of service for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection, and are also working to do a thorough disinfection of the Chicago and St. Louis stations.'",real
"Top economic advisors are planning to present economic options to President Donald Trump for how to steady financial markets and short up the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak when he gets back to Washington from a campaign fundraiser. Trump, who attended a fundraiser Friday night at his Mar-a-Lago property and visited his golf course over the weekend, is set to return to Washington Monday afternoon. First he had a fundraiser in a gated community in Orlando. At the top of the list of economic proposals is paid sick leave. The virus outbreak, now being called a pandemic, has exposed how sick workers can put others at risk when they show up at the office to avoid losing pay. Uber and Lyft are taking steps to make sure their workers get paid if sidelined due to the coronavirus. CNBC reported other ideas for economic stimulus would be included, with a full men of options. Officials have also been discussing ways to provide additional help on an emergency basis for small business owners. An $8.3 billion new coronavirus law the president signed Friday contains funds to help small businesses. Trump's Orlando funder was at the home of Bob Dello Russo, 69, and Dianne Russo. Guests paid up to $100,000 per couple for a roundtable, photo and reception. The event was expected to bank up to $3 million for Trump's reelection effort. Dello Russo runs an HVAC company. The home where Trump made his pitch for campaign cash inside a large tent measures 27,000 square feet and is located inside a gated community. It is fronted by two large palm trees and features a tall stone fountain surrounded by carved life-sized geese. Pool reporters traveling with the president were prevented from taking a gander at happenings inside. Press members were held in a large garage attached to a rec room with a golf simulator. Staff prohibited them from taking pictures of the location where they were being held. Trump flew back to Washington on Air Force One accompanied by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who was criticized for wearing a large gas mask on the floor of the House when voting on an $8.3 billion spending bill responding to the health emergency. The Trump administration elected not to bring out prominent financial advisor as financial markets tanked Monday morning amid coronavirus fears and moves in the oil markets. Trump himself, who has trumpeted stock market gains throughout his tenure, didn't respond to questions about the dive as he flew from West Palm Beach to Orlando for a campaign fundraising event. Nor did the administration send out top economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who on Friday spoke to four financial markets amid concerns about the coronavirus. 'Long-term investors should think seriously about buying these dips,' Kudlow told CNBC Friday morning. Kudlow, whoheads the National Economic Council, also encouraged people to buy the dip in the down market in a Feb. 25th interview with the Washington Post. Kudlow told the Fox Business Network Friday: 'Long term investors should think about going back into the stock market because there’s a lot cheaper price.' Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters the markets have 'obviously been very active today.' 'The fundamentals in this economy are unbelievable,' the former drug company exec said. He said Trump was leading a 'whole of government response,' adding, 'that is his number one concern.' He refused to take questions, pointing to a Mike Pence coronavirus briefing set for 5:30 pm. 'I'll see you all later today I'm sure,' Azar said. Trump claimed that the market trends are 'good' for consumers as the U.S. Dow drops 7 per cent when markets opened Monday morning. 'Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!' Trump tweeted Monday. 'Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,' Trump continued in another tweet Monday morning. 'That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!' White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared on Fox News Monday morning, where she accused politicians and the media of politicizing the disease outbreak. 'You know, I've said this before and the president's said this before as well. I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using this as a tool to politicize things and to scare people. It's not responsible. This is not the time for this,' she said. 'People need to be looking to the [Centers for Disease Control] for guidance. People need to be, again, washing their hands, treating this like a flu, making responsible choices. This is absolutely not the time to be trying to scare people to gain political points or to get headlines,' she said. Trump visited the CDC Friday, where he spoke about the virus and wove in statements about impeachment and his phone call to the president of Ukraine while wearing a 'Make America Great' baseball hat.

"Face reality as it is, not as it was, or as you would wish it to be,' said the late, great business tycoon Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric into one of the world's most successful firms. Welch sadly died last week, and his long-time friend Donald Trump paid fulsome tribute to him: 'There was no corporate leader like 'Neutron Jack', he tweeted. 'He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together.' Today, the President needs to heed his wise friend's advice. Fast. The coronavirus crisis engulfing the entire planet at breakneck speed is a very serious threat to human life, and nobody, not even the finest scientific brains, are quite sure how bad things will get. That's why we're seeing worst hit countries like China and Italy desperately locking down entire cities to try to get on top of it, oil prices collapsing, and stock markets crashing to levels not seen since 9/11 and the global financial meltdown of 2008/2009. In such moments of catastrophe, world leaders are made or broken. Decisions they make either cement or destroy their future legacies. This especially applies to US presidents. George W. Bush, for one, will be forever stained by his appallingly tone-deaf response to Hurricane Katrina. And Jimmy Carter was voted out of office for failing to rescue American hostages in Iran. Conversely, John F Kennedy remains revered for staring down the Soviet Union during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. And Harry S. Truman is hugely admired for his decisive leadership to end World War 2. Yet President Trump seems hell-bent on pursuing a very self-destructive course when it comes to handling the biggest test of his presidency, and it's one that could see him get kicked out of the White House in November if he doesn't stop it. As with Carter's one-term demise, it won't be because Americans blame him for causing the crisis, but because they ultimately blame him for the way he dealt with it. And right now, he is dealing with it very badly. The most important thing for any president to do when a crisis like this begins to kill Americans is to impart accurate information to the public that matches up to whatever the country's chief medical experts are saying. And to remain calm, focused and avoid any hyperbolic rhetoric, good or bad, that might cause unnecessary public panic. President Trump has done none of these things. Instead, he's spent the past two weeks dismissing coronavirus as a nothing-burger, insisting the US has it completely under control, contradicting expert advice, and telling us all why he's a medical genius whose 'hunch' is that there's nothing to worry about. Well sorry, Mr President, but this isn't a time for your hunches or demonstrably false statements. This is a time for cold, hard, medical facts and scientific evidence. On Friday, Trump stated that 'anyone who wants a test can have a test'. Yet his own Vice-President Mike Pence, who is overseeing the White House coronavirus response, admitted just hours earlier: 'We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate the demand going forward.' 'Things change in a crisis, the advice may change in a crisis,' Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told the New York Times. 'And so it's really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice.' How are Americans supposed to have any confidence when the President says one thing and his deputy says another? The need for speedy testing is absolutely essential in fighting coronavirus, as it can focus attention on where it's needed. Yet the Times also reported the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched its first effort at a diagnostic test kit, causing a significant delay, and then severely limited supply by imposing very narrow criteria. As a result, when the first American cases began to appear, very few people were able to be tested. Indeed, the first US resident to contract the virus through community contact, in California, didn't get tested for four days after entering hospital even though doctors had requested a test. As of this weekend, only 5,860 public samples had actually been tested, which is a staggeringly, shamefully low number for a superpower of 325 million people that's had three months to prepare since news of COV-19 emerged. By contrast, China has tested millions and South Korea is testing 10,000 people a day. Now the fear is that the coronavirus genie is out of the bottle in the U.S. and has been silently sweeping through communities in victims showing no symptoms, or through those who do but can't get tested, ready to erupt as it has in Italy these past few days to devastating effect. And if that is the case then all the subsequent testing can do is offer a clearer idea of infection rates rather than enable officials to stop the outbreak in its tracks. President Trump seems either in deliberate denial about this, or genuinely oblivious to the reality of what is happening. As other countries race to shut down sports events, movie theaters, restaurants, public transport and other places where large gatherings amass, America continues to hide its head in the sand, hoping this will all blow over. It won't. It's going to get a lot worse, very quickly. This morning, Trump went on an angry defensive self-congratulatory tweet-storm, boasting about how well he is handling the crisis, and attacking 'fake news media and their partner the Democrat Party' for 'doing everything within its semi-considerable power to inflame the Coronavirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant.' He then quoted Surgeon General as saying, 'The risk is low to the average American.' That last claim is probably true. For most people under 50, in good health, it appears to be a relatively low risk virus. But the risk for elderly and infirm people is extremely high, and the speed of infection of COD-19 - way faster than normal flu - and deadly severity of its impact on people in those group- far worse than normal flu - are genuinely scary. In Italy alone, it has now infected almost as many people as SARS infected worldwide in its entirety, infections are rocketing higher every day, and the mortality rate is running at nearly 5 percent. If the same thing happens in the U.S. then hundreds of thousands of Americans will die. This eventuality would make Trump's 'there's nothing to worry about' rebound savagely and perhaps unforgivably in his political face. (Ironically, Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China – which is what Trump boasts of doing in America to great effect – and yet it's suffered the worst outbreak in Europe.) It doesn't take even a stable genius to work out why Trump is maintaining this 'nothing to see here' stance. If coronavirus runs riot through America, and the economy, his biggest success story, continues to implode, then the President knows he could face the vengeful wrath of voters at the ballot box. Even his die-hard base may drop their unwavering support if their relatives start dying and their business go bust. So, the stakes are potentially very high for President Trump. That's why he was even reluctant to let Americans off a cruise ship in San Francisco into quarantine, despite the risk to their health aboard a vessel with 21 confirmed cases of the virus - because he said he didn't want the number of reported US infections to rise. Seriously, Mr President? These people are not just 'numbers' – they're American citizens who have an absolute right to be back on U.S. soil. To be perfectly frank, I don't care right now about what coronavirus means for Trump politically. I care about coronavirus means for public health. And the President's normal swaggering, loose-tongued, fact-challenged, wise-cracking style of leadership just doesn't work on something as serious as this. On Friday, during his weird and woeful press conference, he boasted about having a 'supergenius' scientist uncle at MIT, and then said: 'I like this stuff, I really get it, people are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability?' No offence, Mr President, but everything you're been saying about COD-19 to date suggests you have absolutely no idea what the hell you're dealing with. As your friend Jack Welch said, face reality as it is, not what you want it to be. I strongly suggest you stop your absurdly premature victory tour, leave the expert talk to the experts and start taking coronavirus a lot more seriously, before it's too late - for Americans, and for your presidency.

"Twitter says it's reached an investment deal with Silver Lake and Elliott Management that will keep Jack Dorsey as CEO. The social media company announced the deal on Monday, giving Elliott a seat on the board just over a week after the activist hedge fund pushed for Dorsey's removal. Under the deal, private equity firm Silver Lake will invest $1billion in Twitter and also get a board seat. Twitter said it would use the investment and its own cash to fund a $2billion stock buyback. Elliott and its billionaire founder billionaire Paul Singer acquired a $1billion stake in Twitter on February 28 and launched a campaign to remove Dorsey after the CEO announced last fall that he would be moving to Africa in mid-2020. Among Singer's concerns about Dorsey was his divided attention between his roles at Twitter and Square, the payments company he co-founded. Investors also raised concerns over how Dorsey would run both companies if he was to move to Africa for half a year. Elliott, which owns about four percent of Twitter's stock, was planningto nominate four people to its eight-member board when three of the company's directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, sources told Reuters last month. The new deal with Silver Lake appears to have quashed the threat of Dorsey's removal. It does not specifically mention changes to his role. Twitter on Monday said its board has formed a committee to evaluate its leadership structure, CEO succession plan and share the results publicly before the end of the year. 'As a Board, we regularly review and evaluate how Twitter is run, and while our CEO structure is unique, so is Jack and so is this company,' said Patrick Pichette, lead independent director of Twitter's board. Silver co-CEO and managing partner Egon Durban and Elliott partner Jesse Cohn will join the board as Twitter continues to search for a third new independent director with expertise in technology and artificial intelligence, according to Pichette. According to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, Elliott and Silver will not 'comment on or influence, or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly, any Twitter policies or rules, or policy or rule enforcement decisions, related to the Twitter platform'. Shares of Twitter were down about six percent during premarket trading but surged following news of the deal. Twitter is one of the few US technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about two percent of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott. Dorsey is the only CEO to lead two public companies with market valuations greater than $5billion. The investment deal came just days after Dorsey said he is re-evaluating his decision to move to Africa in light of thecoronavirus threat and 'everything else going on'. Dorsey tweeted in November, as he was wrapping up a tour of the continent, that he was planning to move there for three to six months in mid-2020. 'Sad to be leaving the continent…for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I'll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020,' he wrote. He backtracked on the move while speaking ata Q&A session at Morgan Stanley's Tech, Media and Telecom Conference last Thursday, blamingthe global uncertainty about the spread of the coronavirus for his step back and claiming that he would still consider it in the future when he was able to give more context. 'When I tweeted about my intention to spend a few months in Africa this year, I made a mistake and should have provided more context about why,' said a comment from Dorsey via the Twitter Investor Relations account. 'Africa will be one of the most populated continents in the next 20-30 yrs, the tech innovation is incredible w/ a large portion of the population still coming onto the internet. Huge opportunity especially for young people to join Twitter + for us to learn to best serve them. 'I had been working on my plans where I'd work decentralized, as my team and I do when we travel, but in light of COVID-19 and everything else going on I need to reevaluate. Either way we'll continue to pursue opportunities in Africa.' Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 and left in 2013 to found Square following a series of corporate shake-ups and rumors of leadership turmoil. Since he returned to Twitter in 2015, the company's shares have turned by 6.2 percent. Investors have remained uncertain about the CEO and concerns reached a fever pitch late last month when Singer took a $1billion stake in Twitter. Singer, a Republican mega-donor, was reportedly planning to use his newfound influence to push for many changes, starting at the top by nominatingfour directors, including two people from his New York-based hedge fund. According to insiders cited by Bloomberg, Singer's main grievance was that Dorsey splits his time as CEO of Twitter and CEO as Square Inc, his mobile payments app from which he derives the majority of his reported $5billion fortune. Singer believes Dorsey's undivided attention should be devoted to Twitter, especially given the looming 2020 election and other global news events which the company has a role in spreading information about. He is also a staunch Trump supporter. While his views on Dorsey's politics are not known, many Republican pundits or activists have criticized the Twitter CEO for banning political ads or even banning them when they share conservative content on the site. After Singer's announcement Twitter shares jumped by seven percent to $35.75 on March 3, three percent more than they had all year. It boosted the company's overall value by $1billion to slightly over $28billion. But while the market responded keenly to the news, Twitter employees revolted against it. They started tweeting their support of Dorsey with the hashtag '#WeBackJack' and even Elon Musk, the eccentric founder of Tesla whose own presence on Twitter has caused problems for his company, shared his support. 'Just want say that I support @jack as Twitter CEO. He has a good [heart],' Musk tweeted, using a red love heart emoji. Twitter executives met with Singer and his representatives in San Francisco on Friday night but Dorsey was not present for the meeting. Dorsey's claim that he was reneging on the decision because of the coronavirus came as the tech company took precautions to prevent the spread among its employees. Last week,Twitter said it was 'strongly encouraging' its staff in the US and across the world to work from home as the death toll began to reach over 100. The San Francisco-based social media giant urged its 5,000 staffers to stay away from its various offices where possible in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. There is a mandatory ban on Twitter employees coming into offices in South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. 'We are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they're able. Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus for us - and the world around us,' Twitter HR chief Jennifer Christie wrote in a blog post on Monday. 'We are operating out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy. 'We are working to make sure internal meetings, all hands, and other important tasks are optimized for remote participation. We recognize that working from home is not ideal for some job functions. For those employees who prefer or need to come into the offices, they will remain open for business.' Twitter had already announced the suspension of 'non-critical' business travel and events last week. Dorsey also said the company would no longer be appearing at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas later this month as a result of the coronavirus.",real
"Harvey Weinstein is being treated for concussion after falling and hitting his head in prison, it has been reported. The disgraced film producer is caged in adorm-style cell in New York's notorious Rikers Island prison with two other inmates, a source claimed yesterday. Weinstein - who is said to have been 'miserable' ever since arriving at the jail - has been treated for the fall. The 67-year-old will be sentenced for two sex crimes on Wednesday and is said to have been been 'humbled' by his incarceration for sex crimes. His spokesperson Juda Engelmayer told Page Six:'He's miserable but trying to be optimistic as best he can. He has had a lot of time to think about his life and be humbled, but he thinks it's going to be a long, uphill battle from here.' He added that adjusting to jail life has been especially difficult without the aid of his walker. On Saturday night, Weinstein fell over after trying to walk on his own. 'He fell on his head and thinks he has a concussion,' Engelmayer said. 'His head has been pounding since yesterday.' Details of his supposed prison set-up were disclosed following reports in the US that he was given his own wing at the prison, which is so grim it is being shut down by New York City in 2026. The disgraced movie mogul is housed in the North Infirmary Command with two 'older gentlemen,' his spokesperson added. An official at the city's Department of Corrections claimed that he was being kept isolated for fears other prisoners might attack him. The news website TMZ said he was given 24-hour security and medical care. A source close to the movie mogul said he had already had a fall that required medical attention. He had been accused of getting special treatment because after his conviction on February 24, instead of going straight to Rikers, he was taken to hospital, where he stayed for ten days. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital by ambulance immediately after being found guilty when he complained of chest pains. Weinstein had a four-hour operation to put a stent in his heart, but was deemed healthy enough to move last Friday. He was then taken from Bellevue in New York to Rikers Island. His legal team had hoped he would stay at the hospital until his sentencing. He is guilty of one count of a criminal sexual act and one count of third-degree rape and faces up to 29 years in jail. The victims were Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant, and Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress. Miss Haleyi is expected to read a victim impact statement at his sentencing. Until then, Weinstein is being kept on the sixth floor of the main building of the North Infirmary Command at Rikers – a unit for high-profile prisoners and inmates with medical issues. The source said: 'Harvey and his prison consultant say it's not true that the floor is closed down for him. He has two roommates. It's dorm style. He has the same treatment as everybody else has. 'He said that this is a very humbling and reflective time for him. 'He is being very respectful and not the same arrogant man he once was. He's not in good condition physically, he has fallen down in the jail already, and he's doing his best to stay the course.' It was not clear what crimes Weinstein's roommates have been convicted of, although Rikers includes everyone from burglars to murderers. TMZ also reported that Weinstein was under 24-hour surveillance to stop him killing himself. Prison officials fear that he may do the same as billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who hanged himself in his cell while awaiting sex trafficking charges. Weinstein was said to be monitored by cameras and frequent checks by guards. Sources told TMZ he receives medical attention for back problems, eye issues and other ailments, including after-care for his recent surgery. The Department of Corrections said Weinstein gets one hour of recreation time every day and access to the law library and religious services. His meals include healthy options, but he can request junk food. Weinstein is known for loving his sweets, and cleaned out the court's canteen of his favourite brand during the trial. On Friday prosecutors filed a memo calling for Weinstein to receive a severe sentence to reflect a 40-year career of sexual misconduct. Joan Illuzzi, the lead prosecutor, said the list of incidents shows a 'lifetime of abuse toward others, sexual and otherwise'.",real
"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle exchanged an awkward 'hello' with Prince William and Kate today as they carried out their last public royal duty before they walk away from the monarchy, at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey this afternoon. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked in ahead of Prince William and Kate Middleton - the first public meeting of the two brothers and their wives since Megxit was announced two months ago - before Prince Charles and Camilla also arrived and the Queen then made an entrance to trumpet fanfare and cheers from crowds outside. Unlike last year, Harry and Meghan were conducted to their seats at the church in London, rather than waiting for the Queen's arrival and walking through with the monarch and key royals as they did in March 2019. Once seated, the royals' position on the chairs was based on their ranks within the family, with Charles next to the Queen from being first-in-line, followed by William in second, and Harry in sixth. They took similar positions last year, although Meghan was next to Prince Andrew, who has since stepped down from royal duties. Meghan was seen to mouth 'hi' and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a 'hello', as the Cambridges took their seat in the High Altar. Harry also said 'hello' and smiled at his brother. It comes after Harry admitted last October that he and his brother are on 'different paths' and have good and bad days in their relationship. Other arrivals included Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his pregnant fiancée Carrie Symonds, Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and her daughter Bluebell, 13, and singersAlexandra Burke and Craig David, who are both performing. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his wife Laura Alvarez also arrived, along withHome Secretary Priti Patel, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg andUS AmbassadorWoody Johnson, who gave another guest an elbow bump in the wake of the coronavirus. It also emerged today that last-minute changes were made to the royal arrangements, meaning Prince William and Kate, who were due to join the Queen in the procession, were also conducted to their places. A source said the amendments were made yesterday, despite the Order of Service already having been signed off and printed.Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace have not commented on why the switch has been made. The Sussexes this year arrived after the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who were the first senior royals to walk in and were also escorted to their seats.The move signifies their impending exit from The Firm - dubbed Megxit. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America. The procession included Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, clergy, Mr Johnson and the Commonwealth Secretary General, among others. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex looked relaxed as they arrived at the Abbey to take their place in the congregation for the event. This is the awkward moment Boris Johnson extends his hand but snatches it back at the last minute as he remembers handshakes are banned amid the coronavirus crisis. Cringeworthy pictures show the Prime Minister proffering his hand to a religious leader during the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey today before sharply pulling it backwards. Mr Johnson then holds his hands up in a gesture of innocence while his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and the bishop appear to chuckle. Meanwhile, Prince Charles was spotted avoiding handshakes by giving a 'namaste' greeting. The Prince of Wales declined to shake hands with Baroness Janet Scotland, but instead pressed his palms together and gave a slight bow. As members of the Royal Family arrived they were introduced to a line of dignitaries, including Mr Johnson, but no-one shook hands as they greeted each other. It is understood the Queen and other senior royals were following the protocol the Abbey has been operating under during the past few days. Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, also figured out an alternative way to shake hands at the annual Commonwealth Service, offering another guest an elbow bump instead. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived soon after Meghan and Harry and like the Sussexes were introduced to a group of dignitaries before being shown to their seats. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall arrived at the Abbey ahead of the Queen who - as head of state - is always the final member of the congregation to arrive. Meghan was seen to mouth 'hi' and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a 'hello', as the Cambridges took their seat in the High Altar in the row in front of the Sussexes. Harry also said 'hello' and smiled at his brother. Edward partly rose to greet the Cambridges, but Sophie and the Sussexes remained seated. Meghan later chatted animatedly to Edward as they waited for the Queen to arrive, with Harry joining in the conversation and putting his arm on the back of Meghan's chair as he did so. As the members of the royal family arrived they were introduced to a line of dignitaries, including Boris Johnson, but no-one shook hands as they greeted each other. It is understood the Queen and other senior royals were following the protocol the Abbey has been operating under during the past few days due to the coronavirus outbreak. Meghan was in a green Emilia Wickstead dress with asymmetrical cape and hat by William Chambers. Kate was in red, wearing a coat by Catherine Walker and a hat by Sally-Ann Provan. The Queen wore a Stewart Parvin delicate air force blue cashmere double breasted A-line coat, with a silk faille printed shift dress in shades of 'air force blue, black and burnt orange'. Camilla wore a navy silk and lace dress and coat by Bruce Oldfield and a navy feathered hat by Philip Treacy, while Sophie was in a white and navy Suzannah dress and navy Jane Taylor hat. As the royal procession of clergy, the PM, the Queen, Charles and Camilla made its way to the altar, Kate and Sophie curtsied in sync to the Queen, while Meghan followed later with a deep curtsy for the monarch, and another for the Prince of Wales. World heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua spoke eloquently about his Nigerian and British heritage and how his background reflected many in the Commonwealth. He told the congregation: 'Like me, so many children of the Commonwealth have two homes and two identities, two cultures and two ways of viewing the world. Some have more than two. The Duchess of Sussex looked resplendent in an emerald green ensemble as she arrived for the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey this afternoon. Meghan Markle, 38, chose an exquisite caped dress by designer Emilia Wickstead with a matching hat by William Chambers as she joined husband Prince Harry , 35, and senior royals including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the engagement. It marks Harry and Meghan's last official outing as senior members of the royal family before they give up their titles at the end of the month as part of their 'Megxit' departure deal. And the Duchess of Sussex rose to the occasion with her showstopping ensemble, which was widely praised on social media by royal supporters and fashion fans alike within minutes of her arrival. The elegant, long-sleeved dress is thought to be a bespoke creation by Wickstead, a favourite of both Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge, 38. The fitted long-sleeved dress falls a few inches below the knee and features cleverly-placed darts on the torso and waistline that serve to flatter the Duchess's svelte frame. A dramatically draped asymmetric cape that falls over the right shoulder adds a fashion-forward twist to the otherwise classic cut. Continuing a recent streak of monochrome looks, Meghan wore a matching green hat with net detailing on the brim and folded in an oversized flower structure on the side. She introduced a contrasting texture with a £1,695 'Demi' satin green bag by socialite designer Gabriel Hearst, worn on previous occasions, and finished the look with a pair of nude heels by favourite footwear designer Aquazzura. When it came to jewellery, Meghan chose her beautiful diamond trio engagement ring and her trusty pair of £6,950 Stowstorm earrings by Canadian designer Birks. Meghan's brunette locks were swept up in a delicate braided bun tied beneath her hat at the nape of her neck. Her make-up consisted of dramatic, dark eyes, defined brows, bronzed cheek and a touch of rose pink lip colour. 'These days we hear so much about division and difference that some might be tempted to see that as a bad thing. 'But on the contrary, it's a beautiful thing, a thing to be celebrated and cherish, and a great source of peace and stability. 'In this world of extreme connectivity, who better to connect us and shape our common future than the children of the Commonwealth, who have a foot in two camps and desperately want to see both sides succeed.' Meghan and Harry's baby son Archie is the first mixed-race child to be born into the royal family in centuries and has been seen as a reflection of modern multi-cultural Britain. Meghan smiled and nodded along slightly to Alexandra Burke's rendition of Ain't No Mountain. Meghan later hugged the singer as they were introduced at the end of the service. As the Sussexes made their way out of the Great West Door, the duchess crouched down to chat to the children who were handing out bouquets to the royal women. Harry gave a farewell wave to some of those gathered inside the Abbey gates. As their final official duty as senior royals came to an end, the couple held hands as they walked towards their car before they were driven swiftly away. The Duchess of Sussex wore a glamorous green Emilia Wickstead dress with a dramatic asymmetrical cape for her final official royal duty. American ex-Suits actress Meghan's hat with flamboyant netting was by William Chambers. The duchess could be seen occasionally flicking the cape off her hand as she walked through Westminster Abbey with the Duke of Sussex to her seat. Followers of Meghan's fashion @MeghansMirror said the dress was bespoke Emilia Wickstead, and that the duchess was carrying an emerald green Gabriela Hearst handbag and wearing Birks Snowstorm earrings. The blogger described her as 'a vision in green', while Meghansfashion.com hailed her as 'glamorous'. Meghan continued her trend of wearing block colours. She has already worn red, white and a shade of blue - the colours of the union flag, but also those of the US star and stripes flag - on her final round of official engagements. For her carefully choreographed farewell tour, she chose a fitted turquoise blue T-shirt dress by Victoria Beckham to the Endeavour Fund Awards, and a red Safiyaa dress and cape at a military music festival, and a white organza Topshop blouse and Roland Mouret's Moka skirt for a private visit to the National Theatre. She also opted for a cream jacket, white top and black trousers for a visit to a school in Dagenham, East London. The Duchess of Cambridge was in red, wearing a coat by Catherine Walker and a hat by Sally-Ann Provan at the Commonwealth Service. Two protesters have been tackled to the ground outside Westminster Abbey today minutes before the Queen and the royal family were due to arrive for the annualCommonwealth Day service. One suspect, carrying a bunch of white roses, was grabbed by the waist and pinned to the floor by officers guarding the road outside. Another man with a large white banner was also held after apparently running from behind crash barriers into the cordoned off street and towards the Abbey. A Scotland Yard spokesman said:'As part of the policing operation for Commonwealth Day celebrations, officers arrested two menfor breach of Anti-Terrorism Road Traffic Regulations (ATTRO). Both are in police custody. An operation remains in place whilst the celebrations are ongoing.' The men are believed to have been among a group of men protesting about 'Commonwealth hypocrisy' over the treatment of people in Cameron. The Queen wore a Stewart Parvin delicate cashmere double-breasted A-line coat, with a silk faille printed shift dress in shades of 'air force blue, black and burnt orange'. The Duchess of Cornwall wore a navy silk and lace dress and coat by Bruce Oldfield and a navy feathered hat by Philip Treacy, while the Countess of Wessex was in a white and navy Suzannah dress and navy Jane Taylor hat. Meanwhile two protesters have been tackled to the ground outside Westminster Abbey today minutes before the Queen and the royal family were due to arrive for the Commonwealth Day service. One suspect, carrying a bunch of white roses, was grabbed by the waist and pinned to the floor by officers guarding the road outside. Another man with a large white banner was also held after apparently running from behind crash barriers into the cordoned off street and towards the Abbey. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'As part of the policing operation for Commonwealth Day celebrations, officers arrested two men for breach of Anti-Terrorism Road Traffic Regulations (ATTRO). 'Both are in police custody. An operation remains in place whilst the celebrations are ongoing.' The men are believed to have been among a group of men protesting about 'Commonwealth hypocrisy' over the treatment of people in Cameron. At the service last year, Harry and Meghan waited alongside William, Kate, Charles and Camilla for the Queen to arrive, before taking part in 'The Procession of The Queen'. Phil Dampier, author of Royally Suited Harry and Meghan In Their Own Words, told MailOnline: 'It's very significant that Harry and Meghan aren't in the procession but will just go to their seats. 'It emphasises that they are no longer working royals but they are still part of the family. 'The Queen has made it clear that they can't be half in and half out of royal duties. It's very poignant and sad for her because she wanted Harry and Meghan to do fantastic things for the Commonwealth. 'She wanted them to be her special ambassadors on royal trips throughout the Commonwealth which she can no longer do because of her age. The Royal Family have shared a clip of a Princess Elizabeth, aged 21, vowing to dedicate her life to the Commonwealth during her first foreign tour in South Africa in April 1947. The Queen, who would ascend the throne four years later, aged 25, after her father King George VI died in 1952, could be heard in a radio speech from Cape Town during a visit alongside the King, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret in the first state visit since 1939 and the outbreak of World War II. The monarch, now 93, would go on to undertake over 200 visits to the Commonwealth countries - which were formed in 1931 - during her reign, which has already lasted 68 years. A black and white picture of the royal shows her wearing the beloved two string pearl necklace gifted to her by her father, as she embarked on her tour abroad. And in a clip of the speech, the Queen says: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.' Sharing the post on Twitter, the Royal Family wrote: 'On her twenty-first birthday, in a speech broadcast on the radio from Cape Town, The Queen (then Princess Elizabeth) dedicated her life to the service of the Commonwealth.' 'The Commonwealth has been one of her greatest achievements and she will want it to succeed long after her death. Harry and Meghan had a wonderful future with it but have thrown it all away in my opinion.' Royal biographer Penny Junor said of today's service: 'It will be fascinating to see how it plays out. I imagine everybody will be on absolutely best behaviour. But goodness knows what they will all be thinking privately.'

Aides have said Harry and Meghan, who are retaining Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, will be in the UK regularly. But this final official appearance is a poignant milestone as they prepare to embark on their future away from the royal family. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were today reunited with Prince William and Kate for the first time in four months, and the last time before they bow out of royal duties and embrace their new life in North America. The Sussexes and Cambridges came together for the first time since they paid their respects at a Remembrance Day service in November. Meghan was seen to mouth 'hi' and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a 'hello', as the Cambridges took their seat in the High Altar in the row in front of the Sussexes. Harry also said 'hello' and smiled at his brother. But body language expert Judy James claims the siblings appeared 'awkward' with William seemingly failing to greet his younger brother. Edward partly rose to greet the Cambridges, but Sophie and the Sussexes remained seated. Meghan later chatted animatedly to Edward as they waited for the Queen to arrive, with Harry joining in the conversation and putting his arm on the back of Meghan's chair as he did so. Body language expert Judy James said: 'As they took their seats Harry threw Kate an open-mouthed smile and 'hello' of what looked like genuine pleasure and Meghan raised her brows and smiled in an equally friendly ritual. 'For William though there was a mouthed 'hello' from Meghan but a weak, mouth-closed smile from Harry and no sign that William responded. 'Prince Edward engaged Harry and Meghan in some animated conversation until Charles and the Queen arrived. 'Meghan dropped curtsies to both and smiled but Harry looked distinctly awkward as he started fiddling with his programme.' On March 31, Meghan will bow out of royal life just one year, 10 months and 12 days - or 682 days - after marrying into the family. She spent almost five years longer appearing on screen in the US drama Suits. The duchess, then Meghan Markle, starred as paralegal Rachel Zane between June 23 2011 and April 25 2018, totalling six years, 10 months and three days, or 2,499 days. The televised service at the abbey is a key annual event in the calendar for the Queen who is head of the Commonwealth. But this year's ceremony is likely to be remembered for being Harry and Meghan's royal swansong. Meghan and Harry were reunited with William and Kate for the first time in four months, and the last time before they bow out of royal duties and embrace their new life in North America. The Sussexes and Cambridges came together for the first time since they paid their respects at a Remembrance Day service in November.

'Prince Edward engaged Harry and Meghan in some animated conversation until Charles and the Queen arrived. 'Meghan dropped curtsies to both and smiled but Harry looked distinctly awkward as he started fiddling with his programme.' Their goodbye tour - a flurry of appearances in the UK - has including the Endeavour Fund Awards, a military musical festival at the Royal Albert Hall and Meghan's secret visit to a school in Dagenham, East London, to celebrate International Women's Day. The history of the Commonwealth goes back to the days of the British Empire, with leaders of semi-independent countries or Dominions attending conferences with Britain from 1887. The 1926 Imperial Conference saw Britain and the Dominions agreed that they were all equal members of a community within the Empire, which became called the Commonwealth. These Dominions and other territories of the Empire gradually became fully independent, and a meeting in 1949 agreed that republics and other countries could be part of the Commonwealth. This saw the modern Commonwealth formed. King George VI was the first Head of the Commonwealth, and Queen Elizabeth II took over when he died. Independent countries from Africa, North and South Americas, Asia, Europe and the Pacific have joined the Commonwealth since 1949. But the last two countries to join - Rwanda and Mozambique - have no historical ties to the Empire. The Commonwealth Service will also be the first time the duke and duchess have appeared with the royal family since their bombshell 'Megxit' announcement in January. Tradition dictates that Harry, who is not a future king, sits with Meghan in the second row of seats behind the Queen, Charles, Camilla, William and Kate during the service. The duke and duchess were pictured standing alongside William and Kate in the gothic abbey last year when Meghan was pregnant with Archie. All eyes will be on how the couples interact at this year's ceremony. William and Harry have faced a turbulent time following a rift that began ahead of Harry's wedding to Meghan. Harry said in an ITV documentary filmed during his Africa tour that he and his brother are on 'different paths' and have good and bad days in their relationship. The Duke of York was at the service in 2019, accompanying the Queen as she arrived. But he was absent this year, having stepped down from public life following his disastrous Newsnight appearance over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Harry and Meghan last appeared alongside the royals four months ago on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph in November. Coverage of the service was broadcast live on BBC One from 2.15pm, and across the BBC World Service. - What will happen on March 31?'Megxit Day' is the day Harry and Meghan cease to be senior royals as they walk away from the monarchy. They will stop using their HRH styles. No documents will be signed or laws passed and the decision will not be binding, but it marks a new phase in their life. - Will they carry out any more royal duties?No. The couple are quitting, not just as senior royals, but as working royals in general. - Was this want they wanted?Not quite. Harry and Meghan wanted to step down as senior royals but have dual role, supporting the Queen and earning their own money. - But this was unworkable?Yes. They effectively could not have their cake and eat it. It was too controversial given their global profiles and would have led to accusations they were cashing in on their royal status. - How did the Queen sort out the saga?The monarch held a crisis summit at Sandringham with Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge - and it was announced a few days later there would be no dual role for the Sussexes. - Why did Harry and Meghan's plans cause such shock waves?Harry and Meghan issued a bombshell statement on January 8, without warning the Queen, and after being told by the monarch to discuss matters with the Prince of Wales first. - Why did they want to step down as senior royals?The couple spoke of their struggles dealing with royal life and the intense tabloid interest in a television documentary about their Africa tour. Meghan said: 'It's not enough to just survive something, that's not the point of life. You have got to thrive.' Harry has since said he wanted his family to have a 'more peaceful life'. - What were the low points following their wedding?Controversies included rows over privacy and use of private jets, a falling out between Harry and William, the launch of legal action and an attack on the press which overshadowed an official royal tour. - Where will they live?Harry and Meghan and their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor will mostly be based in North America.They are renting in Canada, so may buy a property there, or perhaps relocate to the US - Meghan's mother lives in California. - What about Frogmore Cottage?Harry and Meghan will keep their Windsor home, start paying commercial rent, and pay back £2.4 million in taxpayers' money spent on its renovations. - What will they be called?Initially the palace said they would be Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. But it was pointed out the titles mirrored those of a divorcee - the Princess of Wales became Diana, Princess of Wales following the end of her marriage to Charles. They will be the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - but without their HRHs. - Who had a similar title?Wallis Simpson - the last American divorcee to marry a senior royal, for whom Edward VIII abdicated the throne. Mrs Simpson became the Duchess of Windsor, but was never permitted to be an HRH. - Have they been stripped of their HRHs like Diana?No. Harry was born a prince and remains so. They will retain their HRHs but will not use them. - How will they make money?They are predicted to make millions from public speaking, lucrative contracts, book deals - or perhaps for Meghan, a return to acting. - Will they be financially independent?Not completely. The Prince of Wales will also continue to offer private financial support to the couple.This is expected to come from his £21 million a year Duchy of Cornwall income. - Will they launch their own charitable foundation?Yes but they are not calling it a foundation. Harry and Meghan intend to 'develop a new way to effect change' with a non-profit organisation. - Will they still be able to use Sussex Royal as their brand?No. The Queen and her senior officials are said to have declared they must drop the use of the word 'Royal'. - Are Harry and Meghan happy about this?They don't appear to be. Their website states they will not use 'Royal' but argues that the monarchy has no jurisdiction over the use of the word 'Royal' overseas. - What will their new brand name be? It has not been announced. They will have to change their @SussexRoyal Instagram handle. Some options are already taken - H&M is already a major clothing retailer. - Who will pay for their security?It's unclear which is causing controversy. It is feared the cost will fall to the taxpayer, but it could be the Sussexes themselves, the Queen or the Prince of Wales may have to pay. Neither Buckingham Palace nor the Home Office will confirm details, but the bill is estimated to be as much as £20 million a year. It won't be Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it will stop providing protection after Megxit. - What do Harry and Meghan say?Their website claims it is agreed they 'require effective security to protect them' because Harry was 'born into the royal family' and because Meghan has her 'own independent profile'. - What about their patronages?They will keep their royal patronages as private patronages and associations. But Harry's military appointments will be put on hold for the next 12 months. - What about their Commonwealth roles?Harry is quitting his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador. But he will remain president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, and Meghan will still be the Trust's vice-president. - Where will Archie go to school?As Archie will be spending most of his time in North America, it it is likely he will not have a British education, but nothing has been confirmed. - What about Meghan's citizenship?At the time of their engagement, it was announced that Meghan would be applying for British citizenship. It is not known what stage the process was at or what will happen now. - Will they been seen again in the UK?Harry is expected - in a non-royal capacity - to be at the London Marathon in April if it goes ahead. - Is this end of Harry and Meghan's royal roles forever?Possibly not. The situation will be reviewed by the monarchy in 12 months' time, leaving the door open in case of a change of heart. The Queen has told Harry the couple are much loved by the royals and would welcomed back if they wanted as working royals in the future. - Is Harry still in the line of succession?Yes, he remains sixth in line and Archie is seventh in line. The Queen in her Commonwealth Day message has praised the diversity of the family of nations whose blend of traditions 'serves to make us stronger'. In her annual message, the head of state highlighted how global connectivity makes people aware their 'choices and actions' can affect the 'well-being of people and communities living far away' - and inspires many to be more careful with natural resources. International boxing champion and Olympic gold medallist Anthony Joshua delivered a reflection, while singers Alexandra Burke sang Ain't No Mountain and Craig David performed Unbelievable. Ahead of their wedding, Harry and Meghan highlighted the Commonwealth as a priority for their royal duties. Harry said: 'Both of us have passions for wanting to make change, change for good, and with lots of young people running around the Commonwealth, that's where we're going to spend most of our time hopefully.' Stepping down as a working royal means Harry must leave his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador. But he will remain president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust and Meghan will still be the Trust's vice-president. Yesterday, the Duchess of Sussex met the Queen for the first time since she and Harry announced they are to quit as senior royals. Meghan and Harry attended a church service in Windsor with Her Majesty as they prepare to leave the royal household in a little over three weeks. He smiled and appeared relaxed as he drove Meghan to the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park. It was the first time that the duchess has seen the Queen since the couple dramatically announced on January 6 that they would be retiring from public life. While Harry has sat down with the Queen on several occasions since, Meghan has stayed in Canada with their son Archie. But any hopes that she may have had of seeing her great-grandson were dashed because Archie remains on Vancouver Island. On Saturday night, Harry appeared close to tears as he received a long round of applause during his final engagement as Captain General of the Royal Marines. In a red ceremonial uniform, he seemed to bite his lip when he and Meghan received a standing ovation as they took their seats in the royal box at the Royal Albert Hall. The couple were attending the Mountbatten Festival of Music, marking the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, as well as the 80th anniversary of the formation of Britain's commandos. The Sussexes are expected to return to Canada next week, and their new life away from royal duties will officially start on April 1. Harry will remain sixth in line to the throne, despite stepping down as a senior royal. Meanwhile the 16-year-old schoolboy who got a hug from the Duchess of Sussex after telling a deli",real

'Prince Edward engaged Harry and Meghan in some animated conversation until Charles and the Queen arrived. 'Meghan dropped curtsies to both and smiled but Harry looked distinctly awkward as he started fiddling with his programme.' The two couples were reunited for the first time since Harry and Meghan returned from Canada, where they have been staying with baby Archie. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked in ahead of Prince William and Kate Middleton - the first public meeting of the two brothers and their wives since Megxit was announced two months ago - before Prince Charles and Camilla also arrived and the Queen then made an entrance to trumpet fanfare and cheers from crowds outside. Ms James added: 'The tension appeared to grow in Harry’s signals after William took his seat in front of him. 'While Meghan curtsied and flashed a friendly, warm smile of greeting to Charles and the Queen, Harry appeared to be fiddling with his programme and later he appeared to be tapping his programme on his knee during the actual service. 'His facial expression looked distant and his accelerated blinking even suggested he might have been fighting back tears sitting behind the backs of the heads of all the family members he would be saying goodbye to. 'Harry’s jacket-pulling gesture of tension increased once the service was over and he stood behind the Cambridge’s to say goodbye to his hosts. 'Meghan touched him on the arm in what looked like a gesture of affection and steering but once William and Kate had driven away we did seem to see a different Harry altogether. 'Laughing and joking with the people outside, Harry’s relief looked so tangible that his sudden eyes to heaven and raised hands looked awfully like a signal of thanks. 'He became animated and far more relaxed and holding Meghan’s hand again he looked like a man who felt he’s got the most difficult moments over and who could now return to being ‘Just Harry’ again with his wife and son.' Last year, Harry and Meghan waited alongside William, Kate, Charles and Camilla for the Queen to arrive, before taking part in 'The Procession of The Queen'. This year, however, neither couple took part in the procession and simply made their way to their seats after greeting dignitaries. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America.",real
"Royal fans have gone into meltdown after spotting that Julia Roberts liked an Instagram picture of Meghan Markle in a dress resembling the red gown she wore in Pretty Woman. The Duchess of Sussex, 38, wore a vibrant £1,295 scarlet dress by Safiyaa at the Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday, one of the last engagements for the Duchess and Prince Harry as working royals. And eagle-eyed Twitter userRoyal Suitorpointed out that Meghan's dress had a striking resemblance to the red off-the-shoulder column dress worn by Julia Roberts, now 52, in 1990 romantic comedy. The account also noticed that Julia herself, who played prostitute Vivienne in the classic movie, liked a photo of Meghan's dress posted on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's official Instagram account. Sharing a picture of the two dresses alongside each other, the account wrote: 'The feeling when game recognises game!' Fans quickly commented on the similarity of the two gowns, with one writing: 'Julia Roberts liked the photo, came to serve looks like she did in Pretty Woman.' 'There are some photos of Meghan where she sorta has the same profile as Julia Roberts', said another, while a fellow commenter added:'Exactly what I was thinking.' This isn't the first time Meghan has paid tribute to the star. In 2017 the former Suits actor listed the Oscar winner as one of her top ten inspirational women, revealing it was Julia who inspired her own acting career. Penning a list forGlamourof ten women who changed her life, Meghan revealed that Roberts was the 'first person' to influence her acting career, andthought it was the 'best compliment of all time' when she was compared to the star. 'She was the first person I saw onscreen and thought, ""That looks like so much fun; I wanna do that"",' wrote Meghan. She added: 'When I was younger, someone once told me, ""You kind of look like Julia Roberts in profile"". It was the best compliment of all time.' Later, Roberts reacted to the news, insisting to People magazine that she was 'floating' after hearing the news that she inspired Meghan. Julia's original sculptural gown worn in Pretty Woman was designed by film costumer Marilyn Vance, featured asweetheart v-neck necklineand was paired with long white gloves. The film followsdown-on-her-luck Hollywood sex worker Vivian who meetswealthy businessman Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) and forms a long-term relationship with him following aweek-long stay with him forseveral business and social functions.

"A British guest on MSNBC Live has sparked outrage after saying 'many people' consider Meghan Markle to be 'five clicks up from trailer trash'. The show's anchor, Lindsey Reiser, ended the interview about Prince Harry and Meghan stepping back from royal duties immediately following the remark from British reporter Victoria Mather. The comment from the journalist - who has worked for The Telegraph and Vanity Fair - came as she was discussing how the Duchess of Sussex has been 'disrespectful' to the royal family and its protocol. 'I think what has really, really upset the British public is that Meghan Markle, who many people consider as only, you know, five clicks up from trailer trash, has actually tried to disrespect the queen,' she said. 'And the queen is the most respected person, most respected woman, in the world.' The comment has sparked outrage since the video went viral, with many saying remarks like Mather's are the exact reason the royal couple decided to distance themselves from the royal establishment. Mather was heavily criticized throughout the day, with Twitter users calling her comments 'racist' and 'disgusting.' In the five-minute interview that preceded the shocking commentMather said that 'Hollywood celebrity' Meghan didn't want to stay in the royal family because she would be 'second-best' to her sister-in-law Kate Middleton. She also claimed that Meghan had given Kate a knife for Christmas. She said: 'I don't think Meghan Markle wanted to spend the rest of her life looking at Kate Middleton's back as she sat in the second row to the future queen. I don't think she wanted — she didn't want to be second best. 'I do hear that she gave Kate a knife for Christmas,' Mather added, as she was laughing. 'Which is quite something, isn't it?' Anchor Lindsey Reiser ended the interview immediately following the 'trailer trash' remark, adding thatMSNBC 'had not confirmed what [Mather] had mentioned about knife gifting.' Mather was incorrectly identified on the show as a 'Vanity Fair Royals Watcher,' by the presenter but did not correct her. Although Mather currently writes for the digital news platform Air Mail, she identifies herself by her former title as a travel editor for Vanity Fair on her social media profiles. A spokesperson for Condé Nast, the magazine's parent company, told BuzzFeed Newsthat she has not been employed there since 2018. The duke and duchess returned to the UK this week to complete their final official royal duties after moving to Canada. On Saturday, they attended the Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Today the couple will take part in their last official engagement before they step down as working royals at the end of this month. They will stand alongside the Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William and Kate, at the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey. On Sunday Harry and Meghan joined the Queen for a church service in Windsor. It was the first time that Meghan, 38, and the Queen, 93, have seen each other since the bombshell announcement on January 6.",real
"Kim Jong Un has fired three short-range missiles 125 miles across its east coast and into the waters between North Korea and Japan - just two days after threatening 'momentous' action, South Korea's military say. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) revealed multiple kinds of projectiles were fired from the eastern coastal town of Sondok before rising up to 30 miles today. The missiles come just two days after the Korean peninsula threatened to take 'momentous' action in protest against outside condemnation over its live-fire exercises. It is the second set of weapons testing by Pyongyang in the last 10 days, following a four-month break. A JCS statement said South Korea felt 'strong regret' over the launches because they violated a 2018 inter-Korean agreement which aimed to lower military tensions. South Korea's national security director Chung Eui-yong, defense ministerJeong Kyeong-dooand spy chiefSuh Hoon have agreed the action was not helpful in establishing peace, according to South Korea's presidential Blue House. They held an emergency video conference to discuss the missiles' launch. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga confirmed North Korea had fired suspected ballistic missiles. He added that the multiple North Korean projectiles traveled between 62 to 125 miles but none landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone. 'North Korea's latest action, on top of its repeated firings of ballistic missiles, is a serious threat to the peace and safety of Japan and a grave problem for the entire international society,' Suga said. The South Korean Defense Ministry told CNN the launches could be 'joint strike drills that include multiple types of multiple rocket launchers' as part of Pyongyang's winter military drills. In the past 10 days, North Korea has said leader Kim Jong Un supervised two rounds of live-fire artillery exercises in its first weapons tests since late November. Kim had entered the new year with a vow to bolster his nuclear deterrent and not to be bound by a major weapons test moratorium. It comes amid a deadlock in a US-led diplomacy aimed at convincing Kim to abandon his nuclear program in return for economic and political benefits. South Korea and some European countries protested against the second North Korea drills on March 2, which they believe involved ballistic missile launches in a violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Pyongyang fired two unidentified short-range projectiles from an area near the coastal city of Wonsan, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Sondok, last Monday. North Korea insists it has the right to conduct military drills in the face of US and South Korean forces on its doorstep. The UN Security Council didn't issue any statement after discussing North Korea's March 2 drills, but five European members condemned what they called 'provocative actions.' Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom said the tests undermine regional and international peace, security and stability. The North's Foreign Ministry accused the five European countries of 'repeating an absurd argument of condemnation and violation resolutions of the UN whenever we conducted military drills' on Saturday. 'The reckless behavior of these countries instigated by the US will become a fuse that trigger our yet another momentous reaction,' a ministry statement said. Last week, Kim Jong Un's younger sister leveled a verbal attack against South Korea for criticizing its earlier live-fire exercises. Her statement was then followed by Kim sending a letter to South Korean President Moon Jae-in expressing condolences over its coronavirus outbreak. Some experts say North Korea may intend to catch South Korea off balance before seeking help in reviving its economy, since the US has said sanctions on North Korea will stay in place unless it takes significant steps toward denuclearization. 'The coronavirus is likely exceeding North Korea's public health capacity, so Kim Jong Un is playing a two-level game,' said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor at Seoul's Ewha Womans University. 'At the domestic level, his regime claims to protect the people with drastic quarantine measures and military exercises against external threats. 'Pyongyang may be seeking international assistance, but remains obsessed with not appearing in an inferior position to Seoul.' Nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington remain stalled since the breakdown of a second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in Vietnam in early 2019. Subsequent talks between the two countries failed to produce progress amid disputes over how much sanctions relief should be given in return for a limited step away from nuclear weapons by North Korea.",real
"Katy Perry has revealed her grandmother Ann Pearl Hudson has passed away aged 99. The singer, 35, broke the news on Twitter on Monday morning, just days after she announced she was expecting her first child with actor fiancé Orlando Bloom, 43. Sharing a link to a choral version of Deep Peace, she wrote: 'a song for Grandma. May she rest in deep peace. Ann Pearl Hudson'. The Roar-hitmaker's loyal fans were quick to express their love and deepest sympathies following the sad revelation. A Katy fan account first shared the tragic news on Sunday night, with others following suit. They wrote: 'BREAKING: Katy Perry’s grandma has sadly passed away at the age of 99. You will forever be missed by the KatyCats. #RIPGrandmaAnn'. Katy later took to Instagram to share a moving message in tribute to her 'fighter' grandmother. She posted: 'I don’t know when a soul enters a new vehicle but if there is an afterlife where there’s a waiting room of the coming and going my mind wonders if the soul that is waiting to come into my world is getting a kiss on the forehead from my sweet Grandma that departed this earth yesterday. My heart hopes so. 'If she is able to speak with the soul in waiting the conversation would probably include “are sure you wanna pick this wild group?!” There would be most definitely be some sarcasm, a witty quip or two... 'tbh grandma probably had a glass of her favorite blush wine ready upon arrival to this afterlife... and a most fashionable look, jewels included, naturally. 'A lot of what I am is because of my father... and he is because of her. She started it all, as she used to remind us and I’m so grateful she did. 'Family... is there to show us what love can be... sometimes that journey of finding the love is tough to get to AND through but if you can open your heart and let the light lead the way you will find that incomparable love. 'Ann Pearl Hudson was a fighter. She survived the Great Depression, raised 3 kids on her own as a seamstress, making G strings for showgirls and other such characters in Vegas. 'She was always authentically herself, funny and full of all the sweet cozy things you think of when you think of grandmas. 'She gave me crisp dollar bills in hallmark cards, she let us eat her favorite almond cookies from the 99 cent store while we asked questions about the different fans she had on display on her walls. 'She was a great grandma and I will forever carry some of her in me. 'When my whit comes out, that’s Ann. When my authenticity comes out, that’s Ann. When my stubbornness comes out, hell, that’s Ann. When my fighter spirit comes out, that’s Ann. When my style comes out, that’s Ann. 'May she rest in deep peace and kiss the forehead of the soul to come and let them know everything is gonna be OK, especially now that they have gained an angel to look over them.' The star's sassy grandmother became extremely popular with fans after appearing in her 3D concert film Part Of Me. She had earned a legion of admirers for her quick witted replies and sarcastic sense of humour displayed in the fly-on-the-wall tour documentary. Quizzed what Katy was like growing up, Ann replied, 'A show-off... an attention-getter!' Recalling the star's younger years, her grandma memorably joked: 'I remember I went one time to babysit and I had to keep them for the weekend. It was awful.' Katy also regularly took her beloved grandmother along to awards shows as her plus one. The superstar is currently in Australia, where she performed at the Women's Cricket World Cup Final in Melbourne. The singer was midway through performing her hit Wide Awake at the closing ceremony on Sunday when she revealed what gender she wants her baby to be. Pausing for a moment, Katy surprised fans by declaring, 'I hope it's a girl!' The pop star announced her pregnancy last Wednesday, showing off her bump in her new music video Never Worn White. Just minutes after the world premiere, she tweeted she was glad to finally be able to come clean about her secret, writing: 'omg so glad I don't have to suck it in anymore, or carry around a big purse lol.' Less than an hour later, Perry confirmed she was in fact expecting her first child with fiancé Orlando Bloom in an Instagram Live video, admitting it is 'probably the longest secret' she has 'ever had to keep'. 'There's a lot that will be happening this summer, not only will I be giving birth - literally - but also figuratively to something you guys have been waiting for,' she said in the clip. The Firework hitmaker admitted she and Bloom are ecstatic about their bundle of joy, as well as her new music. 'So let's call it a double whammy, a two fore,' she added. 'I'm excited, we're excited and we're happy - and it's probably the longest secret I've ever had to keep.' 'I knew I would tell you in the best way, which is through a piece of music because that's how I speak to you.' It is the first child for Katy and British actor Orlando, 43, who has a son, Flynn, nine, with former model Miranda Kerr. Katy and Orlando first started dating in early 2016, but split in February 2017. The couple reconciled in April 2018, and the Pirates of the Caribbean star popped the question in a romantic Valentine's Day proposal the following year. Following her pregnancy news, the star was overjoyed by the positive reaction from her fans. She wrote on Twitter: 'love u guys so much. was a bit nervous about sharing something so personal like the song n the bump n I hv never gotten this much love n support, it's overwhelmingly lovely. thank u (sic)'.",real
"Remarkable no-holds barred notes by JFK have revealed his sexual preferences and his fears about being outed as an adulterer in 1960. The 98 pages of notes were made throughout 1960 as John F. Kennedy was in the midst of a fiery presidential campaign. Kennedy wrote down his thoughts to communicate with aides when he lost his voice on the election trail. Most researchers agree that Marilyn Monroe and JFK had slept together before she performed at his birthday address in 1962. In late March 1962, it's thought they spent the night together after a party in Palm Springs. On May 19, Marilyn was sewn into a special outfit for her legendary performance. She launched a breathy, sexually charged rendition of 'Happy Birthday', cheered on by the audience. Most researchers believe that this turned out to be the last interaction in their affair. In one note, he confided that his love of blonde women could come back to haunt him if it became common knowledge ahead of the vote. In another note, thought to date from October 1960, when asked about potential post-election holiday plans, he wrote: 'If I win maybe Florida or Puerto Rico. If I lose around the world in 180 days. 'I suppose that if I win my poon (an old naval term for sex) days are over.' He then expresses his fear about this becoming public: 'I suppose they are going to hit me with something before we are finished.' On the reverse is another sexual reference. JFK, who married his brunette wife Jackie in 1953, scribbled down: 'I got into the blondes.' His love of blonde women clearly didn't desert him after becoming president as he reportedly had an affair with film icon Marilyn Monroe. It was Kennedy's affair with Marilyn Monroe - his most famous mistress - that most worried wife Jackie, who feared he would be impeached for his bad judgment if it was exposed. Decades after his assassination, new revelations continue to surface about his lovers who include actresses Anita Ekberg, Gene Tierney, and Marlene Dietrich, and White House intern Mimi Alford, as well as two White House secretaries. Kennedy's other affairs included British-born actress Jean Simmons who said that he 'practically broke down' her hotel room door to demand sex with her. Angie Dickinson, who starred in the original Ocean's 11 in the 1960s, called sex with Kennedy, 'the most exciting seven minutes of my life.' One White House secretary, Mary Gallagher, told Andersen that she recalled seeing Hepburn come in to see Kennedy when he was a young senator. 'I remember Audrey Hepburn and I remember how the whole office was impressed when she walked in. She was as graceful as a swan and carried a long, slim red umbrella,' she said. At the time Hepburn had just won an Oscar for Roman Holiday and was about to start filming Sabrina with Humphrey Bogart. Andersen writes that she 'out-Jackied Jackie' with how she presented herself. Kennedy's other targets allegedly included Hamlet star Simmons who was filming 1958 film Home Before Dark in Boston when he tried to barge into her hotel room but she rebuffed him. Lee Remick, the blond star of Days of Wine and Roses, also had a fling with him when she was 22, six years younger than Jackie. Remick was described as 'drop dead gorgeous' and the 'epitome of class and intelligence', Andersen writes. Angie Dickinson described Kennedy as 'the killer type, a devastatingly handsome, charming man - the kind of man your mother hoped you wouldn't marry.' Her assessment of sex with the former president: 'It was the most exciting seven minutes of my life.' But not everyone fell for Kennedy's charm, including legendary actress Sophia Loren, who at the time was 24 and had just refused a marriage proposal from actor Cary Grant, her co-star on the film Houseboat. Instead she intended to marry the film's producer Carlo Ponti. As well as his adulterous side the notes also provide a fascinating insight into his volatile state of mind as the pressure ratcheted up in the contest. He often used foul language unbecoming to his polished image while insulting his opponents and members of the press, calling one of them a b*****d. He wrote of his colleague 'did you hear me stick it up Myles a*s today'. And of the famous American columnist Doris Fleeson, he wrote: 'I am her second choice. Her first choice is any son of a b***h but her second choice.' In other musings, Kennedy delivers a withering critique of his competitors including Minnesota senator Hubert Humphrey who he describes as 'bitter'. Fearful of Humphrey's debating skills, he observes that 'we shouldn't have this (debate) before a live audience'. The notes reveal Kennedy was aware of the importance of the 'racial issue' in America and how crucial it could be to his election chances. On one occasion, he wrote: 'Should I bring in the racial issue. I had planned to speak about Civil Rights earlier in the day.' JFK was stuck down by laryngitis on the campaign trail and was instructed by his doctor and speech coach not to speak while travelling. An assistant by the name of Janet DesRosiers was tasked with making sure that he didn't speak. The notes, made on yellow legal pads, have been owned by many years by a private collector. They have emerged for sale with Heritage Auctions, of Dallas, Texas, where they are expected to fetch $20,000. Curtis Linder, specialist at Heritage, said: 'A woman by the name of Janet Des Rosiers, who had been Joe Kennedy's long-time mistress and personal assistant and who was now traveling on Kennedy's plane, was tasked with making sure that he didn't speak. 'She kept him supplied with legal pads so he could communicate with those around him and still keep enough of his voice to make speeches and talk to reporters. 'JFK was a prolific doodler and these notes give a fascinating insight into his state of mind during the vigorous campaign. 'Some of the language and content of these notes would certainly have shocked many members of the electorate of that day. 'He would certainly not have wanted his note about liking blondes to go public! 'There was always debate about whether he was having affairs with Marilyn Monroe and interns at the White House. 'This archive deserves to be prized for the historical treasure it is, as it is highly unlikely that original material offering such an insight into the landmark 1960 election will be offered again.' Singer-songwriter Carly Simon revealed last year that Jackie was very much aware of her husband's infidelities. Simon spoke about President John F Kennedy and Aristotle Onasis' extramarital relationships in an interview with NBC News, and how they affected her good friend. 'In a cheerful but resigned way, she told me that of course she knew about them,' the You're So Vain singer wrote in her book, Touched By the Sun: My Friendship with Jackie. 'She just didn't mind their presence as much as she might have. Because she knew he [Kennedy] loved her much, much more than any of his dalliances.' 'For instance, his not being there for the birth of a child, his being off with a mistress while she was in the hospital,' said Simon of President Kennedy being absent for the birth of one of his children. 'There are various things that he did that by comparison to having a mistress must have hurt more.' President Kennedy was present for the birth of his two sons, John jr and Patrick, as well as daughter Caroline. He was not present however when Jackie delivered a stillborn daughter in 1956, and as was reported at the time was instead on a yacht with friends - and his alleged mistress.",real
"Steven Spielberg's adopted daughter has revealed that she is one week sober following her domestic violence arrest. Mikaela Spielberg was charged with domestic assault causing bodily harm against Chuck Pankow, 47, earlier this month and booked into the Hill Detention Center in Nashville, Tennessee. The 24-year-old has since revealed to her more than 76,000 Instagram followers that she 'just celebrated a week sober'. 'Navigating my own fears like a pro who somehow still knows nothing,' Mikaela shared on her private account, according to Page Six. 'Send me good loving energy y'all and I can try to put that into the world. I'll still be a flirty odd duck at the end of the day. 'I'm really trying to improve my connection to my body and manifest personal safety and genuine caution as it relates to me,' she added.  Tensions reportedly escalated when Pankow made a 'rude comment' toward Mikaela, prompting her to get angry and throw objects at him Authorities did not disclose what type of objects were allegedly launched at Pankow, but one object struck his hand and left a visible injury. It resulted in dried blood on his hand, a swollen wrist and marks on the skin.Officers later said the injuries appeared fresh and recent. Both Mikaela and Pankow admitted the dispute to authorities when they arrived at the scene.It's unclear who called Nashville police. However, Mikaela reportedly changed her version of the domestic dispute and made conflicting statements, authorities said. They determined Mikaela was the aggressor in the incident based off of the victim's statements, his visible injuries and her changing statements. Pankow, a professional dart player, refused to prosecute over the alleged domestic assault, but authorities are prosecuting on his behalf. 'No one is hurt,' Pankow, said, adding that it was all a 'misunderstanding'. After her arrest, someone posted a $1,000 bond on Mikaela's behalf. A week before the incident, Mikaela revealed that she was embarking on a new career as a porn star. Sources told The Sun that while her famous director father and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, support their child, they are also 'embarrassed' about her decision to pursue work in the world of adult films. 'Outwardly, Steven and Kate - who are the most evolved parents in the world and love their kids beyond all measure - have always been supportive of Mikaela and try to understand her,' a family friend told the publication. 'Obviously, though, they're embarrassed by her sudden public admission of entry into the sex worker world.' In a new interview, the Nashville-based adult film star, who was adopted as a baby by Spielberg, 73, and Capshaw, 66, revealed that she only recently told her parents about her new line of work, but said that they have been very supportive of her career choice. 'My safety has always been a number one priority for them,' Mikaela told The Sun, while revealing that she broke the news to them via FaceTime over the weekend. 'I'm doing this, not out of an urge to hurt anybody or be spiteful about it, I'm doing this because I want to honor my body in a way that's lucrative.' Describing herself as a 'sexual creature', Mikaela went on to explain that she was eager to find a way to 'capitalize on her body', having grown frustrated with working in a more traditional job that 'wasn't satisfying her soul'. She also shared that her new career has given her a feeling of empowerment and confidence that she never thought she'd be able to have, with the budding stripper revealing that she suffered abuse at the hand of 'predators' as a child, which later sparked a series of mental health issues. Over the past few years, Mikaela has struggled with anorexia, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism, all of which she says are the result of childhood sexual abuse. However, she notes that her abusers were not a part of her family, or her parents' inner circle of friends. Mikaela explained that the work she is now doing in the porn industry makes her feel 'good' because she is able to 'satisfy' others without being 'violated'. Thus far, Mikaela has only worked on solo videos, which she self-produced and then published on popular free porn website PornHub. However, she has since removed her clips because she wants to obtain her Tennessee adult entertainment permit before sharing any more content. And while she says she is open to trying 'fetish work', Mikaela insists that she will not have sex with another person on camera out of respect for her fiance, who she describes as being 100 per cent supportive of her career. While Chuck is supportive now, she admits that he took some time to get to grips with her adult film work, something that she says was due in part to his southern background, noting that there is 'still so much shame around it' in the South. 'The reason I don't want to do anything outside of solo stuff is because I feel like it would be a violation of my boundaries and my relationship with my significant other,' she said, adding that she thinks she would be 'great at fetish work'. Mikaela's porn videos thus far have focused primarily on her naturally large breasts, which she refers to as her 'moneymaker' - and which she admits she never felt proud of until trying porn for the first time. 'Honestly I have hated my chest for so long but I've finally learned to embrace it. That was one of the things when I uploaded these first couple of videos, I realized, ""This is the moneymaker"" - my large chest,' she said. Her videos have featured titles like 'I give my huge natural breasts some love and care with rose tea oil', and 'Huge breasted woman pleasures herself in calm environment'. Although Mikaela has since removed her videos from PornHub, she says that she had already amassed quite a dedicated following of fans, who 'said cool things' about her body and her work, something that she described as 'nice and refreshing'. 'People can often say really upsetting things about a black woman's body sometimes,' she added. But while her clips have been well received on PornHub, Mikaela has faced backlash from within her social circle in Tennessee, blaming any 'resentment' on 'the environment we live in right now'. She also insists that her choice to go into porn was not about 'hit[ting] bottom,' but rather about owning her sexuality - and making money. Her goal now is to make enough in the industry so she's 'not tied down financially by things'. 'I can't stay dependent on my parents or even the state for that matter — not that there's anything wrong with that — it just doesn't feel comfortable for me,' she said. Forbes has estimated that her father's net worth issomewhere between $3.7billion and $6.08billion. In his illustrious Hollywood career, he's directed and produced more than 100feature films, including Jaws, ET, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List,Saving Private Ryan, The Goonies, Indiana Jones, Hook, Catch Me if You Can, and The Post. And Mikaela thinks that both of her 'amazing parents' will approve of her path 'once they see how far I've come'. 'They're going to look at this and go, ""Wow, we actually raised are really self-assured, young lady,""' she said. Mikaela didn't mention what her siblings thought of her chosen career. The porn star has three brothers and three sisters. Her oldest sister,Jessica Capshaw, 43, was her mom Kate's daughter with ex-husbandRobert Capshaw, and is now a famous actress in her own right. There's also brother Max, 33, sister Sasha, 29, brother Sawyer, 27, sisterDestry, 23, and brother Theo, 31, who was also adopted. But while quite a few of her siblings popped up in their dad's films over the years, Mikaela seems to have shied away from the spotlight until now. She said that as a child she was 'spoiled, but responsibly' and her parents raised her to understand the value of hard work, human dignity, and how poverty impacts the world. Mikaela noted that she and her dad were close, describing him as an 'angel' who loves that she knows her own mind. They liked to play computer games together and have 'dorky' conversations, in which her dad would 'nurture' her creativity and identity. But she started to develop issues as she got older, attributing her problems to abuse she suffered from someone outside the family. By 11, she had started drinking to cope with her trauma, and as a teenagershe was sent to a boarding school for troubled teens. But rather than help get her in line, it worsened her anxiety, depression, self-hatred, and attachment issues.It was there that she developed an eating disorder She continued to drink for years, and at age 21 was drinking every day. She admits she 'almost died a couple times'. Still, she said unequivocally that it wasn't her parents' fault, and they 'couldn't have known' what she was dealing with. 'I've had my fights and struggles with them, but it's only out of fear that people sometimes care incorrectly because they want you to be alive and safe,' she said. 'They are some of the least spiteful people I know. I love them so deeply.'",real
"A father from Tennessee has written a heartbreaking account detailing how his young daughter lost her life during last week's tornadoes in the state. Matt Collins' tear-jerkingpost tells how he tightly held onto his four-year-old daughterHattie throughout the deadly storm, before it claimed her life. Hattie was one of five children killed in the Putnam County tornadoes which struck on March 3. The two tornadoes ended up killing 24 people in total and destroyed 500 homes and businesses. Collins took to Facebook to recall the moments he held onto his daughter and 'never let her touch the ground' as the twister swirled around them. 'Ever since she was born, Hattie has loved being held,' Collins writes. The family were initially woken up by a tornado alert that flashed up on his wife, Macy's phone. As the storm came closer, he woke Hattie up and ran towards his other infant daughter's room, Lainey, who was asleep in her crib. Moments later, the tornado hit. 'Everything was collapsing and going up around us. I was yelling as loud as I could. I don't remember what I said or even if what I said were words at all, but my yells were pleads for my girls to hang on. The four of us were relocated by the storm to somewhere around our front porch, we think. We were in the dirt, in the crawl space, but together,' Collin's says. He describes how in the moments following the tornado he and his wife both blacked out untilKory and Lauren Farmer, their next door neighbors, came to their rescue. 'Kory could hear my screams. He had a light and was able to locate the four of us. Macy was holding Lainey. I was holding Hattie. We had never let go. Kory took the girls from our arms because he could see all 4 of us were injured... My girls never touched the ground.' In the chaos, ambulances were called in an effort to get the family to hospital. His little girl, Hattie, was in the arms of a neighbor but she had already died. Collin's then focused on getting his wife to a hospital. Neighbors managed to drive them both while another looked after his other toddler child, Lainey. 'Every interaction we had that night was with God's people. Words do not do justice for how we feel for Hattie. The pain is unbearable at times, and present all the time. We have also been overwhelmed with love and support from all over,' Collins goes on to write. He finishes his heartbreaking post by telling how mom, Macy, would always read their Hattie a story each night before she went to bed. On the night of the storm, Hattie appeared to say something profound:'Mommy, I can see Jesus and he is wearing all white,' she said. 'Hattie could see more clearly than the rest of us,' Collin's alludes. 'Before we knew Jesus was going to hold her that night, she did. We do not believe the Lord took our girl from us. We believe he is holding our girl for us. And Hattie loves to be held.' A GoFundMepage has been set up for the family to help rebuild their lives. Hattie loves to be held. Ever since she was born, Hattie has loved being held. In 4.5 years, she has slept with Macy and I nearly every single night — close. She wants to feel you. Early on Tuesday morning March 3, Hattie had wound up in our bed once again. She was asleep between Macy and I when Macy's phone went off alerting us of a tornado warning in Putnam County. She immediately woke me up, where I quickly turned the TV on. Dan Thomas from Channel 4 was on, and his first words I heard alerted those around Upperman High School to take cover. We immediately grabbed Hattie out of the bed and begin running as fast as possible towards Lainey's room to grab her out of the crib. Macy grabbed Lainey, I had Hattie, and we hit the floor. The sound around us was unlike anything I have ever heard. Deafening silence. As soon as we hit the ground with the girls, the tornado hit. Everything was collapsing and going up around us. I was yelling as loud as I could. I don't remember what I said or even if what I said were words at all, but my yells were pleads for my girls to hang on. The four of us were relocated by the storm to somewhere around our front porch, we think. We were in the dirt, in the crawl space, but together. The following are memories I do not have. Macy and I both blacked out around this time, and have no memory until we woke up across the street at a house that was still standing. The rest of this story is filled with God's people, many at Collegeside, who came to our aid. Kory and Lauren Farmer are our neighbors. Their house was also lost in the storm, but they were able to escape. Soon after the storm passed, Kory could hear my screams. He had a light and was able to locate the four of us. Macy was holding Lainey. I was holding Hattie. We had never let go. Kory took the girls from our arms because he could see all 4 of us were injured. More neighbors, Luke and Amy Carty, had been able to escape and get to Luke's truck. Luke and Amy had Jill Mynatt and her family in the truck with them. Kory handed Hattie to Jill and Lainey to Amy. My girls never touched the ground. Luke drove hoping to make it to the McBroom Chapel church building but couldn't. He was able to make it to Amy Jennings house, where some of the truck was unloaded. Amy took care of Lainey, getting her out of wet clothes and keeping her warm. When an ambulance was able to locate the group, Jill held Lainey and checked her into the hospital. Luke was holding Hattie. She had already passed. Luke held her though. Hattie loves to be held. My girls never touched the ground. Luke turned her over to the professionals when they arrived on the scene to go help more people. There is no doubt the Hensley neighborhood saved each other that night. Back at our location, Kory, (and others I cannot remember), broke a door down to make a stretcher for Macy. They got her to a vehicle and to the hospital. I was helped to the car of Brandon Pruitt who drove me to the hospital. Every interaction we had that night was with God's people. The church saved our life. I'm confident there are more names that I could have added that I do not remember. We are living the the tension of devastation and love. Words do not do justice for how we feel for Hattie. The pain is unbearable at times, and present all the time. We have also been overwhelmed with love and support from all over. We thank you for your prayers — we have seen God this week in the lives of so many. God worked through his people Tuesday morning — Kory, Lauren, Luke, Amy, Jill and others — and we were recipients of their love. Every night before bed, Macy would read Hattie a story. Monday night, after they finished reading, Hattie looked up at Macy as she often does after story time. Hattie would rather talk than sleep. She told her, 'Mommy, I can see Jesus and he is wearing all white.' Hattie could see more clearly than the rest of us. Before we knew Jesus was going to hold her that night, she did. We do not believe the Lord took our girl from us. We believe he is holding our girl for us. And Hattie loves to be held ",real
"Federal and state officials in California were preparing Monday to receive thousands of people from a cruise ship that has been idling off the coast of San Francisco with at least 21 people aboard infected with the coronavirus. Personnel covered head to toe in protective gear woke passengers on the Grand Princess to check whether they have symptoms of COVID-19. Fences were being installed at an 11-acre site at the Port of Oakland, as authorities readied flights and buses to whisk the2,421 passengers aboard the Grand Princess to military bases or their home countries for a 14-day quarantine. The ship, linked to California's first death from COVID-19 from an earlier voyage to Mexico, will then leave with the remaining 1,094 crew, who are mostly foreign nationals, quarantined on board. It is expected the process will take up to three days. 'We're making every effort to get them off the ship as safely and quickly as possible,' said Dr. John Redd of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, who urged passengers to remain in their rooms. On Sunday, the U.S. State Department issued an advisory against travel on cruise ships, particularly for travelers with underlying health conditions. The statement said the CDC noted an 'increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment.' Passengers requiring acute medical attention and hospitalization will be allowed off theGrand Princess first and taken to health care facilities elsewhere in California, as would a relatively limited number of crew expected to need immediate treatment, California Governor Gavin Newsom said. The remaining U.S.based passengers will be transferred to one of four quarantine stations set up at military bases in California and elsewhere across the country for diagnostic testing and isolation, officials said. All will remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the presumed incubation period of the sometimes-deadly respiratory virus, also known as COVID-19, while they are tested and monitored for signs of infection. Scroll down for video Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most common symptoms are: Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  As the U.S. death toll from the virus reached at least 22 and the number of cases worldwide soared above 110,000, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought to reassure the public that none of the Grand Princess passengers would be exposed to the U.S. public before completing the quarantine. To hasten the triage process and minimize how much time the ship needs to remain in Portland, the U.S. Coast Guard was flying special mobile medical teams out to the vessel on Sunday to assess the health of passengers and crew ahead of their arrival, Newsom said. Passengers who are well and from California - about 1,000 have been identified as state residents - will be taken to either Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento or Marine Corps Air Station Miramar close to San Diego. Passengers from other states will be transported to either Joint Base San Antonio Lackland in Texas or Dobbins Air Force Base in Georgia. That number was not specified, though at least 34 are from Georgia, according to state officials. State and federal authorities has said several hundred cruise passengers of other nationalities have been identified, including Canadians. Newsom said passengers and crew together represent 54 countries. Michele Smith, of Paradise, California, said a doctor knocked on her and her husband's cabin before dawn and asked if they had a fever or a cough. The couple who went on the cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary are healthy and, like the rest of the 2,400 passengers aboard, have been isolating in their cabins since Thursday. The number of infections in the United States climbed above 500 as testing for the virus increased. The 75-year-old male passenger who traveled on the Grand Princess and died from the virus was infected before he came on board the quarantined vessel, the medical officer on the vessel said Sunday. The origins of the infection have left the fate of the ship in question as public health officials deal with a dozen cases of the virus in California linked to passengers who were on board traveling to Mexico last month, including the man who died. Newsom said public health authorities were monitoring more than 1,500 other California residents who were on that Mexico cruise. It comes asThe Regal Princess cruise ship pulled into a Florida port late Sunday night, after being held off Florida's coast for hours while awaiting results for two crew members who eventually tested negative for coronavirus. The Regal Princess was originally to have docked Sunday morning in Port Everglades but instead spent most of the day sailing up and down the coast. The Coast Guard delivered testing kits to the Regal Princess and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a 'no-sail order' for the ship. The crew members in question had transferred more than two weeks ago from the Grand Princess cruise ship. A Port of Everglades spokeswoman, Ellen Kennedy, said later Sunday that the CDC had cleared the ship to enter port. A Princess Cruises statement issued early Monday said the CDC issued the clearance after the test results came back negative. It was later confirmed that two of the presumptive positive cases of coronavirus inBroward County, Florida, are connected toPort Everglades port. It was not clear how the cases are connected to theactive cruise ship port. The Florida Department of Health has reported 13 cases of coronavirus in the state, including two deaths. The Port of Oakland was chosen for docking because of its proximity to an airport and a military base, Newsom said. U.S. passengers will be transported to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia, where they'll be tested for the COVID-19 virus and quarantined. 'That ship will turn around - and they are currently assessing appropriate places to bring that quarantined ship - but it will not be here in the San Francisco Bay,' Newsom said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health's infectious diseases chief, said Sunday that widespread closure of a city or region, as Italy has done, is 'possible.' U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done in the Seattle, Washington, area amid an outbreak at a care home that has killed 17. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency Sunday because of the virus. Princess Cruises, a unit of the world’s leading cruise operator, Carnival Corp, is also owner of the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined off Japan in February and became for a time the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside of China, where the outbreak originated. On the Grand Princess, passengers Steven and Michele Smith of Paradise, California, said they hope their time spent on the ship in quarantine will count toward the 14 days they are expected to isolate themselves. But they said officials have not yet provided an answer. 'We would love to get credit for the three or four days we've spent in our cabin,' Steven Smith said. Passenger Margaret Bartlett, 77, told the BBC: 'The food is rotten and terrible and we have to fight for it. It is not good enough.' The ship was held off the coast amid evidence it was the breeding ground for a cluster of at least 20 cases from a previous voyage. Private companies and some public venues in the U.S. have been taking safety measures in an effort to limit the virus' spread. Several universities have begun online-only courses, including the University of Washington, Stanford University and Columbia University. The largest school district in Northern California, with 64,000 students, canceled classes for a week when it was discovered a family in the district was exposed to COVID-19. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MORE THAN 700 CASES AND SIX DEATHS FROM DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP In the worst cruise ship crisis so far, 706 people tested positive on the Diamond Princess after Japanese authorities imposed a two-week lockdown in Yokohama. At least six people have died after they were taken to hospital from the doomed vessel. Passengers were confined to their cabins during the lockdown but several countries eventually lost patience with Japan and airlifted their citizens home. Japan was widely criticised for its handling of the ship, with one disease expert saying the quarantine was 'completely inadequate' after viewing the conditions on board. Kentaro Iwata said the situation on board the vessel was worse than outbreaks he had dealt with in the past, such as Ebola in Africa and the 2003 SARS crisis in China. The Kobe University infectious diseases expert said conditions on the ship were 'completely chaotic' and violated quarantine rules. Japan had initially impounded the ship after a passenger who left the ship in Hong Kong in January subsequently tested positive. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital – with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus – and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers – so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS – the virus that ripped across China in 2003 – which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESN’T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives – which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month – particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone – with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it – 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 – but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions – such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems – are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten – and if children do get the virus it’s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms –particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area – are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms – such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready. As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, health experts advise plane travelers to sit in a window seat, disinfect their table trays and window blinds, and warn that wearing a mask won't prevent infection. Officials say the best way to avoid catching the virus, which is spread through viral particles within mucus or saliva, is to keep your hands clean, disinfect your space, and avoid touching your face. It is also advised that plane travelers choose a window seat to have less contact with potentially sick people. 'Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,' Vicki Stover Hertzberg, professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, said. Hertzberg helped conduct a study that followed passengers and crew members on 10 three to five-hour flights during the flu season and found that passengers who sit in the window seats had less contact with ill people. Wearing a mask on the plane may not prove helpful as the air in the aircraft is considered sterile because there are so few microorganisms at such a high altitude and the plane draws fresh air from the outside. About 50 percent of the air in cabins is recirculated but it goes through sophisticated air filters similar to those used in surgical environments, before it's its pushed back into the plane. A problem with paper masks is that they don't have a respirator to filter out infectious air articles. That means passengers are more likely to catch the virus through direct contact from someone with the virus or surfaces rather than through the air. But one study found that the other coronaviruses - such as SARS and MERS - remains on metal, glass, and plastic surfaces for up to nine days. Top tips include: - Good hand hygiene: Frequently wash hands for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitzer - Disinfect your space: Bring your own wipes and wipe down window blinds, seat belts, arm rests, touch screens and tray tables - Choose a window seat: Sit near the window and avoid moving around the cabin to limit exposure to potentially sick people - Use touch screen with a tissue: Avoid contact with surfaces that may hold the virus - Avoid touching your face: 2019-nCov is spread through viral particles in mucus or saliva. Avoid touching your face and transferring germs picked up from surfaces",real
"The trial of two American students accused of the fatal stabbing of an Italian policeman during a botched drug deal was dramatically halted today over fears that the youngsters would be exposed to the deadly coronavirus. Finnegan Lee Elder and Gabriel Natale-Hjorth were due to appear in court in Rome to learn what evidence would be presented to the jury over charges that they killed newly-wed officer Mario Cerciello Rega, 35, in July last year. But Judge Marina Finiti adjourned the hearing for five weeks so that Elder, 20 and Natale-Hjorth, 19, would not risk exposure to the deadly virus that has devastated Italy – killing 366, infecting more than 7,500 and causing 16 million – a quarter of the population – to be quarantined. The judge had ordered that youngsters appear by video link so that they would not risk being exposed to the virus by coming to the court house in central Rome. Prison authorities took it upon themselves to move the pair to Rome's sprawling Rebibbia prison as the smaller Regina Coeli jail where they are being held does not have filming equipment. But Judge Finiti had not been informed that the students would have to be moved to the larger jail where they would have been at great risk of exposure to the coronavirus. She told the court: 'There's an emergency situation going on. I want this to be stopped. 'If the prison authorities have to move them to Rebibbia [prison] they might as well have come down here. 'It's for their safety, our safety and the safety of all participants in the proceeding that I adjourn this hearing.' Judge Finiti adjourned the hearing until April 17 when the trial will resume. In an official notice she ruled: 'Given the emergency situation the president postponed this hearing to another date.' But she added: 'But this could all change due to the development of this coronavirus emergency.' During the brief hearing Judge Finiti urged the legal teams to respect the emergency measures brought in to halt the spread of the virus by sitting one meter apart and not shaking hands and kissing, contrary to Italian tradition. The students' parents, Ethan and Leah Elder and Fabrizio Natale and Heidi Hjorth, had decided not to attend hearing amid fears that they may had to go into isolation when they returned to their homes in San Francisco California, DailyMail.com has learned. However the widow of Deputy-Brigadier Mario Cerciello Rega, Mario Rosaria Esilio, did attend the brief hearing. Elder and Natale-Hjorth, who were on holiday in Rome at the time, face life sentences if found guilty of the murder of Carabinieri officer Cerciello Rega. The pair are also charged with carrying a knife, resisting arrest and attempted extortion. The killing in July last year caused a nationwide outcry. The case has been compared to that of Amanda Knox, the American college student who was convicted and later acquitted of murdering her British flat-mate Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Umbria, in November 2007. Meanwhile riots have erupted in jails across Italy - with six prisoners killed in Modena Prison over the weekend – after authorities suspended visits and amid inmates fears that they are being abandoned to the virus. Elder has admitted to stabbing Cerciello with a 7-inch serrated-edge combat knife he had stashed in his sweatshirt but told investigators he thought he and his friend were being set upon by drug dealers. Elder's legal team claim their client Elder acted in self-defense when he stabbed officer Rega. Natale-Hjorth's lawyers are attempting to distance their client from Elder and for him to be judged separately for his part in the events. Both boys claim their confessions to the murder were signed under duress and after hours of bullying and intimidation. Pictures and film of Natale-Hjorth being questioned while blind-folded in the hours after their arrests were leaked to Italian media. Their lawyers have called for film from a bank's security camera overlooking the murder scene, seized by the police investigators, should be made public as it supports their clients' case of self-defense. Prosecutors claim the film is of no interest to the case. Rega's death caused uproar throughout Italy. ",real
"Bill Gates and his charity are funding a new home-testing kit for coronavirus that is expected to be ready for distribution in the greater Seattle area in the coming weeks. The test will allow people experiencing symptoms of coronavirus to swab their noses and then send the samples to a lab for an analysis. The results would then be available within one to two days. Those who test positive would have those results shared with local health officials, according to The Seattle Times. Whoever is infected would then be asked to share information online about where they traveled to and with whom they were in contact. This would make it easier for health officials to notify others who may need to be either tested for coronavirus or quarantined as a precautionary measure. The system would also allow the authorities to better track the spread of the virus and identify potential ‘hot spots.’ The new virus, called COVID-19,is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms including a sore throat, headache, fever, cough or trouble breathing. Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure. Scott Dowell, the head of the coronavirus response team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, told the Times that the lab conducting the tests will initially be able to analyze 400 samples per day. With time, the lab will be able to test thousands of kits a day, he said. The foundation started by the co-founder of Microsoft, one of the world's richest people, is dedicated to eradicating illness in developing countries. Dowell told the Times that the foundation is working as quickly as possible in order to ramp up production of the kits, though the exact launch date has yet to be determined. The experts working on the project are looking to boost the software so that it can handle what is expected to be considerable demand during and after its roll-out. ‘Although there’s a lot to be worked out, this has enormous potential to turn the tide of the epidemic,’ Dowell said. Washington State has been the hardest hit by coronavirus, which has infected at least 80 residents. At least 18 Washingtonians, most of them linked to a Seattle-area nursing home, have died, which is also a high for the country. Gates’ foundation as well as state and local health agencies are trying to fill the void left by the federal government, which is coming under severe criticism for its failure to provide testing to citizens in a timely fashion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's response to the coronavirus outbreak was blasted by critics as it was revealed the agency has only tested 1,583 people for the deadly, flu-like virus since the first cases were identified in the US in January. The figure will increase as more tests are sent through the country to address demand, said Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn, while speaking to reporters at the White House this weekend. Meanwhile, the federal government has shipped enough kits to public health labs to test another 75,000 patients. The CDC and public health labs had run 5,861 tests for the coronavirus as of Friday, Hahn of the FDA said, though officials could not say how many total patients have been tested. Adding to confusion which has plagued the government's campaign to contain the outbreak were comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the infectious diseases unit at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci admitted on Meet the Press on Sunday that early attempts to send out coronavirus test kits were plagued by delays, but said that testing capacity is 'accelerating dramatically'. His figures for how many tests have been sent out were far higher than the CDC's earlier report. 'I believe, 1.1 million tests have already been sent out. By Monday, there'll be an additional 400,000. And by the end of next week, probably around four million.' A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond when DailyMail.com reached out for clarification. Meanwhile, the agency's delayed response to the outbreak drew fire from critics. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that local officials are working hard to identify new cases but have been greatly hindered by the CDC. He called it 'outrageous and ludicrous' that the agency has not authorized private labs to conduct automated tests. 'CDC, wake up. Let the states test. Let private labs test. Let's increase as quickly as possible our testing capacity so we identify the positive people, so we can isolate them,' he said. After facing similar criticism over the pace of testing in the U.S., the FDA made it easier for commercial labs to manufacture and perform their own tests. More than 2.1 million of those tests are expected to be shipped by Monday to commercial labs, Hahn said. That, however, would translate to roughly 850,000 people who can seek testing because under current CDC guidelines, two swabs are required per patient. Gates has been quoted as saying that one of his biggest fears is that world governments are ill-prepared to deal with future pandemics. Last month, he warned that the coronavirus is beginning to behave like a 'once-in-a-century' pathogen with the potential to kill more people than the 66,000 Americans who died in the 1957 influenza pandemic. 'The data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1 per cent,' Gates wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. 'This rate would make it many times more severe than typical seasonal influenza, putting it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic (0.6 per cent) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2 per cent).' The Asian flu of 1957 killed 2 million people globally, according to the World Health Organization. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has already pledged $100million to fight the outbreak. Gates also called for accelerated testing of vaccines. He noted that several promising candidates are already being prepared for clinical trials. 'If some of these vaccines prove safe and effective in animal models, they could be ready for larger-scale trials as early as June,' he wrote. 'Drug discovery can also be accelerated by drawing on libraries of compounds that have already been tested for safety and by applying new screening techniques, including machine learning, to identify antivirals that could be ready for large-scale clinical trials within weeks.' Meanwhile, the number of infections in the United States climbed above 500 and the national death toll reached at least 21 as testing for the virus increased. Fauci said Sunday that widespread closure of a city or region, as Italy has done, is ‘possible.’ ‘You don't want to alarm people, but given the spread we see, you know anything is possible and that's the reason why we’ve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak,’ Fauci said on Fox News Sunday. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done in the Seattle area amid an outbreak at a care home that has killed 18. Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency Sunday after the number of confirmed cases there doubled from the previous day to 14. California Governor Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought Sunday to reassure the public that none of the passengers from a ship carrying people with the virus will be released into the public before undergoing a 14-day quarantine. The Grand Princess carrying more than 3,500 people from 54 countries is expected to dock Monday in Oakland, in the east San Francisco Bay, and was idling off the coast Sunday as officials prepared a port site. Those needing acute medical care will come off first.",real
"Stephen King went on social media to insist comparisons of The Stand, including one made by actor James Mardsen who stars in the TV latest adaptation of the novel, to the coronvirus are wrong. The acclaimed author tweeted that 'No, coronavirus is NOT like THE STAND,' Sunday night. 'It's not anywhere near as serious. It's eminently survivable. Keep calm and take all reasonable precautions' King's reaction came after several people, as well as actor James Mardsen - who stars in the latest TV adaptation of the 1978 novel - compared the virus to the current outbreak. In the post-apocalyptic, horror and science fiction thriller, a deadly influenza virus known as Captain Trips is created in an army lab and triggers a worldwide pandemic. There is no cure or vaccine for the disease, which ends up killing 99 per cent of the world's population. The virus also cause the complete collapse of society, prompts the military to censor information about the killer virus, and leaves only a handful of survivors in a state of confusion and grief. The book was King's fourth novel and longest, stand-alone book. It originally was turned into miniseries starring Gary Senise in 1994, and is now being adapted into a ten-episode, limited series for CBS Access starring Mardsen. The Sonic the Hedgehog star plays the Stu Redman, the hero character of the novel originally played by Senise in the miniseries, which also stars Molly Ringwald, of the 1980s brat pack fame. Mardsen on the new production's set in Vancouver, Canada, told Variety and iHeart's The Big Ticket podcast that working on the new adaptation as the coronavirus outbreak was unfolding had been unsettling. 'There are scenes in the beginning of The Stand where as soon as you see someone who looks normal sneeze or cough into their arm, everyone's eyes in the room darts towards them,' he explained. 'I see that in public now, and everyone kind of takes a few steps away from the person. It's crazy. We're in full panic mode right now.' Others online have made comments they too recalled the novel as the deadly flu-like virus known officially as CODVID19 has spread from its origin point in Wuhan, China, across the globe since December. So far, the virus has been blamed for more than 3,800 deaths, including 22 in the U.S., and has plunged the world's financial markets amid fears that it will grow into a global pandemic. One Twitter user named John Talbott, who goes tweets as Johmakarov380, speculated whether it was 'strange to think the coronavirus is the next Captain Trips?' A tweet from clayhead123 claims the Twitter user was half-way through the novel and that it had make him 'a LITTLE more nervous', adding the hasthags #thestand, #coronavirus, #CaptainTrips and #TheFlu. Another Twitter user who posts as Chelsea84T and describes herself as a mental health advocate from Alabama alluded to the federal government's delay in addressing the outbreak and its miscommunications to the public. The twitter user writes that she doesn't trust the government nor the the media. 'From now on, I'm calling it #CaptainTrip,' she proclaims in her post, which includes a scene from the original miniseries showing a crow, hinting at an impending doom. Another Twitter user who goes by Fatal1ty67 wrote that he felt like he was living his favorite novel of all time 'for real,' showing the an emoji of a skull. 'Is Randall Flagg out there somewhere #CaptainTrips,' wrote the Twitter user, who describes himself as married with two 'beautiful kids'. The Flagg mention was a reference to thenovel's villain, a supernatural madman named Randall Flagg. Flagg was played by actor Jamey Sheridan in the original miniseries. Alexander Skarsgård plays Flagg in the new version.",real
"President Donald Trump spent Monday morning in a tweet storm of self-praise from his vacation home of Mar-a-Lago before he headed to fundraisers for his re-election campaign. His online onslaught came as global markets tanked and members of Congress self-quarantined amid concern of being exposed to the coronavirus. A new oil war sparked by fears of the disease sent markets in disarray as investors signaled their alarm about economic damage expected from the virus. In the U.S.The S&P 500 and the Dow fell more than 7 percent at the start of trading. 'Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!' Trump tweeted Monday morning upon landing in Orlando, Florida. 'Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!' the president added. The Coronavirus situation has left Trump dealing with an enemy he can't break with a tweet, a chant at a campaign rally, a mocking name or a military raid. 'So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!' Trump said. The president signaled his frustration and fury with a Monday morning tweet fest that began before he left Mar-a-Lago and continued after he landed in Orlando, where his fundraisers are scheduled. Trump veeredbetween blamingthe media stoking flames of fear about the coronavirus and weighing in on the Democratic presidential nomination process. Trump will spend the afternoon in Orlando at a pair of closed-door fundraisers after spending the weekend holding multiple fundraising events at his Mar-a-Lago estate and playing golf with members of the World Series Champion Washington Nationals. He also held a dinner withBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago Saturday night. The president's re-election campaign said he is expected to raise around $10 million this weekend. Trump shot off 10 tweets before 9:30 a.m. ahead of his departure from Mar-a-Lago. 'The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American,""' he wrote. Trump's administration has been criticized for its response to the epidemic, particularly over the lack of kits to test for the disease. There have been 22 deaths in the United States from the disease and the number of infected have reached over 500. Trump defended his administration's work. 'Great job being done by the @vpand the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you!,' he wrote. 'The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world!,' he added. Meanwhile, two members of Congress announced they are self-quarantining after coming into contact with a person at CPAC who later tested positive for coronavirus. Texas Republican Ted Cruz said he shook hands with the infected man and has put himself into 14-day quarantine. 'Last night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for COVID-19,' Cruz said in a statement Sunday. 'That interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.' Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar joined Cruz by self-quarantining. 'I am announcing that I, along with three of my senior staff, are officially under self-quarantine after sustained contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus,' he said. Trump was also at CPAC but the White House said he did not have direct contact with the person infected. The president on Saturday down played concerns the disease was making its way closer to the White House. 'No, I'm not concerned at all,' he told reporters at Mar-a-Lago. The president also complained about the Democratic presidential primary, renewing his charge that Elizabeth Warren hurt Bernie Sanders on Super Tuesday by staying in the race as long as she did, and reissuing his warning the party was trying to deny Sanders the nomination. 'Elizabeth ""Pocahontas"" Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?,' he wrote. Trump also said, 'Now the Democrats are trying to smear Bernie with Russia, Russia, Russia. They are driving him Crazy!' In February, the news broke that Russia was trying to help Sanders' campaign - and the senator confirmed that he had been briefed on the matter. The New York Times then dredged up an old narrative about Sanders and Russia, saying that new documents show that the Kremlin was trying to take advantage of Sanders, then Burlington, Vermont's mayor, as he tried to form a 'sister' sister relationship with a town in the Soviet Union. Trump also brought up Chuck Schumer's warning to Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh that they would pay a price for their abortion rulings, a move that earned the senator a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. 'Cryin’ Chuck Schumer said, “You will pay the price for this. You won’t know what HIT YOU.” That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.""' Trump ended that tweet with the warning: 'Trouble ahead!'",real
"Flights from the US are still flying to Italy even though officials quarantined several cities due to the coronavirus outbreak, and passengers returning stateside from the region will not be screened upon landing. Italy is facing the worst coronavirus epidemic outside of China and on Sunday quarantined 16million people, banning citizens from entering or leaving northern cities including Milan, Venice, and Parma. However, flights are still entering and exiting Italy and other parts of the world. Passengers travelling to US airports from Italy won't be screened upon landing in the States as officials say travelers will be checked out by Italian officials. The Centers for Disease Control states that in the US airports will conduct entry screening for travelers from China and Iran but not for people arriving from Italy and South Korea because those countries will do exit screenings, the Atlanta Airport revealed to passengers in a tweet on Sunday. Scroll down for video The Centers for Disease Control has declared a Level 3 Warning for Italy urging the public to avoid nonessential travel due to widespread community transmission. As of Sunday the coronavirus death toll in Italy hit 366 and the confirmed number of cases in the country soared to 7,375. Flights continue to enter and exit Milan's Linate airport despite the coronavirus crisis. Italy's national carrier Alitalia said it would reduce the number of flights in and out of Milan but not stop them. Delta and American Airlines have already both suspended flights to Italy's financial capital of Milan. There's a stark difference in how the virus is being treated depending on country. The Donald Trump administration has enhanced the screening of travelers from China and Iran and funneled them to enter the country through 11 airports. David E. Short, deputy assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs, said at an industry event this week that the Trump administration has agreements with South Korea and Italy to screen passengers in those countries before they leave those countries. He said screening those travelers once they land in the US was determined to be 'not the most effective response', according to the Washington Post. 'Instead, what’s happening in those countries is a very enhanced level of pre-departure screening of passengers.' In South Korea, travelers go through three temperature checks and are thermal-screened when they arrive at the airport and again when passing through security. Passengers must also fill out a health questionnaire and are examined by medical professionals, Short said. Italy officials have a similar screening procedure. On March 1, President Trump vowed that anyone returning from 'high risk countries' would be screened both before they boarded planes and once they had returned to the US. On Monday, Vice President Pence said: 'Anyone traveling on a direct flight to the United States of America receives multiple screenings at all airports in Italy and South Korea.' DailyMail.com has contacted the State Department, as well as LAX, Chicago's O'Hare and JFK airports for comment in the wake of the vast Italian lockdown across a swath of its wealthy north on Sunday. The quarantine in Italy started to take effect on Sunday and will last through April 3. 'This is a national emergency,' Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, signing the law overnight. 'Our objectives are twofold: to contain the spread of infections — we can’t afford it — and we have to take action to prevent the overloading of our hospitals.' Around 50,000 US citizens are thought to currently reside in the country. It is not clear if the US government is developing any plans to bring them home. A spokesman for JFK told DailyMail.com: 'We are providing all necessary support for the screening being carried out by @CDCgov & @CBP of passengers who may have been exposed to #coronavirus & ensuing referrals for quarantine in conjunction with state & city health authorities.' A spokesman for LAX said the decision to screen is one taken by the CDC and refused to comment on whether the process is happening for those returning from Italy at the airport. The CDC have issued a Level 3 warning - their highest - to avoid all nonessential travel.They say on their website: 'To slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into the United States, CDC is working with state and local public health partners to implement after-travel health precautions. 'Depending on your travel history, you will be asked to stay home for a period of 14 days from the time you left an area with widespread or ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).' Trump had said last Saturday that travelers entering the United States from Italy, South Korea and Iran will face new restrictions. But as of Friday it was reported customs agencies were still not properly screening travelers arriving in the US from the coronavirus hot-spot countries, with scores of passengers saying they're able to saunter through major airports like JFK and LAX. Many travelers took to Twitter to share stories about returning to America from the high-risk countries with minimal to no screening. Many said the only question they were asked was if they had traveled recently to China. 'Just had family return from Italy, landed in Atlanta. They had their temperatures taken in Rome before boarding, but nothing upon arrival home. Not even a single question about where they had traveled in Italy. Nada,' Twitter user Joshua Frank posted. In addition to fears over how flights are being screened, there is growing criticism of the federal government's response to testing. On Friday, it was revealed a father and his sonstested positive for coronavirus in a Los Angeles suburb after a skiing trip to Italy. They were part of a group of about 15 that traveled back to the United States on February 27 after visiting Cortina d'Ampezzo in the Dolomite Mountains. Italy’s total known number of COVID-19 cases crept past that of South Korea, becoming the country with the second-highest number of infections Sunday after China. Italian government authorities say the country now has 7,375 cases. That is 62 more than South Korea. It was announced Sunday that the Vatican is shutting down its museums, which include access to the Sistine Chapel, until April 3.The Italian government’s decree also shut down outdoor sites like Pompeii’s archaeological ruins.  The new measures say people should not enter or leave Lombardy, Italy's richest region, as well as 14 provinces in four other regions, including the cities of Venice, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini. 'There will be no movement in or out of these areas, or within them, unless for proven, work-related reasons, emergencies or health reasons,' Conte told a news conference in the middle of the night after hours of confusion over his plans. The US government issued its strongest travel warning so far last Sunday, advising Americans against any travel to two regions in northern Italy that have been hard hit by the virus that first emerged in China in December. But it remains a level 3 warning to 'reconsider travel' to the rest of the country, advice that has not been updated since February. Tourism officials said an earlier U.S. travel warning covering all of Italy was potentially calamitous to the industry, which represents 13 per cent of gross domestic product in a country famed for its world-class museums, archaeological sites, art cities and natural beauty. More than 5.6 million Americans visit Italy every year, representing 9 per cent of foreign tourists and the second-largest national group behind Germans, according to the most recent statistics.

"Six prisoners have died after a series of jailhouse riots in Italy which were sparked by tough new measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. Inmates set their prison on fire in Modena yesterday in an angry protest over a ban on family visits, unions said. Six inmates are confirmed to have died, including three who had been transferred to different prisons as authorities tried to quell the uprising. Justice ministry sources said two of the deaths in Modena were caused by an overdose from drugs found in the jail infirmaries, while a third prisoner was found blue in the face and their cause of death was still unclear. Police were today clashing with relatives who had gathered outside the jail, in northern Italy which is at the centre of the virus outbreak. The riot was one of several around the country with other disturbances taking place in Salerno, Naples and Milan among others. According to Il Corriere, a group of 60 inmates set fire to the prison in Modena after the tough new measures were announced. Footage broadcast by local media showed police and fire trucks outside the prison as black smoke swirled into the sky. Around 500 people were at risk of escaping until authorities laid siege to the penitentiary and eventually stormed the building. Once inside, they discovered a 'surreal scene and a devastated building', reports say, seizing a supply of drugs. The head of Italy's prison service, Francesco Basentini, said three inmates had at the jail and three others had died after being transferred to other prisons. 'There have been a series of rebellions across the country,' Basentini said in a televised interview. Prison officers' union Sappe said some 80 prisoners had been transferred to other jails after the uprising. 'The inmates that have been moved were those who managed to reach the yard in a bid to escape,' Seppe's secretary general Giovanni Battista Durante said. 'We are told other prisoners inside the jail have barricaded themselves in and probably have illegal weapons'. He said colleagues from the prison had told him the jail had been 'completely destroyed'. Two of the Modena prisoners are believed to have died of drug overdoses, while another was found dead with their skin coloured blue. At least another four inmates are reportedly in hospital in serious conditions, while at leasttwo prison officers were injured. In an emergency decree on Sunday, the government imposed limits on direct contact between inmates and their families. Prisoners will be allowed to contact visitors by phone or other remote methods under the measures, in place until March 22. Rights group Antigone called on authorities to help prisoners communicate with their families, but urged the inmates to keep calm, while wardens called for a crackdown. 'All necessary measures must be taken to reduce tension and,meanwhile, we appeal to all prisoners to stop all violence,' Antigone said yesterday. 'We had already warned tensions were growing in prisons, and that we feared it could end in tragedy,' it said in a statement following the revolts. 'All necessary measures must be taken to ensure prisoners their full rights, stopping this escalation of tension and preventing others from dying. One death is already too much,' it said. Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini said: 'The gates of the prisons shouldn't be thrown open with the excuse of the revolts.' Prisoners also revolted at Naples Poggioreale in the south, Frosinone in central Italy and Alexandria in the north-west, unions said. Similar scenes played out in Padova in the north and Bari, Foggia and Palermo in the south, media reports said. At Frosinone, south of Rome, police had to be called in to restore order after about a hundred prisoners barricaded themselves into a section of the prison. At the Torre del Gallo jail in Pavia, south of Milan, two guards were reportedly taken temporarily hostage, enabling prisoners to steal the keys and release their fellow convicts. Italian media said there were reports of violence against guards and between rival prisoner gangs. At Frosinone, south of Rome, police were called in to restore order after about 100 prisoners barricaded themselves into a section of the prison. The protesting inmates drew up a list of demands, including the right to have visits, and tried to negotiate with the prison management, the Agi news agency reported. Families of some of the inmates at Poggioreale, a suburb of Naples, gathered outside the prison to support them. Sappe said two guards had been taken hostage in the northern city of Pavia and were released after a police raid. The uprisings came as Italy issued new nationwide rules to try and stem the spread of the virus, which has killed 366 people so far and infected 7,375. It is now the second-worst affected country in the world, behind China.",real
"TheDuchess of Sussexlooked resplendent in an emerald green ensemble as she arrived for theCommonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey this afternoon. Meghan Markle, 38, chose an exquisitecaped dress by designer Emilia Wickstead with a matching hat byWilliam Chambers as she joined husband Prince Harry, 35, and senior royals including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the engagement. It marks Harry and Meghan's last official outing as senior members of the royal family before they give up their titles at the end of the month as part of their 'Megxit' departure deal. And the Duchess of Sussex rose to the occasion with her showstopping ensemble, which was widely praised on social media by royal supporters and fashion fans alike within minutes of her arrival. Scroll down for video The elegant, long-sleeved dress is thought to be a bespoke creation by Wickstead, a favourite of both Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge, 38. The fitted long-sleeved dressfalls a few inches below the knee and features cleverly-placed darts on the torso and waistline that serve to flatter the Duchess's svelte frame. A dramatically draped asymmetric cape that falls over the right shoulder adds a fashion-forward twist to the otherwise classic cut. Continuing a recent streak of monochrome looks, Meghan wore a matching green hat with net detailing on the brim and folded in an oversized flower structure on the side. She introduced a contrasting texture with a £1,695 'Demi'satin green bag by socialite designer Gabriel Hearst, worn on previous occasions, and finished the look with a pair of nude heels by favourite footwear designer Aquazzura. When it came to jewellery, Meghan chose her beautiful diamond trio engagement ring and her trusty pair of£6,950 Stowstorm earrings by Canadian designer Birks. Meghan's brunette locks were swept up in a delicate braided bun tied beneath her hat at the nape of her neck. Her make-up consisted of dramatic, dark eyes, defined brows, bronzed cheek and a touch of rose pink lip colour. Prince Harry and Meghan are joining the monarch, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they carry out their last public royal duty before they walk away from the monarchy. But, unlike last year, Harry and Meghan have been conducted to their seats, rather than waiting for the Queen's arrival and walking through the church in London with the monarch and key royals as they did last year. It also emerged today that last-minute changes were made to the royal arrangements, meaning Prince William and Kate, who were due to join the Queen in the procession, were also conducted to their places. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America.",real
"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle plan to set up a charitable organisation to help injured and homeless veterans, it has emerged. The Duke and Duchess reportedly want to set up a new charity to give assistance to former military personnel, both in Britain and the US. The cause is close to their hearts and both feel passionately about doing all they can for those who served in the armed forces. According to the Mirror, the Duke and Duchess of Sussexplan to tacklehomelessness and issues around medical care for ex-service personnel. A source told the paper the couple want to 'collectively make a change in the armed forces arena'. The new planned charity would be the pair's firstventure since announcing they want to move to Canada and set back from royal duties in January. Palace sources said the move to help members of the military would be 'hugely welcomed' by the Queen. On Monday Harry and Meghan will take part in their last official engagement before they step down as working royals at the end of this month. They will stand alongside the Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William and Kate, at the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey. On Sunday Harry and Meghan joined the Queen for a church service in Windsor. It was the first time that Meghan, 38, and the Queen, 93, have seen each other since the bombshell announcement on January 6. Harry and Meghan are currently visiting the UK for a series of final engagements as working royals. The royal couple have left baby Archie at home in Canada which reportedly left the Queen 'disappointed' as she will not get the chance to see her great-grandson again. It is understood Her Majesty wanted to support the royal couple by inviting them to the church service. On Saturday the Duke and Duchessattended the Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall. Prince Harry, 35, who attended the event at the South Kensington venue in his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines, wore a mess dress uniform complete with medals awarded from two tours of Afghanistan. It was the final time that the Duke will go on an engagement in his official Royal Marines capacity, having inherited the rank of Captain General from his 98-year-old grandfather Prince Philip in 2017. The Sussexes received a round of applause and a standing ovation before singing the National Anthem. John Suchet, who was compering the evening, told how 'honoured we are' to have them in attendance. Members of the Royal Marines showcased their musicianship andpageantry during the two-day festival, which is marking the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.",real
"The Duke of Sussex attended church with his wife Meghan and the Queen yesterday to pay tribute to a Royal Marine who died in Afghanistan 13 years ago. Ben Reddy, 22, was killed when K Company of 42 Commando came under fire from militants in the volatile Helmand province on March 6, 2007. And Harry attended a service at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park yesterday in memory of the Marine as a plaque was unveiled in his memory. Marine Reddy lived with his parents Liz and Phil Reddy at their home in Windsor Great Park, where Mr Reddy worked as a gardener for the Queen for many years. Harry, who is Captain General of the Royal Marines and served in Afghanistan soon after Marine Reddy's death, wanted to attend the service, reported The Times. He was close to tears at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Saturday night as he received a long round of applause during his final engagement as Captain General. Wearing a red ceremonial uniform, Harry was visibly moved and appeared to bite his lip upon receiving a standing ovation at the Mountbatten Festival of Music. Following Marine Reddy's death in 2007, the Queen sent a personal message of condolence to his father. Senior royal sources said at the time that the death of Marine Reddy brought into sharp perspective for the Queen the risks of Harry's deployment to Iraq. He was the 51st British serviceman to die in Afghanistan since 2001 and the ninth Marine killed since they took over the main infantry fighting force from the Paras. Marine Reddy, who was said to have been 'particularly close' to his family, died as his unit launched an assault on insurgents near the strategically important Kajaki Dam. The Marines were trying to clear a safe area around the dam, enabling engineers to upgrade a power station, when they came under fire. Marine Reddy had served in Afghanistan for nearly six months and had been due home within weeks. In a statement issued by the Ministry of Defence after their son's death, they said: 'This is the saddest day in our lives. 'Ben's death has left us feeling totally empty. He was, and always will be, our hero.' His comrades in K Company said: 'Ben's absence will be profoundly felt within K Company. We have lost a vibrant, unique character with an irrepressible sense of loyalty to his comrades. But, most of all, we have lost a true friend.' Marine Reddy's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Holmes, said: 'He was rightly very proud of his Green Beret, the outward mark of the Commando soldier. 'However, the real display of his Commando qualities was in his daily actions with K Company, and he had acquitted himself well fighting alongside his colleagues on numerous occasions. 'Courageous and proficient when in contact with the enemy, his fighting spirit was indomitable.' Meghan met the Queen for the first time yesterday since she and Harry announced they are to quit as senior royals. The couple attended the church service in Windsor with Her Majesty as they prepare to leave the royal household in a little over three weeks. They will take part in their final royal engagement today when they will join the Queen and other senior royals at Westminster Abbey to mark Commonwealth Day. It will be the first time the Royal Family has come together in public since the Sussexes announced they were stepping down. Guests of honour among the 2,000-strong congregation will include the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Commonwealth secretary-general Baroness Scotland, high commissioners, ambassadors, faith leaders and more than 800 schoolchildren. Yesterday Harry smiled and appeared relaxed as he drove Meghan to the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park. It was the first time that the duchess has seen the Queen since the couple dramatically announced on January 6 that they would be retiring from public life. While Harry has sat down with the Queen on several occasions since, Meghan has stayed in Canada with their son Archie. But any hopes that she may have had of seeing her great-grandson were dashed because Archie remains on Vancouver Island. The Sussexes are expected to return to Canada next week, and their new life away from royal duties will officially start on April 1. Harry will remain sixth in line to the throne, despite stepping down as a senior royal. The Duke and Duchess will not be part of the Queen's procession through Westminster Abbey at the start of the Commonwealth Service today as they make their final official appearance as senior royals. Harry and Meghan are joining the monarch, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the central London church as they carry out their last public royal duty before they walk away from the monarchy. But, unlike last year, Harry and Meghan will be conducted to their seats, rather than waiting for the Queen's arrival and walking through the church with the monarch and key royals as they did last year. The move signifies their impending exit from The Firm - dubbed Megxit. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America. The Sussexes will arrive after the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who will also be escorted to their seats. The procession will include Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, clergy, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Commonwealth Secretary General, among others, according to the Order of Service. In 2019, Harry and Meghan waited alongside William, Kate, Charles and Camilla for the Queen to arrive, before taking part in The Procession of The Queen. The ceremony - the Sussexes' final public outing in their UK farewell tour - is a poignant milestone as they prepare to embark on their future away from the royal family. On March 31, Meghan will bow out of royal life just one year, 10 months and 12 days - or 682 days - after marrying into the family. She spent almost five years longer appearing on screen in the US drama Suits. The duchess, then Meghan Markle, starred as paralegal Rachel Zane between June 23 2011 and April 25 2018, totalling six years, 10 months and three days, or 2,499 days. The televised service at the Abbey is a key annual event in the calendar for the Queen, who is head of the Commonwealth. But this year's ceremony is likely to be remembered for being Harry and Meghan's royal swansong. Just one year, 10 months and 12 days - or 682 days - after marrying into The Firm, the Duchess of Sussex will be bowing out of royal life completely at the end of the month. The American former actress spent almost five years longer appearing on screen in the US drama Suits. Meghan Markle starred as paralegal Rachel Zane between June 23 2011 and April 25 2018, totalling six years, 10 months and three days, or 2,499 days. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are making their final official public appearance as senior royals at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on Monday. Meghan will have carried out a total of 185 official royal engagements as an HRH. Figures are taken from the Court Circular, but also include her final run of public appearances and a known private engagement in the UK in 2020, which were not listed in the daily record of royal engagements, up until Megxit on March 31. The duchess's time as a senior royal included a period of maternity leave. When the Duke of Edinburgh retired at the age of 96, he had amassed 22,219 solo official engagements since 1952, not including thousands of appearances with the Queen. But Philip is married to the monarch, and Meghan's husband Harry is only sixth in line. A spokeswoman for the couple said, after their appearance at the Abbey, that the Sussexes will hold some private meetings, but there will be no further engagements. Their role supporting the Queen and the monarchy through official appearances will be at an end. The Queen has reportedly told her grandson that the couple are much loved by the royals and would be welcomed back into their roles if they change their minds. Harry and Meghan are heading off to North America to earn their own money, where they are predicted to make millions through ventures such as acting, film or television, brand partnerships, public speaking, and perhaps even book deals. Since their wedding, the Sussexes have carried out four joint overseas tours to Ireland, then Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, followed by Morocco, and then South Africa. Born a prince, Harry has spent his whole life as an HRH, but, after 35 years, six months and 16 days, from March 31, he will no longer use the style. Their goodbye tour - a flurry of appearances in the UK - has including the Endeavour Fund Awards, a military musical festival at the Royal Albert Hall and Meghan's secret visit to a school in Dagenham, east London, to celebrate International Women's Day. Tradition dictates that Harry, who is not a future king, sits with Meghan in the second row of seats behind the Queen, Charles, Camilla, William and Kate during the service. The Commonwealth event will be the first time the duke and duchess have appeared with the royal family since their bombshell 'Megxit' announcement in January. All eyes will be on how the Windsors, particularly the Cambridges and the Sussexes, interact, and the royals will all make their way to the Great West Door together at the end of the service. William and Harry have faced a turbulent time following a rift that began ahead of Harry's wedding to Meghan. Harry said in an ITV documentary filmed during his Africa tour that he and his brother are on 'different paths' and have good and bad days in their relationship. The Duke of York was at the service in 2019, accompanying the Queen as she arrived. But he will be absent this year, having stepped down from public life following his disastrous Newsnight appearance over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Harry and Meghan last appeared alongside the royals four months ago on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph in November. Coverage of the service will be broadcast live on BBC One from 2.15pm, and across the BBC World Service. The Queen in her Commonwealth Day message has praised the diversity of the family of nations whose blend of traditions 'serves to make us stronger'. In her annual message, the head of state highlighted how global connectivity makes people aware their 'choices and actions' can affect the 'well-being of people and communities living far away' - and inspires many to be more careful with natural resources. International boxing champion and Olympic gold medallist Anthony Joshua will deliver a reflection, while singers Alexandra Burke and Craig David will perform. Ahead of their wedding, Harry and Meghan highlighted the Commonwealth as a priority for their royal duties. Harry said: 'Both of us have passions for wanting to make change, change for good, and with lots of young people running around the Commonwealth, that's where we're going to spend most of our time hopefully.' Stepping down as a working royal means Harry must leave his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador. But he will remain president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust and Meghan will still be the Trust's vice-president.",real
"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have started to copyright their Instagram photographs 'The Duke and Duchess of Sussex' following the Queen's decision to ban them from using 'Sussex Royal' in their branding. The couple took to theSussex Royal Instagram account and shared a picture from Saturday,where they joined veterans, serving members, world-class musicians, composers and conductors of the Massed Bands of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines for the annual Mountbatten Festival of Music — an event to help raise funds on behalf of the Royal MarinesCharity. However, there was one subtle difference on their social media page - the copyright of the pictures had changed from previous, with the credit instead being attributed to 'The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.' It was a stark difference to just a week earlier, where a snap of Prince Harrylaunching a new eco-friendly travel firm in Edinburgh had been credited to 'Sussex Royal' - the last time the brand appears to have been used on their Instagram. Harry and Meghan first began using the Sussex Royal branding this time last year, after they split their household from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – known as Kensington Royal. The Sussexes' Instagram page, @sussexroyal, has amassed 11.2million followers – the same number of fans as William and Kate's account. But at the end of February, documents filed at the Intellectual Property Office showed a request to use the names Sussex Royal and Sussex Royal Foundation for commercial and charity activities in the UK had been removed. It followed the Queen's decision that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could not use the 'Royal' label after deciding to step down as working royals and move to North America. A statement they released at the time struck a more hostile tone in some sections, and said that neither the government nor the Queen herself own the word 'royal' internationally - but they would nonetheless stop using the title. The statement read: 'While there is not any jurisdiction by The Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word 'Royal' overseas, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use 'Sussex Royal' or any iteration of the word 'Royal' in any territory (either within the UK or otherwise) when the transition occurs Spring 2020.' Additionally, astatement issued by the palace stated that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer use their HRH titles. Meghan and Harry's statement states, however, that they will keep the prefixes His and Her Royal Highness.",real
"A schoolboy who hugged Meghan Markle after she hosted an event at his school in east London, today said his mother is his real hero for taking care of him and his three brothers. Head boy Aker Okoye received a rapturous applause when he bounded on stage to embrace the Duchess of Sussex during her visit toRobert Clack Upper School in Dagenham on Friday. Aker said his ego 'won't fit through the door' when he returns to school but today admitted that he was 'proud of his mother Shorell who he also said was an 'amazing netball player'. Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, the 16-year-old praised his mother, who also appeared on the show with him. He said: 'My mum is a hero, she takes care of me and my three brothers, she isn't just a mum and she has a life as well, which is usually a stereo type, she is an athlete, she plays netball. Dear Harry and Meghan, Harry, hope you don't mind me writing this letter. I hope you didn't mind me cuddling your wife. I was just overwhelmed and shocked to see her at my school. It was a pleasure to hear her speech and to speak in front of her as well. She is truly inspirational. I nearly met you last year when you came to East London to open the future youth zone but I was away with the school. I hope to meet you one day. Good luck and best for the future. With kind regards, Aker Okoye 'She can do anything and everything, I hope my mum can show other black females that anything is possible.' He added that one of the reasons he chose to get up on stage and talk about International Women's Day was because he felt women's rights had been 'under looked'. 'I was passionate about recognising the strong women in my personal life and giving them recognition, because what I have realised, I am studying history – even my history teacher is a female, what I have realised from looking back is that women's rights and women's struggles have always been a talking point. 'It has always been something important and under looked and not given the right amount of attention. So now that I'm a man and benefit from the patriarch I can at least say I recognise their achievements and I am in awe of their presence.' Piers laughed and told Aker that his ego would be huge after the last few days and Aker claimed: 'I'm not sure if I'll fit in the door when I get back to school today'. Shorell said she was proud of her son and said she wasn't aware Meghan was scheduled to host an event at the school. 'It was a shock, we had a phone call saying she was going to be there, I thought that was lovely but I didn't expect all of this afterwards, but I am not surprised we are here'. Speaking about his speech, Piers joked that Aker decided to start with a one liner. He opened with: 'She really is beautiful innit'. A line which made everyone cheer in the crowd. Watching it back, Aker said he was really embarrassed. Piers said it had been a 'human moment' and asked what Meghan had told the youngster after his joke. Aker: 'She said it was 'very well said''. He then admitted he had penned a handwritten apology to Prince Harry for hugging his wife. 'I didn't want to cause any more controversy, there was an Instagram comment on a post I was on which said if I'm dead in the next six months then we know who's sent the hit out, so I thought I better cover myself'. Susanna then asked Aker what it had been like to get close to the Duchess. 'She was really humble and down to earth', he said. 'She is more than that, she is an amazing person. I was flabbergasted – it was an amazing moment. It was one of those moments that I will cherish for the rest of my life.' 'She is more than a pretty face she is strong committed and I was privileged to be in her presence.' Piers asked Aker what it meant for the black community to have Meghan marry Prince Harry. 'I think it shows we are present and shows us as a caucus, as a group and as a race, it gives us hope and a little bit of drive as well.' His mother said she was pleased Meghan had been in the UK and was 'glad' that she had lived here for the time she had. After meeting Meghan, Aker penned a letter to Prince Harry that read:'Dear Harry and Meghan. Harry, hope you don't mind me writing this letter,' he wrote. 'I hope you didn't mind me cuddling your wife. I was just overwhelmed and shocked to see her arrive at my school. 'It was a pleasure to hear her speech and to speak in front of her as well. She is truly inspirational.' Speaking to The Sun, his fatherErick Okoye, 42, claimed he would be having words with his son after he learnt he had stole a kiss from Meghan. 'He casually told us Meghan had been at the school. He said she was very friendly, and that he'd done a speech too.' 'But he never told me he kissed her! I can't believe it. How cheeky! I hope he didn't get in trouble. Was she OK about it? I hope so!'",real
"Kate Middleton recycled a scarlet 1940s custom made Catherine Walker coat dress for this year's Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey. The Duchess of Cambridge, 38, looked a picture of elegance in the ensemble, which she teamed with a red felt cocktail hat by Sally Ann Provan, as she joined her husband Prince William and other royals at the event. Kate swept her brunette locks into a side bun and completed her outfit with matching red Gianvito Rossi suede heels and a clutch purse. The mother-of-three last wore the double-breasted coat dress by the French-born fashion designer, which has aburgundy velvet collar and sleeves, on Christmas Day at Sandringham in 2018.

Harry, whowore a mess dress uniform complete with medals awarded from two tours of Afghanistan, inherited the rank of Captain General from his 98-year-old grandfather Prince Philip in 2017. Meghan Markle, who arrived at the venue with a huge smile on her face, wore a red full-length £1,295 Safiyaa dress, jewelled Simone Rocha earrings, and gorgeous red Stuart Weitzman heels. The Sussexes received a round of applause and a standing ovation before singing the National Anthem. John Suchet, compering the evening, told how 'honoured we are' to have the pair in attendance. Harry and Meghan took their seats in the royal box in the astounding 5,272-capacity concert hall, which was commissioned and opened by Queen Victoria in 1871 for her late husband Prince Albert. 'An emotional moment for Harry. Look at him squeezing Meghan's hand,'commented one, while a second wrote: 'This is so sweet, I’m in tears!' A third added: 'Gotta love how affectionate they are to one another,' while a fourth penned: 'What a moment! Touching!' A further added: 'I watched their hands the whole time. Beautiful how you can see the support just in how they hold hands!' The royal couple had the opportunity to laugh and joke with uniformed band members and dancers backstage, before heading onto the stage to meet more attendees and musicians. They walked off stage hand in hand, and went to take their seats for the second part of the show. During the performance, the audience were led in a singalong of Sir Tom Jones hits including Delilah and It's Not Unusual. The concert also featured Judy Garland classic Over the Rainbow, and the Gladiator film theme.",real
"Hope Hicks has packed up her life in Los Angeles to return to the political circuit in Washington D.C., DailyMailTV can disclose. The former Trump staffer announced she would be returning to work at the White House on February 12 but no mention was made of the date. Now DailyMailTV can exclusively reveal the 31-year-old was seen getting a fresh haircut, boxing up her things and moving out of her $6,145-per-month rented Brentwood apartment last week. Exclusive photos show movers arriving at the luxury apartment block early in the morning before spending the day packing her possessions into a U-Haul bound for D.C. – all overseen by Hicks who was seen chatting with the workmen. DailyMailTV understands Hicks has spent her final few days on the West Coast holed up inside the luxury Intercontinental in the Century City neighborhood, where rooms start at $276 per night. Hicks has been living in Los Angeles since November 2018 when she became Chief Communications Officer at Fox and relocated from D.C. The move came six months after she dramatically quit her job as Director of Communications for the Trump administration – and shortly after she split from ex-boyfriend Rob Porter, 42. In January 2018, he had been forced to resign from his role as White House Staff Secretary after DailyMail.com revealed his alleged history of domestic abuse. Neither Hicks nor Porter have ever commented on the allegations or their relationship but they are thought to have split shortly before she left for a new life on the West Coast. At the time, friends said she was hoping for a fresh start but sources have since claimed Hicks was not cut out for life in LA and found the slow pace of the job at Fox dull after the White House. DailyMailTV can reveal that she has made few friends in the fiercely Democrat city – but has forged relationships with a handful of new people, among them United Talent Agency boss and Clinton donor Jay Sures, 53, with whom she has been seen several times. She also joined the movie boss for a SuperBowl party in February 2019 at his lavish Beverly Hills home. Instead, her life has largely consisted of work along with early morning workouts at Barry's Bootcamp in Venice Beach as well as regular visits to Brentwood's panoply of upmarket coffee shops – most made alone. Her return, which was announced last month, comes as President Trump steps up preparations for his re-election campaign which now looks set to see him pitted against Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. Hicks is understood to be a favorite of Trump – who has nicknamed her 'Hopester' – and is one of the few White House staffers to have left her role of her own volition. In her new advisor role, she will be working closely with Jared Kushner who released a statement shortly after the announcement in which he said the administration is 'excited' to have her back. He continued: 'There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks. We are excited to have her back on the team.' Since the news of her return to the White House was announced, Hicks has been keeping a low profile and has spent much of the past two weeks tying up loose ends in her old role at Fox, sources told DailyMailTV. She did, however, take a couple of days off to relax with her mother Caye, 63, and Mary Grace, 33, who flew in from Connecticut to sight see in LA. Although Hicks stayed at home while her family took in the sights of Beverly Hills, she was spotted with them enjoying a quiet dinner at a popular Santa Monica taco joint. A clearly happy Hicks was seen laughing over dinner at Prima Baja Cocina, a fashionable Mexican famous for its seafood. The 31-year-old is due to start back at the White House early this month.",real
"Conservatives were up in arms after Twitter labeled a video of Joe Biden shared by the White House's Director of Social Media Dan Scavino 'manipulated media.' On Saturday, Scavino shared a video clip of 'Sleepy Joe' Biden speaking in St. Louis, Missouri where he fumbles over the word of his speech and eventually says, 'We can only re-elect Donald Trump.' The video is shortened so that the rest of Biden's point is cut off: 'We can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here.' 'It’s got to be a positive campaign,' the former vice president said. Last month, Twitter rolled out a new 'synthetic and manipulated media policy' and the company said it would start enforcing the policy on March 5. The policy warns that content may be labeled if it is 'significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated' or 'shared in a deceptive manner.' If the content is likely to 'impact public safety or cause serious harm' the policy allows for Twitter to remove the content. The policy is supposed to inform users when they're looking at deepfakes. Deepfakes are digitally altered videos where technology is used to literally put words in someone else's mouth. A spokesperson for Twitter confirmed to DailyMail.com that Scavino's video was labeled based on the new policy. This is the first tweet where the label has been applied. And due to a technical error, the 'manipulated media' warning isn't showing up every time it's shared. Twitter is working on a fix. Scavino and a number of conservative allies have protested that the video clip was labeled this way. 'The video was NOT manipulated,' Scavino tweeted. The video was not a deepfake, but it was edited in such a way that it took the former vice president's comments out of context. Scavino also agreed '100%' that Twitter was setting a 'dangerous precedent' by calling his clip manipulated. Benny Johnson, the chief creative officer for the young conservative group Turning Point USA, argued the 'video was simply shortened.' 'That means every clip on Twitter is ""manipulated,""' Johnson argued. Brendan Carr, a Trump-appointed commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in. '""Disinformation"" is the new disinformation,' he argued. 'We’re seeing an intentional and coordinated effort by established gatekeepers to equate political speech they don’t like with the entirely separate categories of doctored deep fakes, illegal content, and deceptive cheap fakes,' he tweeted Sunday night in reference to Scavino's tweet.",real
"People close to Joe Biden have begun discussing how to fill a potential cabinet – with big names from Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg on the list, alongside some prominent bankers. The talk of a potential Biden administration comes as the former vice president continues to mop up endorsements – although he still faces key tests against Sen. Bernie Sanders, including primaries on Tuesday March 10. Among those being talked about for a top post is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been mentioned as a possible Treasury secretary. Warren launched her own failed campaign with a call for economic populism and regulating big banks and corporations. She has yet to endorse in the campaign, and she also could be a potential vice presidential pick, in particular if Biden decides he needs to shore up support on his left flank after a long campaign against Sanders. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who dropped out and endorsed Biden after spending hundreds of millions on his own campaign, is a top possibility for running the World Bank, Axiosreports. Two prominent bank executives made the list, even at at time when Biden was under fire from the Sanders camp for taking campaign funds from billionaires. Among them isJPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, a billionaire who leads the nation's largest bank. Dimon was listed as a possible Treasury pick, as wasAnne Finucane, the vice chairman of Bank of America. Dimon is expecting a full recovery after doctors last week did an emergency procedure to repair an acute aortic dissection, a heart procedure. During the campaign, Warren and others hit Biden for taking steps while serving in the Senate to cater to the big banks that hold sway in Delaware, which Biden represented and where many institutions are incorporated. Biden was a top backer of the 2005 bankruptcy law. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who is still stumping for Biden and who campaigned for him in New Hampshire, is described as eager to take a post dealing with climate change and open to returning as secretary of state. Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, who was fired by President Trump after telling subordinates not to defend an executive order on immigration, could be a leading candidate for attorney general if Biden wins the White House. Biden faces Sanders in Michigan, Washington, Missouri, and other states Tuesday",real
"Donald Trump Jr challenged Hunter Biden to 'man up' and debate him over who has benefited most from their fathers' time in office. In an interview for Axios on HBO Sunday night, and later on Twitter, the president's eldest son offered the former Vice President's son the opportunity to settle the score over who is better off from their father's position.  Trump Jr offered Axios's co-founder Jim Vandehei the opportunity to 'moderate a debate between Hunter Biden and myself'. 'We can go full transparency,' Trump Jr added. 'We show everything, and we can talk about allof the places where I’m supposedly grifting, but Hunter Biden isn’t.' Since President Donald Trump came to power in 2016, Hunter's links to Ukraine have been routinely criticised, with allegations of the former Vice President using his son to remove a prosecutor. Later on Twitter, Trump Jr wrote: 'The [mainstream media] loves making a false equivalency between us, so let’s settle it: 'I challenge Hunter Biden to man up & debate me. 'Hunter releases his tax returns & I release mine. 'Let’s have an open [conversation] about who really profited from their father’s public office! During the interview, Trump Jr is much more clear on how he thinks Hunter benefited from his father. 'His father becomes VP. All of a sudden he goes over to Ukraine and he’s making 83 grand a month,' Trump Jr. said. In the interview, Trump Jr said that he has not benefited from his father's position. He insisted that paid speeches and recently published political books are sources of income that he had before his father became president. Hunter's business dealings have long been criticised by politicians. In May 2014, he became a board member of Ukrainian Burisma Holdings, while his father was Vice President for Barack Obama. While Joe gave details about his threat to withhold $1billionin loan guarantees if Viktor Shokin - a prosecutor accused of corruption - wasn't fired, there was no individual investigation into the former VP's son. Ukraine's prosecutor general has announced there was no evidence that Hunter or Joe did anything wrong. But, the suspicions raised have been employed by the Trump administration to obscure the president's own communications with Ukraine. ",real
"Joe Biden has soared to lead over Bernie Sanders in new polls heading into the next round of Democratic primaries and won the endorsement of former rival Cory Booker on Monday. 'The answer to hatred & division is to reignite our spirit of common purpose. @JoeBiden won’t only win - he’ll show there's more that unites us than divides us. He’ll restore honor to the Oval Office and tackle our most pressing challenges. That’s why I’m proud to endorse Joe,' Booker wrote on Twitter. The New Jersey senator is the latest moderate Democrat and 10th former presidential contender to line up behind Biden in his bid to stop Sanders. Additionally, Biden garnered a double-digit lead over Sanders in a new CNN poll, with 52 per cent choosing the former vice president and 36 per cent wanting the Vermont senator as their nominee. Biden is campaigning in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday and will hold a rally with Kamala Harris in Detroit tonight. Sanders is holding a campaign rally in St. Louis and will hold a coronavirus roundtable in Detroit. Momentum appears to be on Biden's side as six states prepare to vote on Tuesday with 352 delegates at stake: Michigan, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho and North Dakota. Michigan is the biggest prize with 125 delegates. Michigan, Washington and Missouri make up 80 per cent of the delegates at stake. Sanders has put his effort in Michigan, which he won in 2016 in a shock victory over Hillary Clinton, and in Washington state. Losses there would damage his campaign headed into the next round of primaries on March 17. Biden lead in two recent polls in Washington state but was within the margin of error. Sanders won the state's caucuses in 2016 but when Washington state held a non-binding primary election later that year, Clinton was the victor. The state will hold a primary instead of a caucus on Tuesday.  Biden continues to round up support among party officials, with former rival Kamala Harris endorsing him on Sunday. 'I believe in Joe. I really believe in him and I have known him for a long time. One of the things that we need right now is we need a leader who really does care about the people and who can therefore unify the people. And I believe Joe can do that,' the California senator said in a video announcing her endorsement. She also noted she'll be in Detroit Monday night to campaign for Biden ahead of Michigan's primary on Tuesday. Harris delivered a near knock-out punch to Biden in the first Democratic primary debate in June of last year, after she told the story of a little girl who benefited from a federal school program and ended it by dramatically declaring: 'That girl was me.' Her campaign jumped in the polls and brought in millions but she wasn't able to sustain that moment and dropped out in December. Despite the battle with Biden in that debate, the former vice president spoke favorably of her and even said he'd consider her as his running mate. FOR JOE BIDEN Cory Booker Kamala Harris Amy Klobuchar Pete Buttigieg Michael Bloomberg Beto O'Rourke Deval Patrick John Delaney Tim Ryan Seth Moulton FOR BERNIE SANDERS Bill de Blasio Marianne Williamson Biden has raked in the endorsements from his former rivals. But there is one notable exception: Elizabeth Warren.The Massachusetts senator has not said who she'll support for president. Warren could play a kingmaker role in the primary - her support of Biden could bring some of the liberal left to his side, which would hurt Sanders. But if she endorses Sanders, it could lock up the left wing of the party in a battle against the more moderate wing that favors Biden. Sanders is also campaigning hard into Tuesday, appearing on four Sunday shows and touting out his own slate of powerhouse supporters. On Sunday he announced the endorsement of Jesse Jackson, who won Michigan in his 1988 presidential campaign. The legendarycivil rights leader campaigned with Sanders in Grand Rapids on Sunday. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez held a rally with Sanders in Detroit on Sunday night. Sanders would like to repeat his win there and reclaim the frontrunner status from Biden, who surged ahead in the Democratic primary after a strong showing in the Super Tuesday contests. But he said if he loses the state in Tuesday's primary he's not dropping out of the primary race. 'I certainly would not consider dropping out,' he said on 'Fox News Sunday.' Sanders said on Sunday that he would not linger in the race if it couldn't be warned but he also noted the next two Tuesdays have big states voting. 'Look, we will fight for every vote that we can, as we’re -- as we try to win this election. I’m not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won,' he said on ABC's 'This Week.' 'But right now, that's a little bit premature. Let's not determine what will happen on Tuesday, what will happen in future,' he said. 'We have a long, long way to go to the Democratic nomination and we're going to fight for every vote that we can get,' Sanders noted. Sanders on Sunday also accused Democratic Party officials of putting pressure on Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar to drop out of the presidential race to endorse Joe Biden as he vowed to keep on campaigning during coronavirus fears. The Vermont Senator has long argued establishment Democrats are against his campaign, going back to the 2016 race when party officials admitted they were helping Hillary Clinton win the nomination. But now he's arguing they pressured fellow contenders to endorse Biden in order to deny Sanders the chance to face President Donald Trump t his fall. 'The establishment put a great deal of pressure on Pete Buttigieg, on Amy Klobuchar who ran really aggressive campaigns. Well, I know both of them. They work really, really hard. But suddenly right before Super Tuesday they announced their withdrawal,' Sanders told NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'If they had not withdrawn from the race before Super Tuesday, which is kind of a surprise to a lot of people, I suspect we would have won in Minnesota, we would have won in Maine, we would have won in Massachusetts. The turnout may have been a little bit different,' he noted. Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg, and Beto O'Rourke have all endorsed Biden. The Minnesota senator - along with Buttigieg - exited the race before the Super Tuesday contests and endorsed the former vice president, a move which boosted him in those contests. Biden won the most states although Sanders took the biggest prize of the night - the state of California. Klobuchardenied she was pressured to exit the Democratic primary to endorseBiden and said there is no conspiracy among moderate Democrats to stop Sanders' from becoming the nominee. The Minnesota senator told NBC's 'Today Show' last week she left the contest because it was 'the right thing to do.' 'There literally was no push from anyone. It was a decision I made,' she said.

"A Chinese passenger has been tackled by a plane's cabin crew after she allegedly coughed at flight attendants on purpose amid coronavirus outbreak. The unidentified woman was infuriated while being held on board for nearly seven hours waiting for health checks after theThai Airways flight landed at the Shanghai Pudong Airport last Friday. The female passenger is seen in a video being restrained by a male cabin crew member after she began coughing at one of the air stewardesses. A staff member can be heard saying in Thai, 'come here, help me put her down' before telling his colleague to 'get handcuffs', according to reports. The woman screams 'what did I do wrong' while another flight attendant tells her to 'please stay down'. The airline confirmed the incident in a post on their official Weibo page and said the local airport has recently intensified the level of coronavirus checks, particularly for passengers travelling from high-risk countries. Prathana Pattanasiri, Vice President of aviation safety department at Thai Airways, said the cabin crew couldn't open the plane doors until health officials arrived to carry out the screening tests. 'The Chinese passenger was upset about being held for a long time and coughed at one of our staff members. After she calmed down, we explained the situation to her and she agreed to sit and wait for the screening.' The footage was uploaded on YouTube by a passenger who claimed to have been on the four-hour flight TG664 from Bangkok. The description of the video said it was a 'bureaucratic, dysfunctional mess at Pudong airport' that was 'caused by planes having to wait six to ten hours at the gate after landing with all passengers still on board'. 'One Chinese woman went stir crazy on a Thai Airways flight and deliberately coughed on a female flight attendant to try to pressure the staff to open the doors and let her out. 'Senior male flight attendant was having none of it, warned her, then a scuffle ensued. He was going to put her in cuffs, but eventually chose not to,' the fellow passenger added. The screening process at the Shanghai airport has been sped up since the incident, according to the social media post from Thai Airways. The novel coronavirus, which is believed to escalate in Wuhan, has killed 3,119 people in China and infected over 80,700 people. Worldwide, the deadly disease has infected over 110,000 people and claimed at least 3,825 deaths. Italy has been the most-affected country in Europe, with the death toll rising to 366. An outbreak started on British soil last week and a third person died on Sunday – more than 270 people have already been infected and there are no signs officials will be able to contain the virus from spreading more in the coming days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is today hosting a Cobra meeting of senior Government ministers to discuss how best to tackle the deadly outbreak. It comes after sources inside Number 10 last week said officials believe the virus 'ishighly likely that it is going to spread in a significant way'. The British Foreign Office has advised against 'all but essential travel' to a number of areas in northern Italy as total cases reach more than 7,000. It warned citizens to avoid traditional tourist hotspots such as Venice and Milan due to control and isolation measures imposed by Italian authorities and cases of coronavirus reported. Rome has already placed the Lombardy region, with a population of 16million, on lock-down. It comes as UK employers are also reported to be sending employees that have recently travelled to Italy home for a two-week isolation period. The Foreign Office warned against all travel to the Lombardy region alongside the provinces of Emilia Romagna and Piemonte. It also warned against visiting Pesaro e Urbino in Marche and Treviso and Venice in the Veneto region. It first warned against travel to eleven towns in northern Italy on February 25 after 322 coronavirus cases were reported.",real
"The chairman of the American Conservative Union has revealed that he interacted with a 55-year-old man infected with coronavirus before shaking hands with Donald Trump. Matt Schlapp said he feels 'healthy as a horse' after the 'incidental contact' with the man who is now recovering in New Jersey following the event in Washington DC from February 27 to March 1. Texas Republican Ted Cruz has admitted that he also shook hands with the infected man and has put himself into 14-day quarantine. 'Last night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for COVID-19,' Cruz said in a statement Sunday. 'That interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.' On Sunday, Arizona Republican Paul Gosar joined Cruz by self-quarantining. 'I am announcing that I, along with three of my senior staff, are officially under self-quarantine after sustained contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus.' It comes as the US coronavirus death toll climbed to 22 with another patient dying in Washington state.Grant County Health District confirmed the death without giving further details. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Schlapp was seen interacting with the likes of Ivanka Trump, Lara Trump and Jared Kushner at the event last week where he also came into contact with the infected person. 'I had incidental contact with him, very briefly... I feel healthy as a horse,'Schlapp told Fox Sunday. Schlapp said he had contacted anyone who may have had contact with the infected individual but said that person 'had no contact with either the president or the vice president'. 'I can tell you, when the president was on site at CPAC, he lives by what he tells us, because I saw him scrub down his hand and clean his hands more than once while he was on the premises, and I did the same,' Schlapp said. He added in a tweet Sunday night: 'We did ask the patient the names of everyone he spent time with. Those who interacted with the attendee were informed. The good news is NO ONE has any symptoms.' War Room podcast host Raheem Kassam said he was around the infected man and had been 'flu-sick unwell for the past week'. He claimed the infected man was around for most of the Thursday activities and noting that Gosar and Cruz were in the green room 1pm to 5pm that day, Kassam said the likes of Rep Louie Gohmert, KellyAnne Conway and Rep Matt Gaetz may be at risk. Kassam said the infected person was around on the Friday too. 'Everyone at the CPAC Shabbat dinner should be checked. The attendee was there,' Kassam tweeted Sunday. He alleged there could be a second infected person.Kassam said he and others were 'apoplectic about how they have not been better informed of what happened'. As of Sunday evening, 550 people in the US had tested positive for COVID-19 and 22 people had died. Globally 110,037 people have tested positive for coronavirus and and 3,825 people have died. President Trump previously said he's not concerned about any risk.  Cruz, however, said in his statement that he's cutting himself off from further public interaction despite medics believing he's not a risk. He also said he's notified other politicians who attended CPAC. 'I have consulted with medical authorities from the Houston Health Department, the Harris County Public Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as my personal physician,' he tweeted. 'I have also spoken with Vice President Pence, Leader McConnell, and Mark Meadows.' Cruz spoke with Michael Knowles on February 28. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel joined them to discuss the party's 2020 strategy. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for 15 minutes on Monday because stocks tumbled so drastically in the first few moments of trading as a result of global coronavirus panic and an oil price war sparked by Saudi Arabia. The Dow opened on a loss of more than 1700 points on Monday, a decrease of more than seven percent since Friday's close, after a chaotic weekend which saw oil prices tumble and which all but decimated the futures market. Circuit breakers - which are rarely triggered but exist to stop prices tumbling further when a downward spiral shows no sign of slowing - went into effect on Sunday night to stop some futures trading at astronomically low prices. They were triggered again on Monday morning after a dramatic start to the day's trading to stop the markets going into free-fall. At 9.50am, the Dow re-opened but it had slipped, losing 2,000 points in total. If prices drop to 13 percent from Friday's close, trading will stop for another 15 minutes. Then, it will take for them to drop by 20 percent to stop for another 15 minutes. Monday's opening marked the worst decrease on Wall Street for more than 10 years. 'I'm not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy,' Cruz tweeted. 'Given that the interaction was 10 days ago, that the average incubation period is 5-6 days, that the interaction was for less than a minute, and that I have no current symptoms, the medical authorities have advised me that the odds of transmission from the other individual to me were extremely low. 'The physicians further advised that testing is not effective before symptoms manifest, and my brief interaction with the individual does not meet the CDC criteria for self-quarantine.' Cruz reassured those who have come into contact with him recently that they should not be worried. However, he has opted to stay at home for two weeks as an extra measure. 'The medical authorities explicitly advised me that, given the above criteria, the people who have interacted with me in the 10 days since CPAC should not be concerned about potential transmission,' Cruz said. 'Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because of how frequently I interact with my constituents as a part of my job and to give everyone peace of mind, I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, until a full 14 days have passed since the CPAC interaction. 'Everyone should continue to treat this outbreak seriously and be driven by facts and medical science. 'We need to continue to be proactive in mobilizing resources to combat this outbreak-including the $8.3 billion in emergency funding we provided last week-and I encourage everyone to follow the recommendations of the CDC and other health professionals in protecting their own health and welfare, as well as the health and welfare of those around them.' Maryland officials had warned on Saturday that a person who attended the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in the suburb of Oxon Hill had tested positive for the virus. The person was not identified and was only described as a 55-year-old man from Englewood, New Jersey. The individual was recovering at a New Jersey hospital this weekend. Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the conference. Despite Schlapp saying he had contact with the individual before shaking hands with Trump, the White House said Saturday there was no indication that either had met or were in 'close proximity' to the infected attendee. Thousands of employees at the resort where the event took place have undergone screening. The department of health said it wasn't restricting movements as no one had reported illness.The department encouraged attendees to check their temperature twice a day. 'The Maryland Department if Health has responded to our Gaylord Hotel corona situation w speed and skill. We thank them for their competence. It will save much needless anguish,'Schlapp said on Sunday. Meanwhile, when Trump was asked whether his campaign rallies would would continue in light of the CPAC case, the president said: 'We´ll have tremendous rallies.' Trump held his most recent campaign rally last Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina. He waved off other questions to join a dinner for the president of Brazil, who was visiting Trump at the president's home in south Florida. More than half of all U.S. states have reported cases of the coronavirus, which originated in China last year. The US death toll from the disease is currently at 22 with the majority being from Washington state following an outbreak at a nursing home just outside Seattle. An increase in testing across the country has seen a jump in confirmed cases in Washington state, New York and California. Official in Missouri say one of its confirmed cases is a 20-year-old woman who traveled from Chicago to St. Louis via Amtrak. She had returned to the US from Italy where she was studying abroad. It comes as a Marine at Fort Belvoir inVirginia was the first military case of coronavirus reported inside the U.S., according to a Pentagon official. The Marine was being treated at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, located south of Washington, and had recently returned from an overseas assignment. Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, director of epidemiology and population health for the Fairfax County health department, said the Fairfax man developed systems of respiratory illness on February 28 and was hospitalized on March 5. He remains hospitalized but is in stable condition and not in an intensive care unit. 'Fortunately, the individual had limited contact with others while ill, and therefore the risk to the general Fairfax community remains low,' said the county's health director, Dr. Gloria Addo-Ayensa. Virginia state epidemiologist Dr. Lilian Peake said testing for the Fort Belvoir case was done at Walter Reed medical center, and testing for the Fairfax resident was done at a state lab in Richmond. 'The two cases are not related,' Peake said. 'At this point, there are no signs of the virus spreading in the community in Virginia.' In a separate case of coronavirus, a prominent Episcopal church in Washington, D.C., suspended all activities after announcing that one of its senior leaders was the first person in the nation's capital to test positive for the virus. The Rev. Timothy Cole, the rector of Christ Church Georgetown, was in stable condition after being hospitalized Saturday night, according to a statement from the Rev. Crystal Hardin, the assistant rector. Health officials said Sunday said they had determined as part of their investigation that 'an individual's visitation to Christ Church Georgetown warrants precautionary measures' and they recommended a temporary halt to services. In response, the church publicly identified Cole as the victim. Trump said he wasn't concerned 'at all' about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House after the first Washington case was confirmed and officials said an attendee of a recent political conference in the capital where Trump himself had spoken also tested positive for the virus. 'No, I'm not concerned at all. No, I'm not. We've done a great job,' Trump said. Federal and state officials in California were preparing Monday to receive thousands of people from a cruise ship that has been idling off the coast of San Francisco with at least 21 people aboard infected with the coronavirus. Fences were being installed at an 11-acre site at the Port of Oakland, as authorities readied flights and buses to whisk the2,421 passengers aboard the Grand Princess to military bases or their home countries for a 14-day quarantine. The ship, linked to California's first death from COVID-19, will then leave with the remaining 1,094 crew, who are mostly foreign nationals, quarantined on board. It is expected the process will take up to three days. 'We're making every effort to get them off the ship as safely and quickly as possible,' said Dr. John Redd of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, who urged passengers to remain in their rooms. On Sunday, the U.S. State Department issued an advisory against travel on cruise ships, particularly for travelers with underlying health conditions. The statement said the CDC noted an 'increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment.' California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought to reassure the public that none of the Grand Princess passengers would be exposed to the U.S. public before completing the quarantine. The number of infections in the United States climbed above 500 as testing for the virus increased. The 75-year-old male passenger who traveled on the Grand Princess and died from the virus was infected before he came on board the quarantined vessel, the medical officer on the vessel said Sunday. The origins of the infection have left the fate of the ship in question as public health officials deal with a dozen cases of the virus in California linked to passengers who were on board traveling to Mexico last month, including the man who died. It comes asThe Regal Princess cruise ship pulled into a Florida port late Sunday night, after being held off Florida's coast for hours while awaiting results for two crew members who eventually tested negative for coronavirus. The Regal Princess was originally to have docked Sunday morning in Port Everglades but instead spent most of the day sailing up and down the coast. The Coast Guard delivered testing kits to the Regal Princess and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a 'no-sail order' for the ship. The crew members in question had transferred more than two weeks ago from the Grand Princess cruise ship. A Port of Everglades spokeswoman, Ellen Kennedy, said later Sunday that the CDC had cleared the ship to enter port. A Princess Cruises statement issued early Monday said the CDC issued the clearance after the test results came back negative. The Port of Oakland was chosen for docking because of its proximity to an airport and a military base, Newsom said. U.S. passengers will be transported to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia, where they'll be tested for the COVID-19 virus and quarantined. About 1,100 crew on the ship, 19 of whom have tested positive for the new virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere, Newsom said. 'That ship will turn around - and they are currently assessing appropriate places to bring that quarantined ship - but it will not be here in the San Francisco Bay,' he said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health's infectious diseases chief, said Sunday that widespread closure of a city or region, as Italy has done, is 'possible.' U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done in the Seattle, Washington, area amid an outbreak at a care home that has killed 17. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency Sunday because of the virus. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital – with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus – and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers – so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS – the virus that ripped across China in 2003 – which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESN’T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives – which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month – particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone – with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it – 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 – but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions – such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems – are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten – and if children do get the virus it’s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms –particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area – are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms – such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready. As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, health experts advise plane travelers to sit in a window seat, disinfect their table trays and window blinds, and warn that wearing a mask won't prevent infection. Officials say the best way to avoid catching the virus, which is spread through viral particles within mucus or saliva, is to keep your hands clean, disinfect your space, and avoid touching your face. It is also advised that plane travelers choose a window seat to have less contact with potentially sick people. 'Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,' Vicki Stover Hertzberg, professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, said. Hertzberg helped conduct a study that followed passengers and crew members on 10 three to five-hour flights during the flu season and found that passengers who sit in the window seats had less contact with ill people. Wearing a mask on the plane may not prove helpful as the air in the aircraft is considered sterile because there are so few microorganisms at such a high altitude and the plane draws fresh air from the outside. About 50 percent of the air in cabins is recirculated but it goes through sophisticated air filters similar to those used in surgical environments, before it's its pushed back into the plane. A problem with paper masks is that they don't have a respirator to filter out infectious air articles. That means passengers are more likely to catch the virus through direct contact from someone with the virus or surfaces rather than through the air. But one study found that the other coronaviruses - such as SARS and MERS - remains on metal, glass, and plastic surfaces for up to nine days. Top tips include: - Good hand hygiene: Frequently wash hands for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitzer - Disinfect your space: Bring your own wipes and wipe down window blinds, seat belts, arm rests, touch screens and tray tables - Choose a window seat: Sit near the window and avoid moving around the cabin to limit exposure to potentially sick people - Use touch screen with a tissue: Avoid contact with surfaces that may hold the virus - Avoid touching your face: 2019-nCov is spread through viral particles in mucus or saliva. Avoid touching your face and transferring germs picked up from surfaces",real
"The wife of the New York lawyer who was diagnosed with coronavirusis speaking out on the ordeal saying the rest of the family is healthy and they're 'hopeful' for his full recovery. Lawrence Garbuz, a 50-year-old attorney from Westchester County, was hospitalized with the contagious disease on February 27 and has infected his children, wife, neighbor, a friend and other family member with the virus. His wife Adina Lewis Garbuz shared a statement on Sunday saying no one in her family is sick besides her husband and no one has showed signs of infection other than a 'slight cough'. 'We would have preferred this all remain private but since it is no longer, I wanted to at least share some truths and allay people’s fears. Other than Lawrence no one else in my family has been sick other than a slight cough,' she shared in a lengthy Facebook post. 'As for my husband, while he still remains critical, I and my family remain very hopeful of his full recovery. 'He is a tenacious person in all aspects of his life and I know he will come out of this strong. He is a very caring, hardworking person who constantly cares for his clients and those around him over himself. I think it is from this that he was run down and susceptible to the illness he acquired,' she added. Lawrence is currently hospitalized at the Intensive Care Unit at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan's Upper West Side. She urged New Yorkers to 'learn from this and take a moment to take care of yourself', adding 'nothing can be more important than our health'. Garbuz is a partner with the Lawrence and Garbuz law firm, where he worked with his wife. The firm is located across the street from Grand Central Terminal and specializes in wealth management, estate litigation, guardianship and elder law, according to its website. 'As for our law firm, Lewis and Garbuz, as soon as I was made aware of the diagnosis, I personally immediately contacted everyone in our firm and all were quarantined. All have been working remotely ever since. No one is commuting into the Manhattan office and no one will be until we have clearance to do so,' Garbuz said. She said that when she first realized that her husband tested positive for coronavirus, she knew her family's life would be upended. 'When I first heard that Lawrence was positive, I immediately recognized there was going to be pandemonium all around us,' she said. Soon after she and her kids, a 14-year-old and 20-year-old, tested positive for the virus. 'Other than offering what I could to stop this from spreading further, all I and my family care about is that my husband/their father get better,' she said. 'We shuttered the windows, turned off the internet and together stayed strong and in good spirits. I am incredibly blessed that my children while still relatively young have the wisdom to know to keep their heads clear and focus only on the important, the health of their dad and those around us,' she added. She noted that she and her family have been actively cooperating with several Departments of Health and they're thankful for their friends and cooperative neighbors. 'I would also like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of you for the outpouring of love from literally around the world and in particular members of my community who in their own way, many but not all of whom are under quarantine, are living this surreal life with us.' Garbuz's diagnosis is linked to an outbreak of the virus in Westchester County. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the disease spread from the lawyer to his family and other people close to him in New Rochelle, a suburb north of New York City. Garbuz had recently returned to New York from a trip to Miami before he was diagnosed. He marked the first case of community spread of the coronavirus in New York. By Friday at least 28 people who had direct or indirect contact with Garbuz tested positive for coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China around late December to early January. Temple Young Israel of New Rochelle, a synagogue in Westchester County, told congregants to self-quarantine last week as they may have been exposed to the deadly virus through Garbuz. The synagogue has been temporarily closed as other congregants and the rabbi tested positive for the illness. As of Sunday the coronavirus death till in the US hit 21 after two new deaths were reported in Washington state. As of Saturday night there were a total of 89 cases of coronavirus in New York state leading Cuomo to declare a state of emergency. On Sunday Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city has 13 confirmed coronavirus cases, seven of which were diagnosed within the last three days. He warned the city could see at least 100 or more confirmed cases over the next two or three weeks. 'We have to be prepared for that reality,' de Blasio said. There are 516 confirmed cases of coronavirus, dubbed COVID-19, in the US as of Sunday afternoon, scattered across 33 states, the District of Columbia and two cruise ships. Dear all, I am speaking to you wearing two hats- as wife of Lawrence Garbuz and as partner of our law firm, Lewis and Garbuz, P.C. We would have preferred this all remain private but since it is no longer, I wanted to at least share some truths and allay people’s fears. Other than Lawrence no one else in my family has been sick other than a slight cough. When I was first informed of the positive result, I and my entire family immediately provided any and all information to several Departments of Health well into the wee hours of the night in hopes of letting this all be contained as quickly as possible for all of us. We all together pray and hope for the safety and good health of everyone. My family has continued to provide all information requested to best assist in curtailing this epidemic. As for my husband, while he still remains critical, I and my family remain very hopeful of his full recovery. He is a tenacious person in all aspects of his life and I know he will come out of this strong. He is a very caring hardworking person who constantly cares for his clients and those around him over himself. I think it is from this that he was run down and susceptible to the illness he acquired. So, I ask all of us who are running on the hamster wheel of life, particularly us New Yorkers, to learn from this and take a moment to take care of yourself. We should use this an opportunity to re-calibrate and de-stress. Nothing can be more important than our health. From a young child, all Lawrence has ever wanted to be was a lawyer that worked hands on helping people. He is a brilliant attorney who is particularly sensitive to his clients but whose expertise is coming up with creative solutions to trusts and estates issues such as planning for those with disabilities, family disputes, tax issues and the like. He is admired by many judges for the same reason. He is a mentor to many in his field and spends much of his day answering colleagues’ questions. Yet, he is a very humble person who never touts his many successes in his professional world. You would never hear this from him. I only share this now as so much is being said about him already. As for our law firm, Lewis and Garbuz, as soon as I was made aware of the diagnosis, I personally immediately contacted everyone in our firm and all were quarantined. All have been working remotely ever since. No one is commuting into the Manhattan office and no one will be until we have clearance to do so. I would also like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of you for the outpouring of love from literally around the world and in particular members of my community who in their own way, many but not all of whom are under quarantine, are living this surreal life with us. We have wonderful friends who have cared for us despite the running fears all around us. They know who they are and we are ever grateful to them. It is my understanding that community members have been respectfully complying with health department orders to stay in. Special arrangements are being made for virtual religious services so those can remain at home as mandated. I want to thank those who helped us get the best care possible by working their channels to get Lawrence moved to Columbia ICU where the medical care and personal sensitivity has been exemplary. Lastly, when I first heard that Lawrence was positive, I immediately recognized there was going to be pandemonium all around us. Other than offering what I could to stop this from spreading further, all I and my family care about is that my husband/ their father get better. We shuttered the windows, turned off the internet and together stayed strong and in good spirits. I am incredibly blessed that my children while still relatively young have the wisdom to know to keep their heads clear and focus only on the important, the health of their dad and those around us. Thank you all for your positive thoughts and prayers- I believe it is what will get us all through this trying time. I beg you all to stay calm and keep out of the hoopla. Be smart with good hygiene and know this too will pass. Good wishes and positive thoughts for us all! - Adina Lewis Garbuz",real
"China has unveiled its first 'intelligent' makeshift coronavirus hospital, which sees 5G-powered robots providing round-the-clock care for patients. Six different types of droids have taken up posts at the facility to reduce medics' heavy workload and prevent cross-infection between doctors and patients, according to Chinese media. The high-tech programme was launched last Saturday at the Wuchang field hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province of central China. The intelligent machines can take patients' temperature and deliver meals to them. They can also patrol and disinfect hospital areas. A video shows one robot named Ginger, leading a dance routine with a group of hazmat-clad medics while the quarantined patients watch their performance. The 5G-equipped network also allows the doctors to use the stats-collecting robots and receive live updates of the patients remotely. This came after the makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, built during the coronavirus outbreak, had required advanced technology to improve their efficiency, according to reports. The use of the self-driving and self-charging machines could cut down the workload of medics and reduce the risks of cross-infection, according to officials. Over 3,000 medical staff in Hubei Province have been infected with the deadly disease since the outbreak, according to Chinese officials. On February 28, Hubei officials teamed up with Chinese Academy of Sciences to deliver the project. Twelve sets of robotic devices were donated by CloudMinds, a Chinese tech start-up specialising in intelligent robots. The tech firm, along with the state-owned telecom company China Mobile,built the intelligent system for the hospital within a week. Another Chinese hospital has started to use two robots powered by artificial intelligence and capable of disinfecting themselves to help treat coronavirus patients. The pair ofdroids began to deliver medicine and food to sufferers as well as collecting bed sheets and medical rubbish in the province of Guangdong, said the local health commission. The killer coronavirus rapidly sweeping the world has now infected over 110,000 people worldwide, with a recent uptick in cases across Europe. China has confirmed at least 80,735 cases and 3,119 deaths since the virus was first discovered in Wuhan late last year. Germany is now testing patients for the deadly coronavirus in their comfort of their own car as the country's outbreak continues to spiral. In hope of keeping potentially infected patients away from hospitals, Germany has now rolled out drive-thru testing stations. The move follows the UK and South Korea, where demand for testing has grown in response to escalating epidemics. An outbreak started on British soil last week and a third person died on Sunday – at least 280 people have already been infected and there are no signs officials will be able to contain the virus from spreading more in the coming days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is today hosting a Cobra meeting of senior Government ministers to discuss how best to tackle the deadly outbreak. It comes after sources inside Number 10 last week said officials believe the virus 'ishighly likely that it is going to spread in a significant way'. The British Foreign Office has advised against 'all but essential travel' to a number of areas in northern Italy as total cases reach more than 7,000. It warned citizens to avoid traditional tourist hotspots such as Venice and Milan due to control and isolation measures imposed by Italian authorities and cases of coronavirus reported. Rome has already placed the Lombardy region, with a population of 16million, on lock-down. It comes as UK employers are also reported to be sending employees that have recently travelled to Italy home for a two-week isolation period. The Foreign Office warned against all travel to the Lombardy region alongside the provinces of Emilia Romagna and Piemonte. It also warned against visiting Pesaro e Urbino in Marche and Treviso and Venice in the Veneto region. It first warned against travel to eleven towns in northern Italy on February 25 after 322 coronavirus cases were reported.",real
"At least 26 US tourists are being held in quarantine for 14 days aboard a River Nile cruise ship in Egypt. Scores of foreign visitors and Egyptian crew remain quarantined on board the ship from which 45 suspected coronavirus cases have been evacuated. US, French and Indian nationals are among those stranded near the southern tourist city of Luxor. The Americans that are held are all part of the same tour group and were in the middle of a 12-day vacation in Egypt. They had already seen the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx and had boarded the luxury ship, the MS Asara, for a Nile cruise. When they arrived in Luxoron Fridaythey learned that 12 Egyptian workers on their boat had tested positive for the virus that causes covid-19 during a previous cruise.  At least three of the Americans are suspected of testing positive for the virus, according to passengers aboard the ship. 'I'm terribly afraid that there's no assurance we won't get sick at some point,' Amy Khamissian, 65, a paralegal from Miami told The Top 10 News. Egyptian authorities had Saturday reported moving 45 suspected cases - 33 passengers and 12 crew - into isolation on land, without specifying what happened to the others aboard. The ship was carrying 171 people - 101 foreigners and 70 Egyptian crew - Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli told reporters on Saturday. Egypt on Sunday reported the country's - and Africa's - first death from the virus, a 60-year-old German tourist who died in a Red Sea resort in eastern Egypt. Until late last week Egypt had reported just three cases of the novel coronavirus, at a time when France and other countries had reported suspected cases among travellers returning from the north African country. On Monday, Egypt's health ministry said the total number of known cases had risen to 55. Khamissian and another Miami resident, Javier Parodi, 35, a building inspector, were told they tested negative on Saturday night, hours after they had been instructed to stay in their cabins. Their guide had told them that one American in their group had tested positive. 'Everything was normal, and now things are taking a turn to the not so normal,' Parodi said. US embassy spokesman Sam Werberg in Cairo said 'we are in the process of making contact with all American passengers'. A German tourist who arrived in Egypt a week ago has become the first person to die of coronavirus in Africa. The patient, 60, showed symptoms of a fever after he travelled from Luxor in southern Egypt to the Hurghada resort town on the Red Sea coast on Friday. The man, who had travelled from his native Germany a week ago, reportedly refused to be transferred to the quarantine hospital in Matrouh to be admitted to intensive care, Egypt Today reported. He was said to have suffered from respiratory failure caused by severe pneumonia before he died on Sunday, Egyptian officials said. Despite the fatality, Africa has significantly fewer coronavirus cases than Europe, Asia and North America, with only around 91 confirmed across the continent so far. On Saturday they tweeted a statement on their official account that read: 'The Embassy has been informed that there are U.S. citizens on a Nile Cruise ship on which 12 crew members tested positive for the coronavirus. 'The Embassy is working to provide consular services and assistance, in coordination with the Egyptian government.' Maryland's governor said that three travelers from Montgomery Country tested positive for the virus after returning to the US from a trip on the same cruise. As many as 28 tourists, from the United States, Greece, France and Canada, have tested positive for the virus after visiting Egypt in recent weeks. Some of them were on Nile cruises, but it's unclear whether they were all related to the MS Asara. When the MS Asara arrived in Luxor on Friday, the group's travel company, Gate 1, sent the American passengers a letter saying the CDC personnel had informed them of 'possible exposure' to the coronavirus on the ship. The CDC asked for names and contacts of Gate 1 passengers aboard the ship, according to the letter obtained by The Washington Post. Matt Swider, a technology journalist from New York was taken from the ship to hospital. He said: 'I am feeling fine. Others around me seem mildly ill.' It comes as workers on Nile cruise ships are quitting their jobs after the confirmed infections.",real
"While Japanese officials delay the start of their professional baseball season amid fears of coronavirus, Major League Baseball has not given any indication that Opening Day will be postponed in the United States. Five league sources told The Athletic that the commissioner's office is not currently warning teams about a potential opening day postponement. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred will reportedly address coronavirus concerns with owners during a conference call on Monday. A league spokesman did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment. MLB previously sent a memo to teams last month sharing recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control aimed at stemming the virus outbreak. The league has formed a task force to monitor the situation and provided periodic updates to teams on measures to protect fans, players and team personnel - including the suggestion to have players pre-sign memorabilia. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Should the games go on as scheduled on March 26, this will mark the third consecutive year that every MLB team opens its season on the same day. However, each club's home stadium faces varying degrees of exposure to the coronavirus outbreak, and local governments' responses to the crisis can change drastically from market to market. In Washington, where the Seattle Mariners play, Governor Jay Inslee is considering 'mandatory measures,' he told Face The Nation on Sunday. 'We've asked a whole host of communities to consider whether you really need to have your events right now, and they are being canceled,' Insley said without specifically addressing the upcoming MLB season. 'Comic Con has been postponed. We have a number of school closures. We are contemplating some next steps, particularly to protect our vulnerable po- populations and our nursing homes and the like. And we are looking to determine whether mandatory measures are required.' Meanwhile a cruise ship infected with coronavirus is expected to dock in Oakland, home of the Athletics and near the San Francisco Giants' home stadium across the Bay. Washington and California both have over 100 reported cases of coronavirus,according toThe New York Times MLB has remained in constant contact with the Center for Disease Control and the US Department of Health and Human Services, just as other leagues have. The NBA circulated a memo to its teams Friday telling them to prepare in case it becomes necessary to play games without fans or media, as sports leagues in Europe have already done. The memo detailed potential actions that teams might need to take 'if it were to become necessary to play a game with only essential staff present.' Last week the NHL sent a memo to teams urging players to limit contact with fans because of the coronavirus outbreak. The move follows a similar directive this month by the NBA, which has told its players to stop high-fiving fans and strangers, and avoid taking items for autographs. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday at the close of the annual general managers meetings in Florida that he's ordered a halt to all business-related travel outside North America for league employees. Meanwhile an advocacy group for college athletes has urged the NCAA to consider holding all of its winter sports championships without fans. However, nobody has suggested forgoing broadcasts of March Madness games, which would presumably still be televised. 'If you can think of it, it's something that we've gone through an analysis around,' NCAA Chief Operating Officer Donald Remy told Bloomberg Newson Tuesday. 'We've contingency planned for all circumstances.' The NCAA generates nearly $1 billion a year, most of it coming from the men's basketball tournament through media rights fees, corporate sponsorships and ticket sales. The Indianapolis-based organization declined further  Japanese officials postponed the start of the 12-team professional baseball league season on Monday because of the spread of the coronavirus. The season was to open on March 20. Japan's professional league had been playing its preseason games without fans because of the virus. 'I personally believe that we have no choice but to postpone at this stage,' Japanese league commissioner Atsushi Saito said. Baseball officials said they were unsure when the season might start, but mentioned some time in April. Japan's baseball league last suspended play in 2011 after an earthquake, tsunami and the subsequent meltdown of three nuclear reactors in Fukushima prefecture, located 250 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Tokyo. The head of the soccer J-League said it was also extending its suspension of play. That league had suspended play until March 18. 'At this moment I think it's very difficult to resume the matches,' J-League chairman Mitsuru Murai said. An expert in infection control has been advising both leagues. 'We suggested at this point it would be better to postpone their matches,' said Mitsuo Kaku, a professor at Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University. Baseball and soccer are among many sports that have been shut down in Japan by the spreading virus, or taking place without fans.",real
"The iconic start to Tokyo's 2020 Olympic Games will be held without spectators as it was announced the traditional torch-lighting ceremony will take place with no fans in attendance. The Greek Olympic Committee announced on Monday that the torch-lighting ceremony – the symbolic start of each Olympic Games – will be staged at a scaled-down, behind-closed-doors event due to the ongoing fears over the spread of coronavirus in the region. The Committee announced the Olympic torch will be lit during a smaller-scale ceremony in ancient Olympia on Thursday, March 12 before heading off on a seven-day relay, ending in an official handover ceremony in Greece on March 19. However, the mayor of Olympia has requested to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the ceremony be pushed back to May. 'The danger of staging the torch lighting with only a handful of spectators, limited number of officials and delegations, and under a cloud of fear and concern will damage the greatness and prestige of this event,' said mayor Giorgos Georgiopoulos said in his letter to the IOC. 'With a sense of responsibility, the municipal authority, all parties of the city council of Ancient Olympia, in order to secure the global radiance of the event asks the IOC which has the exclusive responsibility of organizing it to consider the possibility of moving the torch lighting ceremony to May of this year.' A source told international news agency Reuters that the ancient stadium in Olympia – host to the original Olympic Games – will only have a small number of permitted attendees, with around 150 Tokyo Olympic officials allowed access inside the stadium for the ceremony. The source also stated that there will also be a tightening on media accreditations for the event, while the scheduled dress rehearsal for the ceremony will also go ahead without spectators or media. The Greek government announced a two-week ban on sporting events with spectators following a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases in the country. Olympia is based within the prefecture of Ilia, which is one of the hardest-hit regions by the coronavirus in Greece. 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES In doubt The scale of the outbreak in Japan sawsenior International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound describe the disease as 'the new war' threatening Tokyo 2020 and he warned the Games may have to be cancelled if the virus was still around by May. The Japanese government later insisted Pound's comments were not the IOC's official stance but there remains doubts over whether the summer showcase can still go ahead with health concerns. Athletes have been told to keep training and the plan remains to hold the Games in Japan as planned but training for around 80,000 volunteers has been delayed for at least two months- it was due to begin on February 22.

"The BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament has been cancelled amid a coronavirus outbreak in Califoria, marking the first major sporting event in the US to be axed due to the contagious disease. The professional tennis tournament, which draws athletes from around the world such as Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal and thousands of fans, was slated to take place from Monday March 9 to March 22 inIndian Wells, California. Officials made a decision late Sunday to cancel the tournament declaring a public health emergency. 'It is not in the public interest of fans, players and neighboring areas for this tournament to proceed. We all have to join together to protect the community from the coronavirus outbreak,' the tournament released in a statement. The move comes amid a whirlwind 24 hours during which Riverside County officials revealed Saturday night the area's first confirmed case of locally acquired coronavirus.Indian Wells is located within Riverside County. Earlier Sunday, the county declared a public health emergency, leading tournament officials to cancel the tournament. California has reported 114 cases of the virus, including a patient being treated at a hospital in Rancho Mirage in Riverside County. In the US there are over 500 cases and 22 deaths reported so far. 'The Riverside County Public Health Department has declared a public health emergency for the Coachella Valley after a confirmed case of coronavirus (COVID-19) locally,' a statement posted to the event's website late Sunday read. 'As a result, the 2020 BNP Paribas Open will not take place at this time due to concerns surrounding the coronavirus and the safety of the participants and attendees at the event. This is following the guidance of medical professionals, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and State of California.' ""There is too great a risk, at this time, to the public health of the Riverside County area in holding a large gathering of this size,' Dr. David Agus, professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California said in the statement. The tournament was set to take place in Indian Wells, just about five miles away from Indio, California where the annual Coachella Music Festival takes place. BNP fans who purchased tickets to the event can get a refund or receive a credit for the event in 2021. While organizers declared the event canceled and are offering 2021 credit, tournament director Tommy Haas' statement was a little more ambiguous when it comes to when the event may next be held. 'We are very disappointed that the tournament will not take place, but the health and safety of the local community, fans, players, volunteers, sponsors, employees, vendors, and everyone involved with the event is of paramount importance. We are prepared to hold the tournament on another date and will explore options,' Haas said in the statement. The tournament is one of the more popular stops on both the WTA and ATP tours, often called tennis' 'fifth slam.' According to even organizers, the 2019 installment of the tournament saw a record 475,372 fans attend the two-week event. Canadian Bianca Andreescu became the first wild card to win the event on the women's side last year, beating Angelique Kerber in the final, while Austria's Dominic Thiem upset Roger Federer to win the men's title in 2019. The purse for this year's event was more than $8.5 million for each tour. While organizers for Coachella have not cancelled the festival after the coronavirus case, other festivals across the nation have axed their programming. So far the Ultra Music Festival in Miami and the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas have been cancelled.",real
"A woman was mistakenly told her mother was doing well hours after she'd died at a Washington state nursing home where 19 people have died from coronavirus, and a county executive has said he's 'losing patience' as several other families of residents have complained the facility cannot cope. Pat Herrick said she tried to get in contact with her 81-year-old mother Wednesday night but a Life Care nurse said Elaine Herrick had just gone to bed. By 3.30am Thursday, Pat received a call that Elaine had passed away. 'I was so shocked because she's been in better health,'Pat told ABC News. Pat was even more shocked when a representative at Life Care in Tennessee called seven hours later to 'let you know that your mother's doing fine, that she doesn't have a temperature'. Pat replied: 'That's b******t. My mom died at 3.30am this morning.' Elaine had not been a confirmed coronavirus case but Pat wants her body tested for COVID-19. A total of 26 people have died at Life Care since the first coronavirus case was confirmed. Seven of those deaths were not people who were known to be infected. ABC News reported 60 residents are still at the assisted living facility where Pat claimed her mother was sharing a room with two people had been coughing for days. At least 44 people there have been infected. Sixteen out of 19 people killed by COVID-19 in the state were residents at Life Care, where the first case of the deadly virus was confirmed on February 19. While one patient complained about being on lockdown as staff tried to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the family of another said they were surprised they were allowed to visit the property in Kirkland. The family member of a third patient said he was worried he may soon have to arrange a funeral as Life Care struggles to get a grip. Kevin Connelly also complained that information was insufficient as he and other families of residents held a press conference Thursday. Kevin said he received conflicting information about whether his father-in-law Jerry Wall qualified to be tested. When he contacted the CDC hotline was told he'd have to wait 10 days for a reply. Life Care had three dedicated CDC officials on site to deal with the concerns but Connelly said the availability was 'intermittent', and called it 'wholly inadequate and laughable'. It was unclear whether patients were in isolation. Susan Hailey, 76, said she left the facility to get tested at a hospital but was sent back to Life Care while awaiting her results. 'We're told they're quarantined, and then we're told it's not actually quarantine. They're just confined to their beds,' Connolly continued. 'Then we were told that actually they're free to get up and move.' Connelly said he was considering removing Wall from the home: 'My fear is that in a week, we will be arranging a funeral.' Colleen Mallory shared that she recently was allowed to visit the facility despite previously being told they were accepting no more visitors. But she described it as 'eerie' and someone who shared a room with her 89-year-old mother was suddenly gone one day. The lack of staff was noted, too. A total of 70 employees displaying symptoms had been ordered to stay home. King County Executive Dow Constantine praised remaining staff for showing up to help. 'I've been extremely frustrated about this,' he admitted in a news conference Friday. 'We've had some challenges with Life Care, and I've started to lose my patience.' He said 30 U.S. Public Health Service medical professionals were arriving at the center over the weekend. Constantine previously announced it had purchased an 85-bed motel south of Seattle to house patients for recovery and isolation. He added: 'We are grateful the cavalry is arriving. It going to make really rapid change in the conditions there. The state is working with families to tailor solutions that will work for each of them.' Speaking about the difficulty families have had regarding not knowing whether their loved ones should be moved, Constantine added: 'We are not going to allow that to occur in the future as we put those federal resources in place… 'For the families who say they're not being adequately communicated with, we hear you.' As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, health experts advise plane travelers to sit in a window seat, disinfect their table trays and window blinds, and warn that wearing a mask won't prevent infection. Officials say the best way to avoid catching the virus, which is spread through viral particles within mucus or saliva, is to keep your hands clean, disinfect your space, and avoid touching your face. It is also advised that plane travelers choose a window seat to have less contact with potentially sick people. 'Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,' Vicki Stover Hertzberg, professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, said. Hertzberg helped conduct a study that followed passengers and crew members on 10 three to five-hour flights during the flu season and found that passengers who sit in the window seats had less contact with ill people. Wearing a mask on the plane may not prove helpful as the air in the aircraft is considered sterile because there are so few microorganisms at such a high altitude and the plane draws fresh air from the outside. About 50 percent of the air in cabins is recirculated but it goes through sophisticated air filters similar to those used in surgical environments, before it's its pushed back into the plane. A problem with paper masks is that they don't have a respirator to filter out infectious air articles. That means passengers are more likely to catch the virus through direct contact from someone with the virus or surfaces rather than through the air. But one study found that the other coronaviruses - such as SARS and MERS - remains on metal, glass, and plastic surfaces for up to nine days. Top tips include: - Good hand hygiene: Frequently wash hands for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitzer - Disinfect your space: Bring your own wipes and wipe down window blinds, seat belts, arm rests, touch screens and tray tables - Choose a window seat: Sit near the window and avoid moving around the cabin to limit exposure to potentially sick people - Use touch screen with a tissue: Avoid contact with surfaces that may hold the virus - Avoid touching your face: 2019-nCov is spread through viral particles in mucus or saliva. Avoid touching your face and transferring germs picked up from surfaces",real
"While the coronavirus is hurting many companies in china, on in particular is thriving because of the disease. Neolix, a driverless delivery service, has experienced a spike in demand as it helps reduce physical contact and fills in at a time of labor shortages – many workers in the country have been quarantined. The autonomous vans are being used to deliver medical supplies, disinfect streets and delivery food to people who are in the heart of the outbreak. The startup has booked orders for more than 200 vehicles in the past two months and before that, it had only produced 125 units since last May, founder Yu Enyuan said in an interview with Bloomberg. The tiny vans, which are essentially four-wheeled robots outfitted with trunks for storage, are capable of navigating their environment without any human pilot. Scroll down for video China has placed restrictions on the use of such vehicles prior coronavirus, but has eased them due to the fact streets are now empty and safety risks are low. Yu also noted that 'people's perception toward driverless delivery had a complete 180-degree shift.' 'People realize that such vehicles can get things done when it is risky for a human being to do so.' Billionaire Jack Ma made a prediction three years ago that there would be one billion deliveries a day made in China within the next 10 years via driverless services. However, the country has been strict on the companies they let test their technology on public streets due to intense traffic constantly flooding the area. But since the outbreak, the streets have become empty allowing autonomous vehicles, like Neolix, take to the streets. 'China's digital services economy has prospered during the crisis as people shifted to online consumption,' said Bill Russo, CEO of consulting firm Automobility Ltd. 'This will accelerate the commercialization of autonomous service delivery solutions. Neolix and others stand to benefit.' Restrictions have changed so much over the past few months that China is also offering to fund purchase and operation of driverless delivery vans in their jurisdictions for up to 60% of the tag price, according to Yu. The government subsidies will speed up promotion of the vehicles, according to the company, which expects to sell 1,000 units this year. 'The industry has entered into a fast expansion phase because of the virus,' Yu said. Last year,a seperate report from Bloombergrevealed Neolix had begun production on 1,000 level four autonomous vehicles that it plans to roll out in China throughout the next year. Neolix's robotic courier will cost around $30,000 each and could usher in a new era for e-commerce in China where companies like Alibaba have exploded in scope. In 2019 alone, Alibaba has generated about $152 billion. Delivery firms are pioneering a host of new technologies to tackle the last mile of deliveries. It is hoped the vehicles can cut the inefficiencies, and hence costs, of the final stage of delivery, in which packages are taken from a central hub to your door. Amazon envisions making last mile deliveries with an army of autonomous drones that drop packages on your doorstep. Amazon has billed the service 'Prime Air' and claims the drones will increase the overall safety and efficiency of its transport system. Just one pilot could oversee several of the drones at once, meaning the firm could someday pay fewer people to make the same number of deliveries. Another company, Starship Technologies, envisions its autonomous delivery service using land-based robots. Each six-wheeled 'ground drone' is almost completely self-driving, and is constantly connected to the internet, using GPS to find its destination. Walking on the pavement at about 4mph (3km/h), robots can complete local deliveries within five to 30 minutes from a local hub or retail outlet. Self-driving cars are another last mile option being considered by some delivery companies. Supermarket operator Kroger is testing a fleet of self-driving grocery cars that can carry as many as ten bags of shopping to your door. Customers can order groceries via Kroger's website or mobile app and select same-day or next-day delivery. Customers who take advantage of Kroger's driverless grocery delivery system will still have to walk to the curb outside their house to retrieve the groceries.",real
"Columbia University has canceled two days of classes and students will be taught remotely for a week after a person at the school was exposed to coronavirus. The 'school community member', who is now under quarantine, has not been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus, university president Lee Bollinger confirmed in a statement. Classes at theIvy League school, in New York, will be suspended on Monday and Tuesday as the university 'prepares to shift to remote classes for the remainder of the week'. Mr Bollinger added that all 'non-classroom activities' such as research will 'continue in accordance with the new travel and event restrictions announced recently'. Officials did not say if the person was a student or staff member. 'At this point, just to restate what is important to know, we do not have a confirmed case of the virus on campus,' he said.'This action is intended to prevent the virus from spreading.' The statement added: 'I am writing this evening to notify everyone that, because a member of our community has been quarantined as a result of exposure to the Coronavirus (COVID-19), we have decided to suspend classes on Monday and Tuesday. 'This suspension of activities will allow us to prepare to shift to remote classes for the remainder of the week. I want to emphasize that the individual who has been quarantined has not been diagnosed at this point with the virus.' The school had already planned to be closed next week for spring break, which means students will be away from campus for the virus' 14-day quarantine period. It comes asNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday, following the action of California, Washington, and Florida. The number of coronavirus cases in New York state grew to 76 this weekend, up from 44 the previous day.At least ten of these patients have been hospitalized, Cuomo added.

"Instagram users have been criticised for creating a variety of controversial coronavirus-themed filters in the wake of the global health crisis. The AR effects, which can be applied on Instagram Stories, range from simple face masks to glowing green coronavirus molecules that float around the subject’s face. Others include a box that ‘determines if you’ll contract or die from the coronavirus’, with flashing text that toggles between ‘no I’m safe (for now)’ and ‘yes, goodbye’. One filter, created, by smirnov.mikita, places the word ‘Coronavirus’ in neon light on the user’s face, while another by gioacchinonmar covers them with black face sores. Any Instagram user can apply the filters to their Story by searching ‘coronavirus’ on Instagram Effects Gallery. However, the filters are proving controversial, with many social media users slamming them for being ‘inappropriate’. ‘We’re talking about something that is currently killing people!! Completely inappropriate,’ said @KarenMAmouyal. ‘Someone made a coronavirus filter for Instagram y'all are so stupid,’ tweeted @harianashe. However, some developers of the filters claims to be using coronavirus-themed filters to illustrate how people can prevent the virus from spreading. ‘I’m using the technology of Augmented Reality to create a #Instagram filter that would make people aware of the origins of #coronavirus and how to prevent how it spreads out!’ said @geekydiego. Another filter of a big red AR coronavirus molecule has been used to show how the virus can survive on surfaces. An Instagram Story from US news site azcentral shows the animated virus overlaid on surfaces in the home with the text: ‘The virus can live on surfaces for up to six days. ‘One easy way to prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak? Wash your hands.’ To access all the various filters, Instagrammers need to select ‘Your Story’ in the top left of the app’s homepage. From there, they can tap on any one of the filter names to bring up a menu with the option ‘Browse effects’. After selecting this option, users can select the magnifying glass icon and simply search ‘coronavirus’ to bring up the range of potentially offensive filters. Anyone can create their own Instagram filter using the Spark AR Studio platform. Facebook, which owns Instagram, is yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment regarding the filters. The social media giant has been working to restrict the flow of misinformation related to the coronavirus outbreak on its website. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced it isproviding the World Health Organisation (WHO) with 'as many free ads as it needs' for its coronavirus response. It is also removing false claims and conspiracy theories to ensure users are not misinformed about the virus and its risks. This includesads that try to 'exploit the situation', such as those for ineffective face masks that advertise a 'limited supply' to boost sales. WHO says that face masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. The coronavirus, officially called COVID-19, has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide as of Monday morning, with nearly 3,500 deaths. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. Nearly 4,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 110,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 – possibly 9,700 – were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 – doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests – caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. There is now evidence that it can spread third hand – to someone from a person who caught it from another person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak is an epidemic, which is when a disease takes hold of one community such as a country or region. Although it has spread to dozens of countries, the outbreak is not yet classed as a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. The head of WHO's global infectious hazard preparedness, Dr Sylvie Briand, said: 'Currently we are not in a pandemic. We are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci, and we try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci,' the Guardian reported. She said that most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world. ",real
"Panic surrounding the spread of coronavirus is turning us into a 'selfish society', a psychologist has explained. Dr Martina Paglia, director of theInternational Psychology Clinic, in London, told how a sense of 'emergency' and concern over personal safety triggers the part of the brain associated with 'fight or flight' and allows 'basic, animal instinct' to takeover. She noted the issues that have already been caused by stockpiling and reports of price hikes, and warned the situation could worsen if people did not change their behaviour. It comes as a third patient in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus died and the number of cases in Britain shot up to 278 in just 24 hours. The number of global cases reached 107,800, with 3,661 deaths across 95 countries. Dr Paglia explained: 'During times of uncertainty, the part of the brain that copes with anxiety disrupts another area of the brain that controls behaviour. 'This usually results in causing fear and group-thinking behaviour, and triggers our fight or flight response, which is our basic, animal instinct'. The brain is hardwired to react in this defensive manner in order to preserve the individual's life. This is essential at times when a person is in immediate danger, however it is currently leading tonegative and damaging social behaviour such as xenophobia, stress, hoarding and panic buying, which has the potential of having a huge impact on society, Dr Paglia said. She urged people to have greater awareness of their own behaviour in order to keep it under control. 'We can reduce the urge for fight or flight by being knowledgeable and mindful of the anxious response we may be experiencing', she continued. 'Try to avoid panicking by understanding and accepting the anxiety, making sure that the information you're receiving is actual fact rather than just opinion, and take control of your response. In this way, you'll feel less anxious and inclined to panic buy. Instead, you'll find you can make better, calmer, more rational decisions and will even possibly discover that you're more resourceful than you ever thought.' A third patient in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus has died, it emerged last night.The male patient, aged over 60, had 'significant underlying health conditions' and had recently returned from trip to Italy. He was being treated at North Manchester General Hospital's specialist regional unit for infectious diseases. It came as Northern Ireland reported five new cases of coronavirus, adding to the biggest daily rise in the number of cases reported in the UK. The Department of Health said on Sunday afternoon that as of 9am on Sunday there were 273 coronavirus cases and 64 new patients. Health chiefs faced serious questions last night as it emerged travellers from Italy, at the centre of Europe's outbreak with more than 7,000 cases, said they had been able to get off flights to the UK without seeing any officials. Flights from countries including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia are subject to so-called enhanced monitoring measures. This means that when a passenger feels unwell they should alert the air crew. The pilot will then have to ask the destination airport for permission before anyone can disembark. Leaflets are then handed out to all passengers about calling NHS 111 and self-isolating if they experience a cough, sore throat or temperature.",real
"A US citizen in Saudi Arabia has tested positive for coronavirus after he traveled from the Philippines and Italy, the Health Ministry confirmed. The man, whose name and home state were not revealed, is now receiving treatment at a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi officials added. Three others in theAl Qatif province, including two Bahrani citizens, have also recently tested positive for the virus, CNN reported. It comes as all travel in and out of the province was suspended on Sunday to prevent the spread of COVID-19 after four more cases were reported in the area. The total number of coronavirus cases in the eastern province has now reached 11, most of Saudi Arabia's 15positive coronavirus cases. On Monday, concerns over the virus ledSaudi Arabia to cut off air and sea travel with Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Kuwait, Lebanon, South Korea, Syria and the United Arab Emirates.The kingdom had already shut its land borders. 'Out of concern to protect the health of citizens and residents and ensure their safety, the kingdom's government decided to temporarily suspend the travel,' an Interior Ministry official said. Saudi Arabia has also shut down access to some of the holiest sites in Islam over concerns about COVID-19. The citizen's diagnosis comes as the coronavirus death toll grew to 22 in the US today. Health officials confirmed a patient inGrant County, Washington, died as a result of the virus, but no other details of the case were revealed. In a statement,Grant County Health District Administrator Theresa Adkinson offered her condolences to the patient's family and friends. Some 19 of the 22 deaths due to coronavirus in the US have taken place in Washington state, with the three others in California and Florida. The United States currently has 554 confirmed cases of the virus.",real
"Amazon is cracking down price gougers on its platform who are looking to make a profit from the coronavirus that is wreaking havoc across the globe. The tech giant has pulled more than 530,000 listings from the site and suspended over 2,500 US sellers. The firm announced on Friday it is working with state attorneys general to identify and prosecute third-party sellers who are taking advantage of fears of the spreading coronavirus to engage in price-gouging on the Amazon website. Amazon also said it has begun manual audits of products in its online stores to spot sellers that evade its automated systems, which check for items that are 'unfairly priced.' Scroll down for video In a letter to U.S. Senator Edward Markey, the company said it has removed more than 530,000 product offers over price-gouging concerns as well as 'millions' of products that make unsupported claims about their ability to fight coronavirus. 'Our selling partners submit billions of price changes every week,' the letter reads, 'and our automated tools scan them on an ongoing basis.' 'We continuously compare the prices submitted by our selling partners with current and historic prices within and outside of the Amazon store.' 'We apply price thresholds and machine learning models to determine whether those prices are fair for our customers.' Markey wrote Amazon earlier this week asking the company to stop third-party sellers from ramping up prices for items like Purell hand sanitizers as people seek to protect themselves from the coronavirus. Markey said he wrote the letter after finding that a pack of 24 2-ounce bottles of Purell, which should cost $10, was selling for $400 on the company's website. U.S. retailers have been witnessing a surge in 'panic-buying' from shoppers racing to stock up on essential items. The number of people infected with coronavirus surpassed 100,000 across the world on Friday, as the outbreak reached more countries and economic damage intensified, with business districts beginning to empty and stock markets tumbling. The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with seven countries reporting their first cases on Friday. 'We have suspended thousands of accounts of sellers who have engaged in price gouging and we have begun working with several state attorneys general to prosecute the worst offenders,' Amazon said in the letter. A bill signed by U.S. President Donald Trump will provide $8.3 billion to bolster the United States capacity to test for coronavirus and fund other measures to stem the outbreak that has spread to 22 states, with Pennsylvania, Indiana and Minnesota reporting their first cases. Last month, Amazon had revealed it barred more than one million products from being sold on the platform that claimed to cure or defend against the coronavirus. A merchant was offering a 10-pack of N95 masks for $128, a Reuters reporter saw when clicking through the buying options on Amazon. That was up from a recent seller average price of $41.24, according to the price-tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. The item was no longer available later in the day. A two-pack respirator was offered new at $24.99 earlier this week by a third-party seller, up from a recent average of $6.65 when sold by Amazon, the price-following site showed. As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, health experts advise plane travelers to sit in a window seat, disinfect their table trays and window blinds, and warn that wearing a mask won't prevent infection. Officials say the best way to avoid catching the virus, which is spread through viral particles within mucus or saliva, is to keep your hands clean, disinfect your space, and avoid touching your face. It is also advised that plane travelers choose a window seat to have less contact with potentially sick people. 'Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,' Vicki Stover Hertzberg, professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, said. Hertzberg helped conduct a study that followed passengers and crew members on 10 three to five-hour flights during the flu season and found that passengers who sit in the window seats had less contact with ill people. Wearing a mask on the plane may not prove helpful as the air in the aircraft is considered sterile because there are so few microorganisms at such a high altitude and the plane draws fresh air from the outside. About 50 percent of the air in cabins is recirculated but it goes through sophisticated air filters similar to those used in surgical environments, before it's its pushed back into the plane. A problem with paper masks is that they don't have a respirator to filter out infectious air articles. That means passengers are more likely to catch the virus through direct contact from someone with the virus or surfaces rather than through the air. But one study found that the other coronaviruses - such as SARS and MERS - remains on metal, glass, and plastic surfaces for up to nine days. Top tips include: - Good hand hygiene: Frequently wash hands for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitzer - Disinfect your space: Bring your own wipes and wipe down window blinds, seat belts, arm rests, touch screens and tray tables - Choose a window seat: Sit near the window and avoid moving around the cabin to limit exposure to potentially sick people - Use touch screen with a tissue: Avoid contact with surfaces that may hold the virus - Avoid touching your face: 2019-nCov is spread through viral particles in mucus or saliva. Avoid touching your face and transferring germs picked up from surfaces ",real
"At least 11 people have died and 21 remain trapped after a hotel used for quarantining people under observation for the coronavirus collapsed in China, state media reported. Footage has captured the moment a woman was rescued from the rubble after being stranded under the debris for 21 hours. As of 2pm local time on Monday, rescuers had pulled 50 people from the rubble and 39 of them survived, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Rescue works are ongoing. The hotel's 65-year-old owner is under police investigation. The collapsed hotel, called Xinjia, is situated in downtown Quanzhou, a city of around 8.5 million people in south-eastern China's Fujian Province. It opened in June, 2018, and is reported to have around 80 rooms. The hotel had been converted into a temporary 'medical observation centre' for suspected coronavirus patients before it toppled at around 7:15pm on March 7. The building's first floor had been under renovation, Xinhua said in a previous report. A CCTV clip filmed from a nearby petrol station shows the hotel falling apart in a matter of seconds. Another video report from BJ News shows a 12-year-old boy being carried out of the debris Sunday morning after being buried for around 16 hours. The boy is filmed shouting at the rescuers 'my mum is right next to me' as he was being taken to an ambulance with a mask bound to his face to cover his eyes, nose and mouth. His mother was rescued at around 4:30pm yesterday, reported People's Daily. Pictures taken on Sunday at the rescue site showed rescue workers clad in hard hats, goggles and face masks carrying injured people away to medical staff in white overalls and surgical masks. A rescue force of over 1,000 people - including firefighters, police forces and other emergency responders - arrived at the site on Saturday night, according to government officials. Fujian Firefighting Department said they rescued at least three children, including one toddler, at around midnight Sunday. News of the collapse comes as the spread of the coronavirus continues to slow in China. China's National Health Commission (NHC) reported 40 new cases and 22 new deaths from yesterday, compared to 44 cases and 27 deaths from the day before. Of the 40 new confirmed cases, 36 were discovered in Wuhan, the origin of the virus' outbreak and its hotbed. None was discovered in other parts of Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital. The remaining four were cases imported from outside mainland China into the country's Gansu Province. Chinese cities are gradually relaxing quarantine measures after a month of strict implementation while authorities keep a close watch on the virus' spread overseas. As the virus slows its spread in Wuhan, the centre of the epidemic, authorities have reacted by halting operations of hospitals built specifically to house its patients. State television reported on Sunday that operations of 11 makeshift hospitals had been suspended and the remaining ones would be out of service by around March 10, although they could be used again depending on the virus situation. Outside of China, more than 100 nations are now battling the contagion, with South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran among the worst-affected. The global death toll has surpassed 3,869 and the total number of cases has reached over 110,800.",real
"A furious commuter has told off a woman for coughing on him on a packed Sydney train as tensions rise over the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The woman was filmed appearing to intentionally cough in the man's direction just moments after he quietly asked her to cover her mouth. The video was captured by ABC journalist Andy Park on Monday morning in a quiet carriage on Sydney's intercity V-set train. The footage begins with the man accusing the woman sitting opposite him of coughing without covering her mouth. 'I did not open my mouth when I coughed, I coughed inside my mouth,' the woman insists. 'It's disgusting,' the man responds bluntly, before putting his headphones on. The woman then rebuts by leaning in and faking a cough with an open mouth in his direction. 'Are you serious? Did you just cough at me?' the man asks, ripping off his headphones. The woman admits to coughing at him, before saying: 'I don't have the pandemic... bully.' The man becomes angry and takes off his sunglasses before exclaiming 'bully?' while taking a photo of the woman. 'I asked you politely to please cover your mouth.' 'The advice of the government is to cover your mouth when you cough and you coughed at me – with an open mouth.' 'Oh just shut up – I don't want to hear this. You're in a quiet carriage, just shut up,' the woman shoots back before the video cuts off. Australians are becoming increasingly worried amid the coronavirus outbreak, especially as supermarkets have been stripped bare of essential supplies. There have been at least 87 confirmed cases of the disease in Australia, including three people who have died, while more than 109,000 people have been infected globally. Products such as toilet paper and hand sanitiser have been sold out as people prepare for a potential coroanvirus pandemic. Authorities believe the situation will get worse before it gets better, and the disease has the potential to infect tens of thousands more people on home soil. Australia closed its borders to China in the wake of the crisis, and have since also restricted travel between Iran and Korea. The decision was made in response to the spike in cases in the regions and the threat posed to Australia. Globally, at least 3,802 people have died of coronavirus - primarily in mainland China, where the outbreak originated. NEW SOUTH WALES: 47 January 25 Three men aged 43, 53, and 35 who had recently travelled to China contracted the disease. Two flew in from Wuhan while the other arrived in Sydney from Shenzhen, south China. They were treated in isolation at Westmead Hospital.

"Stars of the silver screen have today paid tribute to the actor Max Von Sydow, who has died at the age of 90. The Hollywood legend, known for roles in Star Wars, Game Of Thrones, Flash Gordon and The Exorcist, died at his home in France on Sunday. His family announced the Swedish-born actor's death 'with a broken heart and infinite sadness' today. Actress Mia Farrow, who appeared alongside Von Sydow in the 1979 movie Hurricane, was among those paying tribute, remembering him as a 'great artist and true gentleman.' British director Edgar Wright called Von Sydow 'A God', tweeting: 'Max Von Sydow, such an iconic presence in cinema for seven decades, it seemed like he'd always be with us. 'He changed the face of international film with Bergman, played Christ, fought the devil, pressed the HOT HAIL button & was Oscar nominated for a silent performance.' The actor's agent Jean Diamond said: 'It is with a broken heart and with infinite sadness that we have the extreme pain of announcing the departure of Max Von Sydow, March 8, 2020.' Born in 1929, Von Sydow made his film debut in 1949, going on to appear in several films by Ingmar Bergman including a role as a knight in The Seventh Seal. The film's scenes of him playing chess with the figure of Death would become renowned in cinematic circles. Before his big-screen career took off, Von Sydow studied at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. He went on to work with Bergman at the Malmo Municipal Theatre in the 1950s. He also went on to star in other Bergman films including Wild Strawberries, The Virgin Spring and Hour Of The Wolf. Subsequently, he enjoyed an illustrious Hollywood career with movies including The Exorcist and Minority Report. He played Jesus in The Greatest Story Ever Told and Lassefar Karlsson in Pelle the Conqueror, which earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor. He received a second Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor, in 2011 for his role in the post-9/11 film Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close. He also played sinister James Bond super-villain Ernst Blofeld in 1983's Never Say Never Again. During his extensive film career he worked with a number of heavyweight directors, such as Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Woody Allen and Steven Spielberg. In 2015, von Sydow joined the cast of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, portraying Lor San Tekka who appeared at the very start of the film. The following year, he portrayed the mysterious Three-Eyed Raven in HBO'sGame Of Thrones, receiving a Primetime Emmy nomination. Although originally from Sweden, Von Sydow lived in France for many years and eventually took French citizenship. While his characters were often sinister, tormented or evil, the soft-spoken Von Sydow said he became an actor to overcome his own shyness. 'I was a very shy boy when I was a kid,' he once said in an Associated Press interview. 'When I started acting in an amateur group in high school, although I wasn't aware of it at the time, I suddenly got a tool in my hand that was wonderful. 'I was allowed to express all kinds of strange things that I never dared to express before. Now I could do it with the character as a shield, as a defense, and as an excuse. 'I think that for many years I used my profession as some kind of a mental therapy.' Von Sydow married Swedish actress Christina Olin in 1951 and had two sons, Clas and Henrik. The couple later divorced and he married French filmmaker Catherine Brelet in 1997, with whom he had two more sons, Yvan and Cedric. From Swedish arthouse to Hollywood: Max Von Sydow's 65 year career included starring roles in Ingar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and William Friedkin's The Exorcist Max von Sydow was known for his many collaborations with Ingmar Bergman before he made the leap to Hollywood . The actor, who has died aged 90, worked with the Swedish film-maker multiple times. Their credits included The Seventh Seal, in which he famously played chess with the figure of Death, The Magician, The Virgin Spring, Through A Glass Darkly, Hour Of The Wolf and Shame. In the 1960s, he made the move from European to US films. More recently, he appeared in Game Of Thrones and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Von Sydow was born in Lund, Sweden, but later became a French citizen. He was born Carl Adolf von Sydow, according to reports, but changed his name after deciding to act for a living. ""During my military service, I performed a sketch in which I played a flea called Max. So when critics kept misspelling my name, I decided to change it and thought, 'Ah! Max!',"" he later told The Guardian. He attended the acting academy at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. ""I didn't dream of becoming a movie actor when I was a boy, I wanted to go to the theatre,"" he later told The Wall Street Journal. ""I was very impressed by the first theatre I was introduced to ... and it made an enormous impression on me."" The actor made his film debut in the Swedish film Only A Mother in 1949. He was Oscar nominated twice - for best actor for his role in Pelle The Conqueror (1987) and for supporting actor for Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close (2011). He was also acclaimed for his role in The Diving Bell And The Butterfly (2007) and played sinister James Bond super-villain Ernst Blofeld in 1983 movie Never Say Never Again. Hollywood credits included The Exorcist, Minority Report, Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island and Ridley Scott's Robin Hood. Other titles included Hawaii, The Kremlin Letter, Three Days Of The Condor and Woody Allen's Hannah And Her Sisters, He appeared in Star Wars: The Force Awakens as Lor San Tekka and Game Of Thrones as the Three-eyed Raven, for which he was nominated for an Emmy. Von Sydow was previously married to actress Christina Inga Britta Olin and tied the knot with second wife Catherine Brelet in 1997.",real
"Bella Giannulli posted a tribute to mother Lori Loughlin on International Women's Day amid her parents' pending trial for the college admissions scandal. The 21-year-old daughter ofMossimo Giannulli took to her Instagram Story to post a throwback image of her now 55-year-old mother. No doubt there is a special place in Bella's heart for her mother as she captioned it: 'to my woman today and everyday [heart emoji]' Lori donned a green polka dot top and jeans as she sat on a wooden chair backwards in the snap seemingly taken in the Nineties. Both Bella and younger sister Olivia Jade, 20, are back to their regular routines nearly a year after authorities announced her parents were charged in the college admissions case, according to aPeople report from last week. 'Olivia and Bella both have active lives,' a source said. 'They hang out with friends, go shopping and go out for lunch and dinner. It's pretty typical lives for girls in their circle.' The source noted that 'right after the college scandal broke' in March of 2019, 'both girls were very low-key and avoided being photographed. 'But since Olivia is again active on social media, their lives have basically gone back to normal.' The source noted that the sisters 'don't avoid the paparazzi any more' and 'don't seem to mind being photographed.' Olivia Jade has definitely been living it up as of late as the YouTuber was pictured leaving the SHOREbar in Santa Monica on Thursday where stars such as Drake and Kendall and Kylie Jenner were partying at a Western theme birthday bash for Kylie's former assistant Victoria Villarroel. Loughlin, 55, and Mossimo, 56, have pleaded not guilty to federal charges of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit federal program bribery after they were accused of paying admissions official Rick Singer $500,000 to designate their daughters as recruits to the USC crew team, despite that neither of their girls ever rowed. The couple claims to have proof that the mastermind behind the sprawling scheme, Rick Singer, was told by FBI agents to lie about whether parents knew they were paying bribes, rather than legitimate donations. In a February 26 motion to postpone Loughlin and Giannulli's upcoming trial date, attorney Sean Berkowitz wrote that prosecutors had handed over notes from Singer's iPhone describing the alleged FBI coercion. 'Singer's notes indicate that FBI agents yelled at him and instructed him to lie by saying that he told his clients who participated in the alleged ""side door"" scheme that their payments were bribes, rather than legitimate donations that went to the schools,' Berkowitz wrote. Although the judge denied the request to postpone and set a court date for October 5, Loughlin and Giannulli remain confident that the evidence will help get them off. ",real
"Tom Brady paid tribute to the women in his life on International Women's Day. The football star posted an image of his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen with their daughter Vivian, aged seven, on Instagram. And there was a group photo as well which showed his motherGalynn Patricia Brady when she was battling breast cancer. She has since gone into remission. 'These women make my world go round! Happy international women’s day!' said the athlete in his caption to his 7.2M followers. Tom and Gisele wed in 2009 and have two children together: Vivian Lake and Benjamin, 10. He has son John Edward Thomas, 12, from his relationship with Bridget Moynahan. Brady, 42, will soon be a free agent as his contract with the New England Patriots expires on March 16. Football is his passion, but he has said his family is a top priority. In October he shared an image with his mother, who has beaten breast cancer in recent years, looking healthy. 'I couldn’t imagine a Mom and a Daughter that I could possibly love and adore more then these two,' Brady wrote. 'Today we were able to spend the afternoon talking and reading and catching up on our busy lives. But family is always number 1, and these two fill my heart every day! Grandma and Vivi.' Galynn fought breast cancer during the 2016 season. After Super Bowl LII, which saw Brady lead the Patriots to a 25-point comeback against the Atlanta Falcons, Galynn said her cancer went into remission. He also said during Jimmy Fund Radio Telethon in August: 'She gets her scans I think every three months, and she’s really done well. It’s been a while since she finished her treatments. We’re always kind of praying and hoping they come back clean. So far they have, and we’re very blessed. 'It’s touched our lives, and it’s touched my mom’s life, and it gives you perspective on life when you go through those things. I think we’re very thankful for all the people who supported her and for all the people that are doing great work in the world.' Bundchen posted an ethereal image of her daughter Vivian to her Instagram page. 'Today and everyday, I celebrate women,' wrote the 49-year-old former Victoria's Secret Angel. 'Through their strength, courage, and love they continue to transforming the world and making it a better place for the next generations to come.' Pink also shared a photo on Sunday. The 40-year-oldpop-punk songstress posted a precious portrait of herself, her son Jameson, three, and daughter Willow, eight, lying on the floor of her dressing room. '#internationalwomensday strong women; may we know them, may we raise them, may we be them,' captioned the singer. In the photo, shared with her7.2 million Instagram followers, Pink can be seen looking on at daughter Willow with pride, while the darling eight-year-old flashed a toothy grin. Sat right in the middle of the mother-daughter duo was three-year-old Jameson who wielded a delicious looking sandwich in his left hand. International Women's Day, held annually on March 8, serves to 'celebrate women’s achievements throughout history and across nations.' Pink shares Jameson and Willow with her husband of 14-years,former professional freestyle motocross competitor Carey Hart. The Just Give Me A Reason singer met her 44-year-old husband in 2001 during his stint at the Summer X Games. They would quickly become an item and were engaged by 2005. Pink and Hart endured a rough patch post-marriage, which resulted in a two-year separationin 2008. After years of marriage counseling, the pair decided to reconcile in 2011 and would go on to welcome their first child together, daughter Willow, the same year. The proud parents added a second offspring to the mix in 2016 with the birth of son Jameson. Kris Jenner had more than just one daughter to commemorate on the annual female-themed holiday, so the 64-year-old had to conjure up the perfect tribute. On her Instagram she wrote: 'I am beyond blessed to be surrounded by so many incredible women. My girls are my everything.' She shared a glamorous photograph of herself and her daughters, Khloe, Kim, Kourtney, Kylie, and Kendall, posing on and around a vintage automobile.",real
"For anyone struggling with excess weight and type 2 diabetes, this low-carb plan — part of the Mail’s Good Health for Life series — could be life-transforming. Here, Dr David Unwin — the NHS GP behind it — explains how the plan works, while chef and food writer Katie Caldesi gives low-carb recipes, written exclusively for you, that take less than 30 minutes to prepare. When I started as a GP in 1986, my practice had just 57 people with type 2 diabetes; 34 years later, with roughly the same number of people at the surgery, there are now 472 — that’s an eight-fold increase. Alongside this, I have seen an epidemic of obesity. Of course, my practice in Southport, Merseyside, is hardly unique, with the global explosion in obesity and type 2 puzzling health experts worldwide. In the UK, nearly one in three people today is overweight or obese. So what is going on? This cannot be genetic — people’s genes cannot change in just 35 years. It’s something about our environment that has changed. It’s our diet. We’re told the fundamental cause of obesity is an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. However, while the health benefits of exercise are generally agreed on, doctors increasingly suspect that losing weight is not one of them. A major review published by The American Dietetic Association in 2007 concluded that exercise alone leads to minimal weight loss. Why is this? The first problem is the length of time it takes to ‘exercise off’ the food you probably should not have eaten. For example, burning off a 300-calorie hamburger would take about 75 minutes of walking. It’s also possible that exercise makes some people hungrier, so calorie burning could be cancelled out, or worse, by what they then eat. So if exercise is not the answer, is it calorie restriction? When it comes to type 2 diabetes there is no doubt that a very low-calorie diet can help, as the groundbreaking work of Professor Roy Taylor at Newcastle University has shown. In this case, rapid weight-loss and the reversal of type 2 diabetes is brought about by drinking specially devised shakes for eight weeks. A low-carb approach offers another way to tackle type 2 that has the advantage of being a lifestyle change that many people find they can keep up. It’s not about calorie counting, but choosing delicious foods — like those featured in Katie Caldesi’s recipes in the Mail this week — that help you maintain your energy levels and lose weight without feeling hungry. As a younger doctor I had the idea that older folk struggled to lose weight because of their slower metabolism. I also thought it would be too hard for them to change. How wrong I was! Results from our practice show that the over-65s lose as much weight as younger patients and their diabetes control improves just as much too! Take Brian Clark, featured in last Tuesday’s Mail. Brian had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 13 years before going low carb in 2018. At the age of 81, he’s lost more than 4st and has been able to come off insulin. Our oldest participant was 91 when she began the diet, losing 9kg and putting her type 2 into remission. This is important when you consider the age of type 2 diabetes patients. Older people are more vulnerable to the side effects of diabetes medication, so non-drug approaches have a particular advantage for them. And this is why so many of my patients who have tried cutting sugar and starchy carbs have stuck to it. To date, 279 of them (142 have type 2) have stuck to a low-carb approach for an average of two years. Many of the early adopters of the diet, such as Chris Hannaway (whose story was told in Saturday’s Mail) are still on it after six or seven years. In fact, Chris would describe it as a permanent lifestyle choice rather than just a diet. Katie and her husband and chef Giancarlo would agree — the Caldesis have been low carb for a total of six years now. One of the reasons people are able to stick to the diet is because low carb can be satisfying and fend off hunger. When we first started doing low carb, we were amazed how many of our patients reported reduced appetite. There is research to support this — a 2011 study in the journal Obesity that looked at appetite in 270 obese patients allocated to either low-carb or low-fat diets for two years concluded that appetite was most reduced on a low-carb diet. And this brings us to what might be behind the rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes — ultra-processed food, and its effect on health. Ultra-processed food is the label given to food that essentially is wholly made up of ingredients that aren’t found in that form or combination in nature. There are four categories: Ultra-processed foods are increasingly coming under scrutiny as a cause of obesity. This may be partly because of their effect on the ‘feel-good’ chemical messenger in the brain, serotonin, which might explain why people find such foods so hard to resist. This was seen in a study in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2019, where volunteers were randomly allocated to eat calorifically matched, minimally processed meals or ultra-processed meals and told to eat until they felt full. Those on the ultra-processed food ate 500 calories more a day and gained weight. More worrying is the possible link with these foods and premature death. A study in the British Medical Journal last year concluded a higher consumption of ultra-processed foods (more than four servings daily) was associated with a 62 per cent increased risk of ‘all-cause mortality’ — deaths from all causes. For each additional serving of ultra-processed food, all-cause mortality increased by 18 per cent. Among my own patients over the years I have seen a steady reduction in the consumption of ‘natural’, unprocessed foods, more than matched by them eating more of the ultra-processed foods. A process we try to reverse in our dietary advice, encouraging them to eat more ‘real’ food by preparing simple meals for themselves from basic ingredients, just as our grandparents did years ago. My rule of thumb with shopping is to be suspicious about anything with more than five ingredients. NOTE: It is important that anyone on prescribed medication for diabetes discusses significant dietary changes with their GP Tuna, cheese & chilli omelette This omelette can be whisked together in less than 15 minutes and is bursting with flavour. Make sure you have a warm plate and everything you need to hand because you will need to work quickly.

Give it a twist of black pepper and serve. Quick ways to build your low-carb meal Keeping things simple makes it much easier to stick to a low-carb diet as a way of life. Most of us haven’t got the time to make dishes from scratch all the time so it’s helpful to have some simple recipes up your sleeve. I love the idea of ‘mix and match’: this is how I put together nearly all meals at home — in a few simple steps — it’s easy. STEP 1: PROTEIN Pick from these protein-rich foods (about 120g meat or fish, 100g cheese, half a tin of pulses or one or two eggs per person). STEP 2: FRESH VEG Choose at least one low-carb veg; you want to fill most of your plate with this. STEP 3: SAUCE Finally choose one of these low-carb sauces: If you make a batch of the tomato-based Quick Italian Sauce or Creamy Mushroom Sauce (both featured in Saturday’s Weekend magazine, Mail Plus and Mail Online) you could either keep a portion in the fridge for up to three days or freeze it until needed. STEP 4: PUDDING Cheese and walnuts or celery, or berries and cream are two delicious ways to finish off an evening meal — and you do not have to cook a thing! My grandchildren love five or six strawberries or raspberries whisked into double cream with a few drops of vanilla essence. If you spoon it into a wine glass, put a couple of extra chopped berries on top with a shaving of dark chocolate it’s good enough to serve at a dinner party. REMEMBER: THE SEVEN RULES OF THE PLAN Use these simple rules to help you stick to your low-carb target. 1. Reduce or eliminate sugar and starchy, high-carbohydrate foods. These include: breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, white potatoes, rice, couscous, crackers, oats, oat cakes, rice cakes, cakes, biscuits, sweets, milk chocolate, fruit juice, fizzy drinks and cordials. 2. Load up with vegetables at each meal. Use non-starchy and salad vegetables, such as broccoli, courgettes, green beans, aubergine and cabbage, to help you feel full without raising your blood sugar levels. 3. Eat good fats. Include oily fish, olive oil, coconut oil, avocado and animal fats — they’re good for adding flavour, as well as for helping you feel full. Add nuts and cheese in moderation only — although nutritious and tasty, they are also highly calorific. 4. Opt for fruit that is naturally low in sugar. This includes berries, apples and pears. Choose these over high-sugar tropical fruits, such as bananas, mango and pineapple. 5. Eat some form of protein in every meal. It’s essential for all your body’s repair mechanisms and helps you feel fuller for longer. 6. Stop snacking. Fasting between meals and overnight helps to improve insulin control. Aim for three meals a day — and then stop. 7. Drink two litres of water each and every day.

"Tom Brady is launching a Hollywood production company as his future with the New England Patriots and NFL career in general remains uncertain. The 42-year-old six-time Super BowlChampion announced via Instagram on Monday that he is launching multi-platform content company named 199 Productions. He wrote: 'I’m excited to announce to the world the official launch of 199 Productions. 'When I was the 199th draft pick in 2000, I knew I needed to work hard every day to prove myself.' Scroll down for video Tom also alluded to his football future as he concluded the statement by writing: 'Stay tuned.. exciting times are ahead, both on and off the field.' As always Brady will have a high-powered team around him as his first project under the new banner will see him joining forces with Avengers: Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo. He wrote:Launching a production company is no different and I’m humbled to have the opportunity to partner with @therussobrothers, @agbofilms and @gchopra on our first project ""Unseen Football."" 'I believe in the essence of teamwork, and I have no doubt, our 199 Productions team and partners will create inspiring content to share with the world.' The project will be a love letter to the sport of football as Brady will be introducing innovative aspects of the game at every level. Following in the footsteps of the late great Kobe Bryant with Granity Studios, Tom's new company will be producing original content including documentaries, feature films, and television shows according to Deadline. According to Deadline, 199 Productions has already put together a roster of development projects that include several with the three-time NFL MVP on-camera om stories spanning sports, entertainment and health and wellness. The company name is an obvious acknowledgement to the fact that Brady as drafted at number 199 by the New England Patriots in 2000 in the second-to-last round. He has since defied the odds leading the team to six Super Bowl Championships (including four Super Bowl MVPs) and 14 Pro Bowl selections. The announcement comes at an interesting time for the sports superstar as he is set to become a free agent for the first time in his 20-year career on March 18 when the NFL's 2020 calendar begins. In addition to the Patriots, Brady has reportedly drawn interest from the New York Giants, Los Angeles Chargers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Las Vegas Raiders, and the Tennessee Titans. As he is the oldest active player in the NFL, retirement is also not out of the question. Brady is currently married to supermodel Gisele Bundchen as last month they celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary.

"An aspiring fashion designer was stabbed to death on the subway in the Bronx in the early hours of Saturday morning by a stranger he held the gate open for, police say. Rudolph Dunning, 25, died after the altercation Morris Avenue Soundview station at around 4:30am. He was found slumped at the bottom of the subway stairs alongside his cousin, who was also stabbed but is currently in a stable condition. Police had issued a plea for help in finding their attacker, issuing security footage of a man, holding a knife, they wanted to speak to in relation to the incident. Ramziddin Trowell, 42, was arrested Sunday evening andcharged with murder, attempted murder, and criminal possession of a weapon, The New York Post reports. DailyMail.com has contacted NYPD for comment. Dunning's aunt Sherry Sutton, 54, told The New York Daily News:'Rudy opened the door for you not knowing you would take his life. 'You asked him to open the door, my nephew opened it. And then you take his f***ing life.It always happens to the wrong person.' It is alleged Dunning and his 28-year-old cousin got into an argument withTrowell as they all waited for a Manhattan bound 6 line train. The victim's mother, Gussie Dunning, said her son, who worked night shifts, was a 'hardworking man', adding: 'It’s just too much.' His cousin, Kiara Dunning, told ABC7: 'He was a family man, never did anything to bother anybody. For someone to do this and hurt out family, y'all took a piece of us when you took him.' Police say Trowellhas a history of arrests for crimes including attempted murder, assault and robbery. He said to have fled the scene before being arrested at around 6:30pm on Sunday. He will be arraigned Monday.",real
"Four pro-Russia militia men accused of shooting down the MH17 aircraft, killing all 298 passengers and crew, have gone on trial for murder today despite still being on the run. The plane was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a surface-to-air missile on July 17 2014. Prosecutors say the suspects helped arrange the Russian missile system used to shoot down the civilian aircraft over territory held by pro-Moscow rebels fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine. The defendants, Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko, each held senior positions in the pro-Russian militias a at the time.The suspects, all of whom are still at large, are believed to be in Russia. The four have waived their right to attend the hearings, which will continue without them, a Dutch court ruled today. 'Many people have long waited for this day,' presiding Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said in opening remarks. 'This tragic loss of so many lives has touched many all over the world. 'The court wants to say it realises the impact of the loss of so many human lives and that the way it happened was almost incomprehensible.' Grieving relatives sat listening with bowed heads and eyes closed, as the names of all 298 victims were read out. 'The silence in this court during the reading of all the names of the victims makes it (MH-17 disaster) clear once again and that means a moment of silence was fitting,' Judge Steenhuis said. The judges' first order of business was to verify whether the suspects had appointed lawyers to defend them and to lay out a timetable for the case to proceed. The aircraft's downing led to sanctions against Russia by the European Union. It also heightened tension between Russia and Western powers who blame it for the disaster, which killed 196 Dutch, 43 Malaysian and 27 Australian nationals, among others. Moscow slammed the 'absolutely groundless accusations' last year, claiming the international community had frozen them out of investigations to discredit Russia. Prosecutors said Girkin was a former colonel in Russia's FSB intelligence agency who was the self-declared minister of defence in the separatist administration in eastern Ukraine. Dubinskiy was a former minister from the Russian military intelligence agency GRU, Pulatov was an ex-soldier in Russia's Spetznaz special forces unit and Kharchenko a Ukrainian separatist. ",real
"The Russian ambassador to Australia has claimed that the country's federal police tampered with evidence from the MH17 plane wreckage. Dr Alexey Pavlovsky believes integral evidence from the Malaysia Airlines flight that was shot down over the Ukraine was falsified by Australian investigators. A total of 298 people were killed, including 38 Australians, when a BUK missile shot down the Boeing 777 from Ukrainian territory held by pro-Russia separatists in July 2014. Dr Pavlovsky claimed that there are flaws in the investigation which was made to reach a predetermined result and blame Russia for the attack. 'The experts say that many of these pictures have been heavily tampered with and it seems that the Australian Federal Police as part of the investigation also had information to this effect but it somehow chose to withhold it from the public,' he told 9News. Scroll down for video Analysts from the MH17 Joint Investigation Team (JIT) included representatives fromAustralia, Malaysia, the Netherlands,Belgium and Ukraine. The JIT have charged Russia's Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov and Ukraine's Leonid Kharchenko with the tragedy, with a trial to begin on Monday. Footage used in evidence by the JIT showed a truck with a BUK missile from the Russian armed forces travelling from Russia to the Ukraine before returning with no missile. Russia has denied this accusation, with Dr Pavlovsky saying it is important to establish the truth for the victims families. 'I saw on the internet some copies of the documents indicating the Australian participants to the JIT at least had some signals on the pictures presented as evidence being falsified,' he said. Dr Pavlovsky believes any evidence that is contrary to blaming Russia for shooting down the plane has been hidden by the Australian and international media. 'The investigation was based on falsified pictures and on the recordings provided by the security services of Ukraine. For me that's quite enough to smell a rat here,' Dr Pavlovsky said. The Australian Federal Police have denied accusations of using falsified evidence. Many questions remain unanswered more than five years after the tragedy. Former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop told the ABC in 2018 that Russia needed to explain why a missile was taken Russia to Ukraine prior to the attack. 'The Russian Federation must answer how it is that a sophisticated weapon, a BUK missile, was transported from Russia into Eastern Ukraine and was used to bring down a civilian aircraft carrying 298 people and then was immediately taken back into Russia,' she said. None of the accused will appear in court because both Russia and the Ukraine don't extradite citizens for criminal trials. Because of this, any sentence imposed may not be served as the Netherlands has no authority over either country. There is a possibility for more people to be charged over the incident, with the accused facing life in jail under Dutch law.",real
"A prototype of the unreleased ‘Nintendo PlayStation’ console has sold for $360,000 (£273,096) at auction – nearly $1 million less than an earlier rejected offer. The super-rare console, which was sold with a Sony-branded SNES controller and cartridge that enables CD-Rom functionality, was sold by Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions on Friday. The collector's item is a rare artefact from a brief collaboration between Japanese gaming giants Sony and Nintendo before they took separate paths in the video game market. The winner bidder was entrepreneur and video game collector Greg McLemore, who beat out other bidders including Palmer Luckey, founder of Facebook’s Oculus VR platform. The previous owner of the prototype had reportedly turned down $1.2 million to put it up for auction – meaning he's missed out on nearly $850,000.  McLemore, the new owner of the prized console, who founded successful retail sites Toys.com and Pets.com, told Forbes that the Nintendo-PlayStation will eventually be part of a video game museum. ‘I’m looking to not have this machine just buried in a closet somewhere,’ McLemore said. ‘I’m interested in sharing my passion for gaming. One of my areas of focus is the evolution of gaming, including how earlier arcade games inspired video games and how early video games influenced later innovation. ‘I believe the Nintendo PlayStation fits in well with this focus.’ McLemore also said that the console seemed ‘inexpensive’ compared to a near mint copy of Super Mario Bros. for the Super Nintendo System that recently sold for $100,150 (£76,057). This particular prototype was originally owned by the founder and first CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc, Olaf Olaffson, who later became a member of the board of directors at Advanta, an American bank. When Mr Olaffson left Advanta he left the prototype behind, and it was later acquired by former Advatna worker Terry Diebold when the company went bankrupt. Though the CD-ROM drive was not working when Mr Diebold acquired the console in 2009, it was repaired by Ben Heck, a YouTube personality known for his console repair videos. Mr Diebold had had the SNES PlayStation in his possession ever since, and toured it at vintage game conventions worldwide before finally deciding to put it up for sale. Mr Diebold told Kotaku back in December that he turned down $1.2 million (around £1 million) from ‘someone in Norway’ to be able to put it up for auction. This means Mr Diebold may have lost out on about $840,000 by rejecting the original offer had it gone through. Palmer Luckey, 27-year-old millionaire, video game enthusiast and founder of Facebook’s Oculus VR platform, had also previously bid on the priceless device. After missing out on the console, Luckey tweeted: 'Do you imagine there are rich people out there who are better than me at preserving videogame technology?' Luckey – whowasn't even born when the SNES-PlayStation prototype was originally revealed in 1991 – also previously tweeted:‘Who are the other nutters who keep bidding against me?' 'The Nintendo PlayStation is very, very cool, but I can only think of a handful of other people who think it is $300k worth of cool.' The unreleased console, which features Sony branding and the first use of the word ‘PlayStation’, marks the first chapter of Sony’s foray into the home console video game market. Nintendo had approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on for its upcoming Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), but the idea didn’t come to fruition before the console’s release in 1990. The companies continued their collaboration nevertheless, culminating in this SNES-PlayStation prototype, which was revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in June 1991. But disputes caused the cancellation of the project shortly after, and Sony went on to launch its wildly successful PlayStation in 1994. This particular prototype is thought to be the last out of about 200 that were made, as the remaining 199 were reportedly destroyed when the partnership soured. The Nintendo PlayStation has a game cartridge slot and a CD-ROM disc drive, both of which are in working order. While no games were officially made for the SNES-PlayStation, the prototype does play CDs and the cartridge slot works for SNES games. A small screen on the top of the console shows the user which track is being played on the CD next to buttons, allowing the user to skip to the next track and and play a cartridge game at the same time. It also has a headphone port and independent volume dial on the front of the console, to the left of the two controller ports. The plastic and flame retardant that were used to make the console have gradually given it a yellowish tinge after 30 years. ‘By far, this is arguably one of the most notorious, mysterious, and controversial artefacts of the video game industry,’ Heritage Auctions said on its website. ‘At one point, this dual-branded prototype's existence was mere myth, and this is the very first time it will ever be offered at public auction. ‘We at Heritage can attest the prototype is working, as we've played a couple of rounds of Mortal Kombat on it using a Super Famicom cartridge.' 1988: Sony and Nintendo originally began discussions to develop a CD-ROM add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The idea didn’t come to fruition before the SNES was released in 1990. 1991: At the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Sony revealed a prototype SNES with a built-in CD-ROM drive – now known as the ‘SNES PlayStation’. However, only the next day Nintendo announced it had broken its deal with Sony, opting instead to partner Philips, Sony’s rival in consumer electronics. 1994: The original PlayStation launched in Japan on December 3 and in the US and Europe the following year. 2000: Sony launched the PlayStation 2 a year before its other competitors, Microsoft’s Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube, and became the most successful home console in the world, selling 155 million units by 2012. 2005: The original PlayStation became the first video game console to ship more than 100 million units. 2006: Sony released the PlayStation 3, the first console in the series to introduce the use of motion-sensing technology. 2013: Sony released the PlayStation 4 (PS4), a next-generation console designed to compete with the Xbox One. 2016: Sony entered the expanding virtual reality (VR) market with the release of the PlayStation VR (PS VR). 2020: Sony plans to release the PS5 around Christmas next year.",real
"A professional dancer whodanced his way into the first stage of cancer treatment has gone viral after his video was praised for bringing positivity to other patients. In uplifting footage, dancer John Christopher Polintan - known as 'JC' - stands in his hospital ward in Philippine General Hospital, in Manila, a drip attached to his arm. As music starts playing in the background the 30-year-old begins to show off some of his best moves, a smile plastered on his face the entire time. 'Warming up before my chemo starts tom. Thanking the Lord for everything despite my situation,' he said, posting the clip on Facebook. The video was captured by JC's girlfriend on February 19, with the song Born To Praiseby Planetshakers playing in the background. JC was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma last July after he initially noticed a lump on his neck during a dance competition in Australia in 2017. Having competed around the world, JC was then told he had stage 4A NPCA in January 2020 when he returned to his native Philippines. According to Jazreel, JC's treatment requires between three or four five-day cycles of chemotherapy before he can then begin radiation treatment. JC, who began dancing aged 14, is currently the artistic director of a dance team, MAD Rush, who he has led to championships in Singapore, Thailand, Australia, the US, and Croatia. When he posted the video online, the dancer received an outpouring of support for his positive outlook, with the video going viral and viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Jazreel said: 'The response of the people to the video has been overwhelming - we didn't expect that it would go viral, and it brought inspiration to many people. 'JC even received messages from other cancer patients that said they were inspired and motivated after seeing the video. 'They admired his outlook on life and how strong and positive he is.' JC, who lives in Las Pinas City, Philippines, said: 'Do not lose hope - I know how difficult it is to undergo chemotherapy and how difficult it is to endure this type of illness. 'That is why I also want to help send positivity to many.'",real
"Vaping giant Juul Labs tried to court state attorneys general and donated tens of thousands of dollars to their election campaigns in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to head off legal challenges as e-cigarette usage among teens surged. A new report from the Associated Press details how Juul, the nation's largest electronic cigarette company, spent months meeting with at least six AGs to push the public health potential of its devices for adult smokers and its 'commitment to end youth use'. In many cases Juul's political action committee gave thousands of dollars to the AGs prior to meeting with them. The PAC also donated $100,000 to Republican and Democratic fundraising committees that supported AG candidates. Juul's push for access proved unsuccessful when 39 states joined an investigation into whether the company promoted and sold its nicotine-heavy products to teens. So far nine states have filed lawsuits against Juul and more may come in the wake of the 39-state probe, which also is examining whether the company made misleading claims about the nicotine content in its devices. In an emailed response to written questions, a Juul spokesman declined to say how many state attorneys general company representatives have met with. Juul, the spokesman said, is working to earn 'the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators' and other officials to combat teen vaping and to steer adult smokers away from cigarettes. The spokesman said Juul reached out to the AGs and donated to their campaigns to 'listen and learn' from them on a range of issues, including cracking down on counterfeit vaping products. Among the AGs targeted in Juul's influence campaign wasGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who announced late last month that his state had joined 38 others to investigate Juul. Ten months earlier, a team of Juul representatives met with Carr and his senior staff and delivered a 17-page presentation laden with information about the benefits of e-its combustion-free vaping devices and its pledge to curb youth use, which included more rigorous retail and online sales controls. The session in Carr's Atlanta offices and meetings with other state AGs haven't been previously reported. The Associated Press uncovered the influence campaign by reviewing Juul's political donations and obtaining internal emails, meeting minutes and company records through open records requests to more than a dozen state attorneys general offices. Juul's political action committee made thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to individual state attorneys general, several of whom like Carr later met with the company's representatives, according to the records. Katie Byrd, Carr's spokeswoman, said a $3,000 contribution Juul's PAC made to Carr's 2018 reelection campaign wasn't a factor in his decision to accept the meeting. The company also donated $50,000 each to the Republican and Democratic fundraising committees that support the election of attorneys general candidates. Those donations won Juul corporate membership in both groups, a status that came with invitations to semiannual retreats and conferences attended by attorneys general and their staff. These events provide opportunities for companies to lobby state officials. The documents shed new light on the unusual connection Juul forged with Iowa's Tom Miller, the longest-serving state attorney general in US history. The records show that Miller served as a behind-the-scenes adviser, helping the company respond to media requests and inquiries from government officials. Miller did not receive campaign contributions from Juul. The documents also provide new details about the advocacy roles that the former attorneys general of Massachusetts and Rhode Island have played for the company, including lobbying state officials. All three would become important messengers as Juul stressed its efforts to keep its products away from minors while simultaneously pitching its technology as an anti-smoking tool. Teen use of e-cigarettes has skyrocketed more than 70 percent since Juul's launch in 2015, leading the Food and Drug Administration to declare an epidemic of underage vaping among teenagers. Health experts fear this unprecedented increase has hooked a generation of young people on nicotine, a highly addictive drug that is harmful to the developing brain. More than one in four high schoolers now reports vaping and Juul is the top brand, preferred by 60 percent of students, according to the latest government data. 'Juul really created this crisis,' said Dr Scott Gottlieb, the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner.'Juul created the pool of nicotine-addicted teens and I think they popularized the idea of vaping among kids.' During Gottleib's tenure, the FDA raided Juul's San Francisco headquarters, seizing more than 1,000 documents related to the company's early sales and marketing efforts, including online promotions featuring young models and celebrities on social media sites like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Juul's meteoric rise has been followed by a hasty retreat in recent months, amid a nationwide backlash over vaping. Although Juul remains the dominant player in the multibillion-dollar e-cigarette market, the company has made several concessions such as pulling its mint, fruit and creme flavors from the market.The company currently sells only menthol and tobacco nicotine pods. Juul also has shuttered its social media presence and halted all US advertising. The FDA and a congressional oversight panel continue to investigate whether the company targeted young people with the flavors, design and advertising of its products. Yet Juul may face an even bigger threat from state attorneys general, most of whom are elected independently and have broad discretion to investigate and litigate. They're especially formidable when they band together. Dozens of them did in the 1990s with litigation against tobacco companies that led to an historic $206billion settlement and new marketing rules that continue to govern how the industry operates. More recently, nearly all states have sued opioid drugmakers and distributors for their alleged role in the addiction epidemic tied to prescription painkillers. 'It means they're in a world of hurt,' James Tierney, a former attorney general of Maine who now teaches at Harvard Law School, said of the multistate investigation. 'The states are not buying what Juul is selling, and they´re saying, ""We need to go deeper.""' The latest of the nine state lawsuits against Juul was filed last month by Massachusetts' chief legal officer, Maura Healey. Citing company records, she alleges that Juul bought advertisements on seventeen.com, nickjr.com, the cartoonnetwork.com and other websites designed for teens and children. Most of the state lawsuits similarly allege that Juul adopted the playbook of Big Tobacco by luring teens with colorful, youth-oriented ads, 'launch parties' and product giveaways. But to date, Juul hasn't faced the same type of coordinated, multi-state lawsuit previously used to target tobacco, pharmaceutical and financial companies. A TOBACCO WARRIOR IN JUUL'S CORNER Juul's unlikely partnership with Miller, the Iowa attorney general, began in spring 2018 as federal and state health officials grappled with the surging popularity of teen vaping. A Democrat with more than 37 years in office, Miller frequently mentions his leadership role in forging the 1998 settlement with the tobacco industry. He's championed vaping's potential to 'save the lives of adult smokers.' The company sought Miller's counsel on how to respond to inquiries from government officials and media outlets. And even as more and more teens were vaping, he urged the public not to 'overreact'. Portions of Juul's interactions with Miller were previously reported by Politico and Vice News. By April 2018, Miller's staff was working to set up a call between the attorney general and Juul's then-chief administrative officer, Ashley Gould. 'He wants a time scheduled with her and put on his calendar,' wrote Miller's executive secretary, in an email to fellow staffers. Two weeks later Miller's office issued a press release titled 'Juul offers opportunity to reduce smoking rates' highlighting the company´s potential to shift smokers away from cigarettes. Days after that, Miller announced a more concrete relationship, saying he would advise Juul on how to keep its product away from young people. In a press statement, Miller said underage vaping was a 'cause for concern,' but had 'not reached panic or epidemic stages.' Miller's new role involved organizing a group of experts to advise the company on underage use. Of the 13 experts Miller assembled for the group, more than half were former attorneys general, including ex-officials from Illinois and Arizona, both states that had recently requested documents from the company. Other members of the group included several researchers and one of Miller's assistants, who would later leave his job to work as a vice president for Juul. The advisory group would hold several conference calls with Juul executives. But one former state official was not sympathetic to Juul's desire to keep its flavors readily available in stores. 'I would support banning the product if you can't do a better job of keeping it out of the hands of children,' said former Arizona attorney general, Grant Woods, according to meeting minutes from an August call. The group held its last meeting in October 2018, according to Miller's office. Throughout the summer, Juul frequently reached out to Miller as negative press accounts of teenagers addicted to Juul's flavored nicotine pods began to appear. In one email to Miller's secretary, a Juul executive requested time to discuss interview requests from 'three top-tier reporters' who had contacted the company. 'I'd love to involve AG Miller but wanted to get your thoughts before I sent the reporters your way,' wrote Juul spokeswoman Victoria Davis. In the following weeks, Juul would seek Miller's input or encourage him to field inquiries from The New York Times, CBS' 60 Minutes and NBC. In April 2019, a positive profile of Juul co-founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen penned by Miller appeared in Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people. In an interview with AP, Miller said he became involved with the company to help 'bring them into compliance' by stopping underage sales of their products and to reduce the toll of smoking on adults. 'If you were going to deal with the question of kids and e-cigarettes, you had to deal with Juul,' Miller said. Miller rejected any suggestions that Juul benefited from its association with him and said he wouldn't hesitate to take legal action against the company if evidence shows wrongdoing. Miller's office hasn't joined the multistate investigation of Juul. Anthony Johnstone, a former assistant attorney general for Montana, said there is little precedent for such a close partnership. 'That depth of involvement by an AG with a single corporation at the center of a public health issue is uncharacteristic,' he said. MONEY AND MEETINGS In mid-2018, as other states began to eye Juul more critically, the company gave $50,000 each to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and its GOP counterpart, the Republican Attorneys General Association, according to financial reports both groups filed with the IRS. The organizations raise money and back candidates from their respective parties that are running for the office. Neither of the groups discloses how they disperse corporate donations to candidates. Those contributions and others would be followed by meetings with at least five state attorney generals, documents obtained through open records requests show. One of those meetings came in September 2018, when Juul representatives met with Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro and four of his staffers for nearly two hours to discuss how to to stop young people from using the company's products. Shapiro's office had called for Juul to pull its fruit and dessert flavors from the market and reduce the high nicotine levels of its e-cigarettes. Yet the company declared these weren't bugs, but features that adult smokers wanted, according to an eight-page memo written by a Juul executive that recounted the conversation. A spokeswoman for Shapiro said members of his staff 'meet with companies to discuss potential violations of the laws' and to see if they will correct them. Last month Shapiro announced that Pennsylvania would sue Juul for allegedly misleading the public about the addictiveness of its e-cigarettes. In late October 2018, Juul's political action committee donated more than $38,000 to incumbent state attorneys general and one first-time candidate for the office, according to a review of campaign finance records. By then, Juul was squarely in the crosshairs of FDA regulators, who were sounding the alarm on teen vaping after survey data showed e-cigarette use among high school students had jumped nearly 80 percent in the past year. Not everyone wanted Juul's money. Kwame Raoul, a Democrat elected in November 2018 to his first term as Illinois' attorney general, rebuffed a $3,000 gift from Juul. Hanah Jubeh, a spokeswoman for Raoul's campaign, said the contribution conflicted with his professional responsibilities and personal views. Raoul's office announced in December it was suing Juul. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson announced last month that he'd joined the 39-state probe of Juul to examine whether the company 'is following the law and not misleading people with false or misleading claims'. Previously, Wilson's reelection campaign had accepted a $3,000 donation from Juul's PAC and he'd met with company representatives in February 2019. Wilson spokesman Robert Kittle said Juul's contribution had no bearing on the decision to grant the meeting. HIRED HANDS Juul enlisted two former state attorneys general, Patrick Lynch and Martha Coakley, as the company stepped up its outreach to current occupants of the office. Lynch was Rhode Island's chief legal officer from 2003 to 2010 while Coakley was the attorney general of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015. Lynch runs a consulting firm that promotes its ability to help clients like Juul 'build relationships and tailor communications' with state attorneys general around the country. When Juul executives agreed to allow Marlboro cigarette-maker Altria to buy a 35 percent stake in their company for nearly $13billion, Lynch sent a letter on Juul's behalf to state attorneys general explaining that his client would 'remain fully independent and entirely focused' on its mission to help smokers, despite the investment from the nation's biggest cigarette maker. Lynch's office did not return repeated calls and emails seeking comment. Juul hired Coakley to be its vice president of government affairs in April 2019. A month later she was among the Juul representatives that met with Chris Carr, the Georgia attorney general. While in office, Coakley joined more than three dozen other attorneys general in writing a letter to the FDA that called for the 'immediate regulatory oversight of e-cigarettes, an increasingly widespread, addictive product'. She has a very different role now. Coakley helps to 'educate state officials, regulators and organizations on Juul's commitment to combating underage use and transitioning adult smokers from combustible cigarettes,' the company said. Her replacement as Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, has a very different opinion of Juul. 'We are going to make them pay for the public health crisis they caused in Massachusetts,' Healey said upon announcing her lawsuit against the company last month.",real
"Ronaldinho's lawyer has said the Brazilian football star was 'stupid' rather than guilty as his client posed for a picture in a Paraguayan prison following his arrest for using a fake passport. Lawyer Adolfo Marin told Brazilian media that Ronaldinho 'did not understand' he was using false documents when he travelled to Paraguay last week. A picture published by Paraguayan media showed the 2002 World Cup winner smiling in a purple vest and a pair of slippers in his cell. Ronaldinho, and his brother and business manager Roberto Assis, are being held over the false documents but prosecutors say there are 'indications that other crimes were committed'. Paraguayan judge Clara Ruiz ordered that Ronaldinho and his brother be kept in custody, saying he was accused of a 'grave and punishable offence against the interests of the Republic of Paraguay'. The judge added: 'There is a flight risk and there is a danger of obstruction. 'We are dealing with a foreigner who entered the country illegally and who remained in the country illegally. 'The prosecution considered he meets all the requirements. He will remain in preventative prison in the Specialised Unit.' 'Specialised Unit' is a term used in Paraguay to refer to a unit in prison designated for high-profile inmates. But lawyer Marin said Ronaldo had been 'stupid' and 'did not know that he was committing a crime'. Sergio Queiroz, another lawyer for Ronaldinho and his bother, refused to comment on a prosecutor's claims that the investigation had been expanded. Prosecutor Osmar Legal had told Brazilian outletGloboesporte that there were 'indications that other crimes were committed'. 'The case as it was presented is clear,' Queiroz said. 'There is no other point being investigated, you can see that there in the documents.' He called the brothers' detention 'arbitrary, abusive and illegal'. 'They confessed that they used these false passports,' Queiroz told reporters. 'But there was no harm done to the Paraguayan state. 'Roberto and Ronaldinho did not know that the passports were irregular. And they cooperated fully with authorities.' Ronaldinho and his brother arrived in Asuncion from Brazil on Wednesday and showed their passports to immigration police, who did not immediately notice any problem with the documents. Hours later, when the passports were determined to be fake, investigators raided the room Ronaldinho was staying in and seized the brothers' identity cards and travel documents. Queiroz said he would ask for the pair to be released and allowed to return to their home country when they next appear before a judge on Monday. 'Ronaldinho did not commit a crime because he did not know that the passport they gave him was faked,' he said. Queiroz claimed prosecutors had agreed that the footballer had acted in good faith and the decision by a judge to order their detention was unwarranted. Ronaldinho said the passports had been given him by people who had invited him to attend conferences sponsored by charities working with disadvantaged children. The brothers were remanded in custody on Saturday after they appeared in court and were accused of trying to enter Paraguay using the doctored travel documents. Under Paraguayan law, officials have six months to complete their enquiry. They were remanded in custody after their court appearance on Saturday. The pair spent Friday and Saturday night in a jail cell in a maximum security facility. They were given soap, pillows and mosquito repellent and were led into court in handcuffs, although Ronaldinho was allowed to cover them with a blanket. The former Barcelona player had been invitedto Paraguay by a local casino owner and arrived to take part in a football clinic for children and a book launch. He was greeted at the airport in Asuncion by throngs of fans. Although he last played professionally in 2015, Ronaldinho is still hugely popular with football fans for his skills and showmanship. He was a cornerstone of Brazil's World Cup-winning side in 2002, and later won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2006. He was named FIFA world player of the year in 2004 and 2005.",real
"It has now been about five weeks since Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianni, and seven others were tragically killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. And on Sunday the basketball legend's widow, Vanessa Bryant, shared a touching new photo on Instagram of their eldest daughter, Natalia, posing in front of a mural of her father and sister. '❤️my babies. Natalia. #winterformal,' she captioned the picture. Turns out mother and daughter were on the way to Natalia's high school winter formal dance in Los Angeles when they decided to stop and pose for the snap. Decked out in a cute blue and white patterned dress, the 17-year-old flashed a big proud smile as she stood in front of the painted mural. It shows her dad giving Gianna a kiss on the top of her head with a golden halo above them. The mural is a version of a famous photo of the pair as they sat courtside at a Lakers game in November 2019, just two months before they passed away. This appears to be the first time Natalia has been pictured since attending the public memorial for Kobe and Gianna at Staples Center, where the Lakers call home. During the emotional event, Vanessa Bryant gave a heartfelt speech as the tears flowed down throughout the arena. 'God knew they couldn't be on this Earth without each other.He had to bring them home to heaven together,' she said with raw and real emotion. 'Kobe, take care of our Gigi. I've got Natalia, Bianka and Capri. We're still the best team.' The Bryants were married for nearly 19-years at the time of Kobe's death on January 26. ",real
"Two U.S. soldiers were killed as they accompanied and advised Iraqi security forces on a raid of an ISIS stronghold. The service members were killed by 'enemy forces' on a mission to knock out the stronghold Sunday in the mountains of north-central Iraq, according to a statement posted online by the Combined Joint Task Force, which commands Operation Inherent Resolve. The military group did not release any additional on how the soldiers were killed. Their names were being withheld, pending notification of their next of kin, in accordance with U.S. Department of Defense policy, the statement said. About 5,200 American troops are currently stationed in Iraq to assist Iraqi security forces as they fight the Islamic state militant group, the Associated Press reports. The US service members are on hand to provide the security forces training as they go after ISIS. There was no immediate comment from Iraqi officials. It's the first deadly hostile incident for U.S. service members this year in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, reports Military.com. The last hostile military death in support of Operation Inherent Resolve was on Aug. 10, when a Marine Raider, Gunnery Sgt. Scott Koppenhafer, was killed. The 35-year-old from Mancos, Colorado,was serving as a critical skills operator with the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion when he was killed in Nineveh province, northern Iraq. In a statement released at the time, the Pentagon said Koppenhafer died after being engaged by enemy small-arms fire while conducting combat operations. Koppenhafer's death was later investigated as a possible friendly fire incident; but ultimately, Defense Department officials said no evidence was found to support that possibility, Military.com reports. The deceased service member is survived by his wife and two children. ",real
"The US Navy is developing a robot submarine that is controlled by artificial intelligence that could kill without human control or input. The project is being run by the Office of Naval Research and has been described as an 'autonomous undersea weapon system' according to a report by New Scientist. Details of the killer submersible were made available as part of the 2020 budget documents, which also revealed it has been named CLAWS by the US Navy. Very few details about the 'top secret' project have been revealed beyond the fact it will use sensors and algorithms to carry out complex missions on its own. It's expected CLAWS will be installed on the new Orca class robot submarines that have 12 torpedo tubes and are being developed for the Navy by Boeing. Scroll down for video The navy has not revealed what CLAWS stands for or commented on the story, the only information is what has been released to congress in the budget documents. Autonomous submarines already exist and they can complete tasks without humans being involved - however they aren't very intelligent and have limited functionality. Anything more complex than a simple location task would require a human operator to work via a remote communications link. The new submarines will have much greater level of artificial intelligence and so be able to perform a wider range of functions without a human controller. CLAWS isn't new, it was first revealed in 2018 as part of a US Navy bid to 'improve the autonomy and survivability of large and extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles', according to New Scientist. When it was first revealed there was no mention then of weapons being on the autonomous submersible, only a need for it to have sensors and make decisions. The US Navy has ordered larger, longer range robot submarines called Orca and it was assumed they would be controlled remotely like the smaller versions. They are set to be armed with 12 torpedo tubes and with CLAWS they could be used to sink targets on their own without input from a human, New Scientist reports. This idea isn't to everyone's liking. Stuart Russell from the University of California Berkeley told New Scientist it was a 'dangerous development. 'Equipping a fully autonomous vehicle with lethal weapons is a significant step, and one that risks accidental escalation in a way that does not apply to sea mines.' The exact budget for CLAWS hasn't been revealed but it was allocated $26 million in this years US Navy budget and another $23 million for next year. It will move from being an idea to a working prototype thanks to this extra funding and could be deployed on large robot submarines by 2022, says New Scientist. While little is known about CLAWS, more information is available on the Orca submarines that could house it. ‘The Orca will have well-defined interfaces for the potential of implementing cost-effective upgrades in future increments to leverage advances in technology and respond to threat changes,' the Navy said. ‘The Orca will have a modular payload bay, with defined interfaces to support current and future payloads for employment from the vehicle.’ If a robot unlawfully kills someone in the heat of battle, who is liable for the death? In a report by the Human Rights Watch in 2017, they highlighted the rather disturbing answer: no one. The organisation says that something must be done about this lack of accountability - and it is calling for a ban on the development and use of 'killer robots'. Called 'Mind the Gap: The Lack of Accountability for Killer Robots,' their report details the hurdles of allowing robots to kill without being controlled by humans. 'No accountability means no deterrence of future crimes, no retribution for victims, no social condemnation of the responsible party,' said Bonnie Docherty, senior Arms Division researcher at the HRW and the report's lead author.",real
"Video loaded onto social media shows federal agents arresting a suspected undocumented immigrant who was doused with pepper spray during a raid in a Brooklyn restaurant. Maria De Los Angel Sanz Pimentel, a Dominican woman who is allegedly in the United States without a work visa, was taken into custody by several Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on March 1. ICE raided the La Cabana Spanish eatery on Flatbush Avenue in the Prospect Park South section of Brooklyn, where Pimantel was said to have been working illegally, according to the New York Daily News. While the incident took place on March 1, video was posted to social media over the weekend by New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie. It shows ICE agents appear to argue with several bystanders inside the restaurant as they took Pimantel into custody. Pimantel is seen pinned to the floor by at least one ICE agent moments after she was pepper-sprayed in the face. During the commotion, one woman is seen inside the restaurant tending to Pimantel and wiping her face as several ICE agents look on. Jenny Sanz, Pimentel’s sister who traveled from her Florida home to New York after she heard about the arrest, accused ICE of using excessive force. ‘They entered where she was, they threw her to the floor and two men were on top of her and they sprayed her with pepper spray,’ Sanz told the Daily News. ‘The violence isn’t necessary. I don’t why they were using so much force.’ Myrie blasted ICE over the raid. ‘The fact that officers would barge in and pepper spray her is outrageous,’ said Myrie. ‘They came here to work and be a productive part of this community... It’s so incredibly painful this is where we are at… we have arrived at a point where if we as a society do not condemn these sorts of actions we will be in trouble.’ ICE, however, claims that Pimentel overstayed a visa that expired on September 22, 2019. On February 25, Pimentel was arrested by the New York Police Department after she got into a fight with a friend at a bar. She was released without bail in that incident. ICE told the Daily News that agents were forced to use pepper spray after Pimentel resisted arrest. ‘A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Fugitive Operations Team discharged oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as OC spray, while attempting to arrest Maria De Los Angel Sanz Pimentel, an illegally present Dominican national,’ the agency said. ‘This was after Sanz Pimentel resisted arrest… ‘During this enforcement action, ICE officers were within the scope of their law enforcement duties and acted with professionalism and respect to ensure the safety of all parties involved. ‘On scene, officers maintained effective communication with Sanz Pimentel and bystanders by ensuring them she would be afforded all courtesy to include a translator during processing. ‘Although the scene became chaotic with bystanders, officers continued to conduct themselves with professionalism to ensure the scene remained safe.’ Sanz said Pimentel was remanded to the Hudson County Correctional facility to await her immigration proceedings. 'She (Pimentel) feels very sad,' Pimentel's sister said. 'She feels afraid because we have never been through anything like this. 'Ijust tell her to stay calm because we will be here for you but she's nervous. 'It's good that her coworkers filmed the incident because now people can see who ICE really is and how they act.' Sanz added: 'Why does she have to be taken and why does she have to be taken in such a violent way? 'She is not a killer. She never did anything.' This is the second time in a little more than a month that ICE's tactics have come under scrutiny after an incident in Brooklyn. On February 6, an ICE agent shot a Mexican national in the face while attempting to arrest his mother's boyfriend. ICE agents were in the process of serving a deportation order to an undocumented immigrant, Armando Gaspar Avendando-Hernandez, 36, of Mexico, when his girlfriend's son, Erick Diaz, allegedly intervened. Diaz reportedly got into a scuffle with the officer on 12th Street in Gravesend, Brooklyn, at around 8.15am on February 6, according to ABC 7. The officer then fired his weapon. A bullet went through Diaz's cheek and became lodged in his neck. Diaz was transported to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Avendando-Hernandez was then Tased and taken into custody. ICE claimed agents were attacked while trying to arrest Avendando-Hernandez.",real
"An actor who starred in the Walking Dead has been jailed for biting a mother-of-two after they met at a UK horror convention. US actor Michael Mundy subjected Beverly Jackson to physical abuse, hitting the 41-year-old around the face and biting her. Mundy, 52, attacked her eight years ago and Ms Jackson said he became even more abusive after their first encounter. After the incident he returned to the US but contacted Ms Jackson two years ago. He asked her if he could stay in her spare room in Manchester when he next visited the UK. Ms Jackson said initially he had been very charming and had promised to get her into films, The Sun reported. She said she fell for him but that he became 'more and more abusive'. Ms Jackson said she was first attacked by Mundy in 2018 in hotel room in Germany. She said: 'He hit me around the face, bit me on the hands, arm and back, kicked me and threw me out of the room.' Mundy was jailed last November after being convicted of assault. He was also banned from going near Ms Jackson. Ms Jackson now fears that he 'won't stop until I'm dead'. Mundy is due out of HMP Liverpool in the next few months. Mundy had appeared in the Walking Dead in 2011 and 2012 as well as in movies such as 'Flight' with Denzel Washington. ",real
"Orange Is The New Black star Yael Stone recently returned to Australia over concerns about the carbon footprint she was creating by travelling to the US to work. And on Sunday, the 35-year-old actress broke down in tears after being asked a question about climate change at the All About Women festival held at the Sydney Opera House. Yael has a one-year-old daughter,Pemau Stone Bancroft, but said she may not have had a child if she had known about the climate impact and the uncertain future they would be born into. 'I'm really, really glad I didn't know what I know now [about climate change], because I don't know if she'd be here,' she said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. An audience member then asked if it was morally correct to have children because of the 'uncertain future' posed by climate change. Beginning to cry, Yael said: 'It's really overwhelming, I'm terrified, [but] I have to use the anxiety I feel to act. 'I do totally hear your question, and I would love to have another kid, but it's hard.' In January, Yael made a stand against climate change by returning from the US to Australia in order to cut carbon emissions from flying often between the countries. She had established a home in both countries after obtaining a US green card but said she could no longer justify her actions in light of Australia's bushfire crisis. In a video posted to Instagram, she said it is not 'environmentally ethical to build a life across two continents'. 'The carbon emissions alone from that flying, it's unethical, it's not right,' she said in the clip. Yael shares her one-year-old daughter Pemau with her partner Jack Bancroft, who founded Indigenous student program AIME. She wanted to have a home birth but but after 18 hours was taken to hospital for an emergency C-section in May, 2018. The actress is best known for playing Lorna Morello on Netflix series Orange Is The New Black, which came to an end last year.",real
"Boeing Co's proposal to leave wiring bundles in place on the grounded 737 MAX has not won the backing of U.S. aviation regulators, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. Last month, Boeing told the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) it does not believe it needs to separate or move wiring bundles on its grounded 737 MAX jetliner that regulators have warned could short circuit with catastrophic consequences. The source said the FAA told Boeing on Friday that it did not agree with the planemaker's argument that the planes' wiring bundles meet safety standards and now it is up to Boeing to decide how to proceed. The FAA said Sunday it ""continues to engage with Boeing as the company works to address a recently discovered wiring issue with the 737 MAX. The manufacturer must demonstrate compliance with all certification standards."" Boeing said Sunday it was in ongoing discussions with the FAA over the issue. Boeing could opt to make a new proposal or move the bundles or try to convince the FAA to reconsider its position, but a U.S. official said it was ""unlikely"" the FAA would reconsider. Boeing and the FAA first said in early January they were reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the 737 MAX, and under certain circumstances lead to a crash if pilots did not react in time. Boeing´s 737 MAX was grounded worldwide last March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months. There are more than a dozen different locations on the 737 MAX where wiring bundles may be too close together. Most of the locations are under the cockpit in an electrical bay. If the bundles pose a potential hazard, regulations would typically require separating the bundles or adding a physical barrier. Boeing has noted in talks with the FAA that the same wiring bundles are in the 737 NG, which has been in service since 1997 and logged 205 million flight hours without any wiring issues. New safety rules on wiring were adopted in the aftermath of the 1998 Swiss Air 111 crash. A company official told Reuters in January Boeing had been working on a design that would separate the wiring bundles, if necessary. Moving the bundles could pose further delays to the return of the MAX, however, a key certification test flight is not expected until April or later.",real
"Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov have reignited their war of words over social media with a heated exchange on Monday. Khabib beat McGregor by submission in the fourth round of their 2018 UFC clash, after which the Russian scaled the cage and attacked his rival's team. The incident intensified the hatred between the pair and McGregor has repeatedly called for a rematch in a bid to get revenge on the lightweight world champion. Khabib has so far refused to be lured into a second bout but did exchange insults with the Irishman on Twitter as the 'Notorious' took aim at his rival. McGregor posted a picture of Khabib scaling the cage enroute to attacking his cornerman, Dillon Danis, after their fight, along with the caption 'STrEeT fiGhT'. His tweet caught the attention of Khabib, who responded by uploading an image of him pinning McGregor against the cage during their bout and captioned it 'Heeelp'. The 31-year-old followed that up with a video of McGregor attacking a man in a Dublin pub and the caption: 'show it to your son and say how good you are on the street fight'. McGregor had the last word in the exchange, with a cartoon image of him and Donald Cerrone embracing after his win over the 'Cowboy' in his comeback fight before Christmas and the line: 'I save my hugs for postfight'. Despite the continued tension between the pair, a rematch appears unlikely in the near future, with Khabib set to face Tony Ferguson in a hotly-awaited bout on April 19. McGregor, meanwhile, is rumoured to be in action again in July in Las Vegas against an as yet unnamed opponent. On Sunday, Khabib's manager Ali Abdelaziz ruled out a rematch with McGregor unless he beats a credible opponent in his next fight. He said:'If Khabib wins on April 18, Conor McGregor is not getting a title shot - simple,' Abdelaziz told ESPN. 'Dana White is the best promoter of all time because he understands fighting and matchmaking. The only way Conor McGregor can fight for a title is if he beats someone like Justin Gaethje. 'If he were to do that, it would be hard to deny him.' UFC chief Dana White recently discussed the 'hatred' between the pair and insisted the rivalry is genuine and hasn't thawed since their fight. 'They hate each other,' he told TMZ Sports. 'If you think you're going to do an interview with Khabib and he's going to say great things about Conor McGregor, it's never going to happen. 'If you interview Conor McGregor, he's never going to say great things about Khabib. They hate each other.' ",real
" The grandparents of the youngest victim of a deadly tornado in Alabama traveled to Tennessee to help those affected by severe storms that hit exactly one year after their family tragedy. Armando 'AJ' Hernandez Jr., 6, was torn from his father's arms and found dead after a tornado ripped through the Beauregard, Alabama, community March 3, 2019. He was among 23 people killed in the severe weather. At the time of his death, relative Tina Melton wrote on Facebook: 'Little AJ didn't make it. He was found but he didn't survive... He was always eager to give hugs and loved his family. They are headed to the children's hospital with his brother. They also lost their home in the tornado with all belongings. Fly high AJ. You have your wings!' Exactly one year later, on March 3, 2020, at least 24 people died in a tornado outbreak that ripped through middle Tennessee, including parts of Nashville. The storms injured dozens and left a trail of destruction. When Bobby and Leanne Kidd saw the news, they understood what those families were going through. 'For the people in Beauregard and us, it was already a hard day,' Bobby Kidd told WTVMahead of a trip he and his wife took Friday to storm-ravaged Tennessee. 'It affected us and hit us hard because we knew what they were going through.' So, the couple decided to pack up a trailer full of supplies and head north. 'I don´t think there´s any other way we could honor our grandson´s name. A.J. would have wanted us to do this,' Leanne Kidd said. 'I think we owe it to all of those wonderful people who helped us, who did so much for our children when we had nothing,' The couple planned to give items they said storm victims would most need, based on their own experience. Toiletries, gift cards, money and food were at the top of the list for those who lost everything. 'So the best thing we can do is to give these people basic necessities,' Leanne Kidd said. The couple was expected to lend a hand for two days, and said they also plan to return to Tennessee next month to offer more help. A GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the family generated almost $11,000 'We live with a renewed sense of purpose every day for the gifts we've been given because we could have buried three, but we only buried one,' Leanne Kidd said. 'What better way to honor our grandson's memory?'",real
"An argument over a parking spot on Sunday led to the fatal shooting of a man outside a high-end Atlanta shopping center in one of the city's most prominent neighborhoods, police said. Atlanta Police Maj. Andrew Senzer told reporters at a news conference that two groups of people arriving in separate vehicles at Lenox Square Mall got into a dispute over the parking space at around 6pm. The groups went inside the shopping center, but the spat escalated when both parties came back outside, police said. During the fight, someone pull out a handgun and shot a 25-year-old man twice in the head. Scroll down for video The victim, who was pronounced dead at the scene, has not been publicly identified as of Monday morning. Four suspects took off in their vehicle, but police say they were involved in a crash while trying to leave the mall. All four got out and fled on foot, but an off-duty officer who happened to be in the area captured one suspect and took that person into custody. It was unclear whether the suspect in custody was the shooter, reported 11Alive. Police are still searching for the other three people connected to the deadly incident. This was the fourth shooting in four months at the upscale mall, according to news outlets. On December 21, a Macy's employee was shot and robbed as she walked to her car in a parking garage, news outlets reported. The following month, an officer shot a man who refused to put down his gun in a parking deck. The man may have been trying to stop a robbery.

"Daniel Craig is about to set pulses racing as he poses shirtless for his last ever Bond interview for GQ magazine. The 52-year-old discussed his anxieties over the script, admitted feeling 'physically very low' was the reason behind the film's five year delay and said he wants another baby. The actor, who returns for his fifth and final outing as the spy in No Time To Die, told GQ magazine: 'I was never going to do one again. 'I was like, ""Is this work really genuinely worth this, to go through this, this whole thing?"" And I didn't feel... I felt physically really low. 'So the prospect of doing another movie was just, like, off the cards. And that's why it has been five years.' His last turn as Bond was in 2015's Spectre, which at the time was reported to be his final outing as the spy. Craig said that the 'physicality' of Bond is ""a preparation, in a way"", because he would not get the script beforehand. 'It's making my head go, ""This is what it's going to be"".' Trying to prepare for a role in one of the most popular film franchises in modern cinema without a script also caused him to have anxiety. He said: 'I have suffered from it in the past. I have suffered because it's been like, ""I can't cope. I can't deal with this"".' The British actor has also told of his regret over not speaking up about the script for the previous four Bond films in which he has starred. He said: 'I've kept my mouth shut before and I've stayed out of it and I've respected it and I've regretted that I did,' he told the magazine. Looking ahead to life after Bond, Craig - who is married to actress Rachel Weisz - said that his future may involve 'having another kid, maybe just being older'. 'But all of these things, I was just like, you know, f*** it. There are other things that are more important.' On future acting roles, he added: 'I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f****** good fist of it.' He said that No Time To Die, which was recently pushed back to be released in November instead of April amid global concern around the spread of coronavirus, will have references to Donald Trump. He continued: 'We struggled to keep Trump out of this film, but of course it is there. 'It's always there, whether it's Trump, or whether it's Brexit, or whether it's Russian influence on elections or whatever... 'There are British people working in the top industries in the world and at the top of those industries. 'We do that, and we are good at that. And somehow we're kind of breaking all that apart. Whether that's breaking from Europe... There is a sort of a nihilism, isn't there?' The film finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help. A mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading to a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. No Time To Die also stars Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas and is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, with a script co-written by Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It will be released in UK cinemas on November 12. Daniel Craig stars in the April issue of British GQ in a global GQ James Bond exclusive. GQ's April issue is available from Wednesday March 11.

"Daniel Craig has confirmed his next James Bond film will be his last, dismissing claims that he 'isn't ready' to walk away from the long-running franchise. After a five year wait the actor is poised to return as the legendary secret agent in No Time To Die, his fifth consecutive Bond film, in November. But he moved to rubbish recent claims that he is open to matching Sean Connery's six official appearances as Bond while hosting American show Saturday Night Live over the weekend. Addressing the studio audience, Craig, 52, said: 'This next James Bond film is going to be my last. But it's going to be one of the best. Because we got Phoebe Waller-Bridge from Fleabag come to help with some of the dialogue.' The versatile actress has won a multitude of awards for her role as Fleabag, a young, angry, confused and sexuality active woman who frequently breaks the fourth wall by addressing viewers directly and ultimately falls in love with a priest. With tongue firmly in cheek, Craig added: 'It's not going to be that different. Every so often I will turn to the camera and I will say, ""the name's Bond, James Bond. Is it bad that I fancy the Pope?"" Craig's confirmation comes amid claims he told his PR team not to market the film as his last 007 outing, despite previously claiming he was done with the action franchise. A source told The Sun: 'I don’t think Daniel is finished with James Bond, despite his previous claims. He was in this same position four years ago after Spectre came out, where he said publicly and loudly that he was done and then, as time passed, he just wasn’t. 'There is something about this part that scratches an itch and he’s not prepared to see it go to another actor yet. 'It’s all going to come down to how No Time To Die is received by the public and if it can become the highest-grossing film in the series. 'If it does, I think Daniel will be good for one more movie. He’s hedging that bet by asking for it not be marketed as a ""finale"" '. Craig has played Bond on four previous occasions over a 15-year period, making him the longest serving actor in the film franchise's 58-year history. But he is still two short of Roger Moore's record seven Bond films, released during a busy period for the franchise in the 1970s and '80s. No Time To Die was due to be released on April 2, but Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have said that 'after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace' it must be delayed. A new release date has been set for November 12 in the UK with worldwide release dates to follow, including the US launch on November 25. News of the delay was announced via the film's official Twitter account. It comes amid growing concerns over the threat of deadly coronavirus which has infected more than 92,000 worldwide and killed 3,110 globally, according to the World Health Organisation.",real
"A bride who was a virgin when she got married has spoken candidly about the agonising condition which left her unable to consummate her union as a newlywed and resulted in a sexless 12-year marriage. Raised in a Christian household where sex before marriage was banned, it took more than five years after her first failed attempt at intimacy with her ex-husband before Kendra Blair, 39, from Oak Grove, near Kansas City, Missouri, was diagnosed with vaginismus. The condition causes the vaginal muscles to suddenly tighten when penetration is attempted and can be painful and distressing. In the meantime, when the hospital insurance verifier tried to have sex, she felt an extreme burning sensation, which made her so distressed she would even hyperventilate. Just 19 when she tied the knot, Kendra said: 'We tried to have sex when we went to bed the day after our wedding, but it just wasn't happening. 'I thought I was just nervous, because I didn't know what to expect. I grew up in a very strong Christian conservative home and sex wasn't something anyone in my family ever spoke about. 'But when I tried to have sex, it felt like there was a bone there that my husband couldn't get through.' After months of struggling to have intercourse, eventually Kendra called her mother to ask for advice. 'She thought maybe I had a thick hymen - the skin surrounding or partially covering the vaginal opening - and just needed to really relax,' she said. 'My husband and I had endured months of frustration and I knew there was something else wrong, but everyone just kept telling me to relax.' Eventually, Kendra confided in her then husband's stepmother, who took her to see a gynaecologist. But the doctor's examination triggered the same reaction as her attempts to have penetrative sex. She said: 'My automatic reaction was to hyperventilate, close my legs, squirm to get away and push the doctor away saying, ''Don't touch me"". 'She told me I'd have to make another appointment and they would put me out, so she could examine me, but I didn't, because she also told me just to relax and stop overreacting. 'She had no idea what the problem was, but I saw her smirk and, whether I was right or not, it felt like she was making fun of me.' Five years passed before Kendra plucked up the courage to see another doctor, during which time her condition started to affect her marriage. She continued: 'It did affect our relationship badly and we ended up splitting up after 12 years. 'We had other issues going on – not just the sex – so we didn't get divorced just because of vaginismus, but it was a factor. 'My ex started getting bitter and resentful towards me because of it. Unsurprisingly, he was very frustrated and questioned whether I was holding out on purpose. 'I think this was because, after a while I stopped wanting to work on it. I didn't want to try to have sex because it causes a really agonising burning pain and that's not fun.' Meanwhile, the second doctor Kendra saw, who diagnosed her with vaginismus, had told her to use dilators to stretch and retrain the vaginal muscles. 'I felt some relief when she told me what I had, because it proved I wasn't crazy,' she said. 'She also told me I was not the only one that had this. 'But I was scared about using the dilators, because I couldn't even insert a tampon. 'Despite his occasional frustration, my then husband was pretty supportive. He stood by me more than a lot of men would, considering that we didn't have sex for 12 years. Vaginismus is a condition that causes the vagina to tighten up during penetration It is an automatic reaction by the body and the individual does not have any control over it If your doctor thinks you may have the condition they may refer you to a gynaecologist or a sex therapist Treatment may include exercises to help the body get used to penetration, relaxation techniques, pelvic floor exercises and talking therapy to help manage your feelings The condition does not necessarily affect the individual's ability to become aroused Source: NHS 'He was getting impatient, though, and had started putting a timeline on having kids. I understood his frustration, but it felt like extra pressure. 'I tried the dilators but failed. I couldn't get any of them in - not even the smallest one which was the size of a small tampon. I just couldn't do it. It was too painful. It seemed like nothing was going to work.' Despairing, Kendra sank into depression - fearing she would never have a normal sex life. She said: 'There were days when I even thought about dying. I'd even tell my husband to go and have sex or kids with someone else. 'I didn't want that, but I just felt so frustrated. 'It didn't help that I was getting older and people were always asking why we didn't have kids yet. 'I've always wanted to be a mother, but the vaginismus was preventing me from getting pregnant.' As Kendra's problems persisted, her self-esteem took a monumental battering. She said: 'Not being able to have sex and fall pregnant - things other people take for granted - left me feeling isolated and broken. 'This condition really messes with you mentally. Normal conversations you hear day to day - about someone being pregnant, or people talking about having sex - make women with vaginismus feel really messed up. 'I felt like I wasn't a real woman.' Sadly, Kendra's marriage ended in 2012, after whichdating was an ordeal. She said:'I had decided to talk about the vaginismus within the first three dates with a man. 'If I waited longer than that it felt like I was being deceitful. Then last year, she met Sean Rice, 38, who works for a plasma donation company. 'I seem to remember chatting to Sean online and sending him a text about it before we even met,' she recalled. 'He said, ""I'm not in it for the sex, I want a relationship with you. We can deal with this down the road"". 'It was an amazing response and one you don't get very often.' The couple, who now live together and will be celebrating their first anniversary in May, have now had penetrative sex twice, according to Kendra. And she puts it down to a combination of Sean's sensitivity and her finding a Facebook support group in 2017 with over 2,000 other sufferers, with whom she has shared stories about everything from diagnosis to treatment. Kendra said: 'My confidence has been boosted a little bit,' she said. 'I don't feel as broken as I once did. 'I've been able to have penetrative sex a couple of times, so that's made me feel less guilty and less like I'm stopping Sean from doing something he wants to do.' Kendra claims that the physical therapy recommended by people in her Facebook group has helped her to become mostly cured. It involves performing pelvic floor exercises to stretch out the vaginal muscles, as well as practising insertion with dilators. 'I knew physical therapy was an option and something I should have considered doing, but I didn't have it before this because I had no idea what to expect,' she admitted. 'When I joined the vaginismus support group, a ton of women had already been going to physical therapy and shared their experiences. That kicked me into action. - they took the fear of the unknown away from me.' Also seeing a physical therapist, Kendra practised pelvic floor stretches for five days. 'I then tried dilating and got to one of my largest dilators with no pain,' she said. 'It felt amazing. At last I didn't feel broken, as I'd clawed back a bit of control.' Kendra fears that many sufferers are still self-diagnosing, because they are not taken seriously, even by the medical profession. She said: 'A lot of women diagnose themselves, because they see the doctor and get told they're overreacting. 'Luckily, physical therapists seem to know all about it and are very sympathetic, but, in my experience, doctors often aren't. 'And it's very belittling to be dismissed.' Now on a mission to raise awareness of vaginismus, Kendra has started her own Facebook support group, which has some 70 members. But her own therapy is proving a lengthy process, with her often taking one step forwards and two back. 'I've met some women who've been able to dilate and once they've got past a certain point have found it's never happened again,' she said. 'But for some of us, we progress and then we have a ""bad muscle day"" and go backwards, which can leave you feeling down in the dumps. 'Along with the physical therapy, I also practice dilation at least five times a week. I find this a struggle, though, because it's not at all enjoyable.' While she is not cured, however, Kendra hopes the progress she has made is taking her one step closer to achieving her dream of having a child with Sean. She said: 'I've always dreamed of being a mother and so have always felt a void there. 'I'm worried about my age now, but Sean and I have decided if we can't have our own biological child over the next couple of years then we will adopt.' Praising Kendra's progress, Sean said: 'I think Kendra is an amazing woman. Feeling broken can be tough and I try to be there for her and give her encouraging words and help her not feel so isolated. 'Being open about it is cathartic for her. Not understanding her own body must been really difficult. Her being open about it and honest is amazing and it helps to build her confidence - and that's what she needs.' If you suffer from vaginismus you can visit Kendra's FB support group here.",real
"A father, son and their dog somehow survived a plane crash after their aircraft landed in a tree while coming in to an airport in Florida. Emergency officials were called to an area near Destin Executive Airport after a smallBeech Bonanza aircraft went down on Sunday. The incident which was reported at 10.08am local time involvedtwo men and a yellow Labrador retriever who were on the plane. The passengers have been identified as a father and son from Kansas who were flying into the Destin area for vacation. Jason Dougherty, 47, of Garden City and Caleb Dougherty, 22, of Salina, as well as the dog flying with them somehow survived without a scratch after just missing the runway and landing in a tree. It is thought that people who were on the ground helped the trio aboard the airplane get out. A Facebook post by the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said: 'Amazingly two men and their yellow Labrador retriever came out of this situation without a scratch.' Their small plane reportedly had engine problems and landed in a tree short of the runway. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have been notified and will be handling the investigation.",real
"Pregnant singer Grimes has been craving cow's milk and butter - despite being a vegan for 20 years. The 31-year-old singer - who is currently expecting her first child with her entrepreneur boyfriend Elon Musk, 48 - has ditched her strict plant-based diet and given into her cravings, to provide her baby with the best nutritional possible. She said the number one thing she keeps craving is a simple glass of milk, and that she has taken to eating bread soaked in melted butter. 'Actually lately the one pregnancy craving I have is just a glass of milk. Which is so weird because I haven’t had a glass of milk in probably 20 years, but lately I’ve just been having a glass of milk,' she revealed. 'Just cow’s milk. It’s probably become clear I’m not vegan during this time. This trying time.' The Delete Forever singer - whose real name is Claire Boucher - never used to eat breakfast before she was pregnant, but now indulges in her own creation called 'butter toast', in which she melts butter in a pan and soaks a slice of toast in the melted liquid. She explained: '[I make] this thing called butter toast, which is where I melt a stick of butter on a plate, and then I put toast, and then turn the toast over so the toast is completely saturated in butter. 'Then, I put a little bit of jam on it and eat that. It's actually incredible.' Grimes has also been eating foods she normally doesn’t enjoy, because she knows its good for her baby. The singer doesn’t like fruit or vegetables, but has been adding bananas and raspberries to her cereal to boost her intake of healthy foods. Explaining her dislike for vegetables in a video for Harper’s Bazaar, she said: 'I actually dislike vegetables pointedly. But they're important to eat. It's just vile. Like, broccoli? Like, what the f**k? It's actually disgusting, I don't know how anyone eats it.' She also added: 'Right now I’m not drinking at all, but I love dark beer. I love a thick beer. 'I also really love kombucha, which I recently discovered doesn’t actually contain anything good for you. I really like… right now, I’m drinking a lot of kaffir.' Grimesannounced that she was expecting her first child with Elon in January and was seen for the first time in public with her burgeoning baby bump at the end of last month. The critically-acclaimed musician was seen heading to a studio in downtown Los Angeles proudly put her growing belly on display in a clinging black velvet midi dress. She recently revealed her 'maternity leave' and alter-ego avatar WarNymph, for the cover ofThe Face Magazine Issue 3. The Oblivion songstress launched heravatar on social media in January in a bid to 'separate her digital persona from her humanity'. An avatar is a figure which is used to represent someone predominantly online, it can also be used for video games and in publications. In her interview with the magazine, Grimes explained thatWarNymph is her 'digital self' and that having an avatar allows her to work both during and after her pregnancy. TheFlesh Without Blood hitmaker, who was promoting her new albumMiss Anthropocene, said: 'WarNymph is my digital avatar, aka my digital self. Everyone is living two lives: their digital life and their offline life. 'I want to untether my two lives from each other for mental-health purposes, haha. And also, for fun.' She added: 'I'm also pregnant. Having a digital body allows me to keep working throughout the later stages of my pregnancy, and after I have my baby, so I can spend more time with them.' Grimes also recently declined to reveal the gender of her unborn child during a Twitter Q&A with fans. The pregnant pop star took to social media on Friday and referred to her baby as 'they' when a fan asked 'you will have a girl or boy?' 'They may decide their fate and identity,' replied the Oblivion hitmaker - who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Elon Musk. Also on Friday, the artist - who earlier revealed she is seven months pregnant - echoed the comments during a YouTube livestream. 'I don't want to say the gender of the baby… because I feel like their privacy should be protected.' 'I don't think they can consent to being famous or being in public,' said the Miss Anthropocene artist. 'And I don't want to gender them in case that's not how they feel in their life. I don't know, I just feel like it doesn't need to be known.' Grimes also revealed during the livestream that she has already picked out a name for her offspring. 'I have a name for the baby, but I don't want to say what it is because everyone I've told it hates it, and everyone's gonna make fun of it,' she admitted. 'But it is, in fact, a genius name and people just don't appreciate it yet because it's too avant-garde.' Grimes - whose real name isClaire Elise Boucher - also fielded questions on music and fashion, among other topics. '[W]ill you ever collab with Lady Gaga?' asked one curious fan, to which Grimes replied, 'If she'd have me ps her new album is f**king good'. And when asked about her 'style icons' the singer-songwriter replied, 'Bella Hadid and Kim Kardashian are rly cool [sic]'. The Canadian indie singer has been in a relationship with tech tycoon Musk, 48, since May 2018. The billionaire venture capitalist is already a father to five sons from his marriage to first wife author Justine Wilson.",real
"A series of stunning photographs have captured the fierce, fashionable, and formidable women of a much-feared African tribe. Remarkable picture of the Mursi tribe, a community of 10,000 people in remote Ethiopia, shows a menacing woman cradling an AK47; a proud wife showing off her dotty 7-inch lip plate; and an elderly woman proudly displaying her impressive seashell attire whilst clutching a lip plate of her own. Another striking shot shows a teenager who has deliberately cut themselves and rubbed ash into the broken skin to make a pattern - a process known scarification. Enormous lip plates, razor blades for deliberate scarring, and assault rifles. It is not what you would expect to find in many women's wardrobe or beauty regime but take a trip to the Mursi tribe in the Omo Valley in east Africa and you can expect to see a woman donning all three. Remarkable shots taken by Italian adventurer and photographer, Gianluca Chiodini, 41, showcase the unique beauty of one of the world's most feared tribes, renowned for their prowess as warriors and capacity for murder. He recently travelled to Ethiopia to document their unique appearance. 'Men and women practice scarifications on the body,' he said. 'They told me that every scar is a symbol of a killed animal or enemy. 'The Mursi are the most warlike tribe on the Omo river and I admit I was a little bit scared.' 'People are urged to stay away in the afternoon because the later in the day, the more likely it is that some people will be drunk - and drunk people with a Kalashnikov in hand are not entirely recommendable. 'I also met a drunk guy in the morning in his tent and gave him some money to prevent problems.' 'I had news from the drivers that the week before they killed a Chinese worker for revenge because a guy from Mursi tribe died due to a truck accident. 'The Mursi are one of the most interesting tribes of the Omo river area in Ethiopia, especially from an aesthetic point of view and in particular women with their labial plates. 'For the polygamous Mursi people, beauty is all in the lips. In fact, the Mursi are among the last populations of Africa to use the labial plate. 'Initially it was thought plates were worn to discourage the abduction of women by slavers, but today it is applied for beauty, to symbolise the sexual maturity of women and the size of the disc is associated with the social ranking of the wearer.' 'It's a matter of pride. And there's always competition to be bigger and better than anyone else.' The lip-plate is a coming-of-age process for women in the Mursi tribe, with a teenage girl traditionally having her bottom lip pierced at around age 15. The cut is plugged with a piece of wood, and once this initial piercing has healed, the girl can begin stretching her lip with clay or wooden discs. The Mursi women often carve their own patterns and designs into their lip plates, which can vary in size. Once healed and stretched, the women suffer no discomfort, and apart from minor effects on her speech, the disc does not impair her health. For scarification, as boys and girls approach their full height, they begin to cut small notches into their skin which heal as decorative scars, called kitchoga, on their chest, in a single arc shape over the breasts, and an 'm' shaped double arc on the upper arm. Cuts are made by lifting the skin with a curved thorn and then cutting the skin with a sharp razor blade - in years gone by, obsidian would have been used. Getting a photo of the Mursi tribe member could be a tense affair - and often costly. 'The Mursi live in the mountains isolated Ethopia and among all the tribes I visited in the area, it is the one that lives in the worst conditions,' added Chiodini, who used the Instagram handle @alfienero. 'There was human and animal waste everywhere. It was not very hygienic.' 'If you want to use your camera, they ask for money for each shot, and then insist you keep taking photos. Only a few of them were courteous, the others looked proudly at the lens whilst making sure to keep count of the number of photographs.'",real
"More than two dozen people, including the trainer of champion Maximum Security, have been charged in what authorities described Monday as a widespread international scheme to drug horses to make them race faster. Trainer Jason Servis, whose stable includes the 3-year-old champion, was charged with administering performance-enhancing drugs to that horse and others. Maximum Security crossed the finish line first at the 2019 Kentucky Derby before being disqualified for interference and has since won four of his five high-profile races. The charges against trainers, veterinarians and others were detailed in four indictments unveiled Monday in Manhattan federal court. Charges brought against the 27 people include drug adulteration and misbranding conspiracy. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman scheduled a news conference in New York City to discuss the charges, which authorities said affected races in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and the United Arab Emirates. Authorities said participants in the fraud misled government agencies, including federal and state regulators, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents, various state horse racing regulators and the betting public. In the indictment, Servis is charged with giving Maximum Security a performance-enhancing drug called SGF-1000, recommending it to another trainer, and conspiring with a veterinarian to make it look like a false positive for another substance. The other trainer, Jorge Navarro, is also among those charged. One of Navarro's thoroughbreds, X Y Jet, earned $3 million in total earnings for its 12 career wins before being killed by an overdose of performance-enhancing drugs. Maximum Security on February 29 won the world's richest race, the $10 million Saudi Cup. Servis is alleged to have given performance-enhancing drugs to 'virtually all the racehorses under his control.' He entered horses in races approximately 1,082 times from 2018 through February 2020, according to authorities. 'The charges in this indictment result from a widespread, corrupt scheme by racehorse trainers, veterinarians, PED (performance-enhancing drug) distributors and others to manufacture, distribute and receive adulterated and misbranded PEDs and to secretly administer those PEDs to racehorses under scheme participants' control,' an indictment reads. Prosecutors noted in indictments that professional horse racing is a $100 billion industry followed by millions of fans worldwide, leading racehorses to sell at auction for well over $1 million. 'A sad day for racing but a long time coming,' trainer Graham Motion tweeted. 'A good day for those who try to play by the rules, we will all be better for it.' According to the indictments, marketers and distributors of drugs known as 'blood builders' to stimulate a horse's endurance have infiltrated the horse racing industry for at least the last decade. Authorities say the drugs can cause horses to overexert themselves, leading to heart issues or death. According to the indictments, other drugs used to deaden a horse's sensitivity to pain to improve the horse's performance could also lead to leg fractures.",real
"The University of Kansas is 'deeply troubled' after learning a massage therapist helping female student athletes is charged with a child sex crime. Shawn O'Brien, 48, has been dismissed from his role at the university - where he has worked since 2015 - and an investigation into possible misconduct is underway. Chancellor Doug Girard and Athletic Director Jeff Long addressed the revelation in a statement on the university’s website. ‘…Since 2015, the therapist has been providing massage therapy services to some of our women’s athletics teams as an independent contractor. His contract has been terminated,’ the statement read. ‘Immediately upon learning of the arrest, we began reaching out to student-athletes and initiated an internal investigation – led by an independent outside entity – into the therapist’s interactions with Kansas Athletics. ‘We will continue our investigation to further understand the conduct of the therapist and determine who, if anyone, knew of inappropriate behavior that may have occurred. O'Brien was first charged with one count of indecent liberties with a child on February 21 after a girl accused him of inappropriately touching her under the guise of a ‘massage.’ He reportedly told the girl not to tell anyone because the massages were ‘really expensive’ and she was 'lucky’ to get one for free. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that O’Brien touched the girl on separate occasions and would begin at her head before he ‘worked his way’ down to her genitals. The incident occurred nearly eight years ago, but University of Kansas officials just recently learned of the allegations. School officials have offered support to student-athletes, parents and staff who may have been negatively affected by the therapist’s connection to the university. According to reports, O’Brien provided massage therapy for the women’s basketball, tennis, soccer and softball teams. However, the University of Kansas has not publicly confirmed which teams O’Brien had contracts with. Until recently, O'Brien was the registered owner of Kamehameha Massage LLC and worked as an independent contractor provided massages for female student athletes. This is the latest sex allegation involving the athletic department at the University of Kansas. Last year, a former volunteer assistant volleyball coach admitted stealing underwear from women on the team. The judge found his crimes were sexually motivated and ordered him to register as a sex offender for the next 15 years. The investigation comes amid reports that an assistant hockey coach at the University of Minnesota may have victimized players decades ago. Similarly, several men alleging sexual abuse by a deceased University of Michigan doctor have retained law firms that are representing accusers who sued Michigan State University and Ohio State in similar cases.",real
"Amanda Knox, fresh off her second marriage ceremony to poet to Christopher Robinson, posted an image on Instagram of her 'hubby for a week'. In the image taken at the newlywed couple's home in Seattle, Washington on Sunday, Knox revealed she and Robinson were having a slice of mackerel avocado toast for breakfast. 'Happy Sunday, everyone!' she added. Knox, 32, who was twice acquitted of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, tied the knot for the second time with Robinson on March 1. The couple had secretly married before that in December 2018. For their second nuptials, the couple along with 100 guests held a space-themed ceremonyat an Elks Lodge in Burien, also in Washington state. Knox sported a bright yellow patterned outfit when she said 'I do' again in front of similarly bizarrely dressed friends. It was not clear in the pictures of the ceremony obtained by DailyMail.com if the husband and wife were channeling any specific sci-fi characters. Guests seemed equally stumped by the theme, with some seemingly misinterpreting galactic for flapper and toga-style costumes. The bride did not wear white, instead opting for the retro loose-fit pants, a blouse and gold waistcoat. The groom matched his accessories to his bride, in an equally unusual departure from tradition, donning shiny gold shoes and glasses and a yellow bow tie. Robinson was pictured at the venue in a long grey jacket with black fur lapels and face jewels. He also appeared to have shaved his beard into stripes for the occasion. The space-themed ceremony followed after Robinson staged a bizarre, ET-themed proposal at their home. The celebration also came after Knox celebrated her bachelorette party late last year with eight of her closest friends. Knox and Robinson had been dating since 2015 when she reviewed his book while she was still engaged to someone else. They have kept quiet about honeymoon plans, with their website reading that 'there are conflicting accounts' about where they plan to go. Knox was found guilty alongside her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito of the brutal murder of Kercher, her roommate in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. Kercher was found dead in the apartment she shared with Knox. The 21-year-old had been sexually assaulted and stabbed in the throat. Knox, who became dubbed by the press 'Foxy Knoxy', and Sollecito was convicted of Kercher's murder and spent four years behind bars in Italy before she was acquitted on appeal in 2011. Knox returned to the US and vowed to never return to Italy. She was convicted for the crime again in 2014 before being exonerated again in 2015 after her conviction was overturned by Italy's Supreme Court, bringing an end to the legal saga. Drifter Rudy Guede was jailed for 16 years for Kercher's murder and sexual assault and remains behind bars. Knox denies any involvement in the murder. She has written a memoir, taken part in a Netflix documentary about the case, and also writes articles advocating for people wrongfully convicted of crimes. Her ex-fiance Sollecito recently announced he is also engaged to his girlfriend Andreea Burtea. While the two were exonerated, Kercher's family has suffered yet more heartache as the murdered student's father John, 77, died in February after being involved in a suspected hit-and-run in London.",real
"A seven-year-old cancer sufferer who has raised thousands of dollars for her fellow patients has been hailed a 'hero' for her bravery and kindness while battling the disease - after what she thought was her first ever pimple turned out to be a rare form ofnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In summer 2019, Lynden Smith, from Rancho Mission Viejo, California, excitedly ran into her parents' bedroom to showstay at home mom, Amanda, 33, and director, Dan, 50, her 'first pimple' on her lower back. However, a week later the pimple had changed shape and color so Amanda and Dan took their little girl to the doctor who gave them medication for an 'infected hair follicle'. Two days later, Lynden developed major swelling in her right groin. This time the doctors took samples and sent them for tests. In late July, Lynden was told she had a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She had cancerous tumors in her chest and groin and was required to undergo six intensive phases of chemotherapy and months of grueling hospital appointments. Instead of feeling scared, Lynden drew a deep breath after receiving her diagnosis before turning to her mom, and asking if she could donate a few dollars to the children's cancer charity box in her local McDonald's on the way home. The heroic little girl's maturity and bravery continued to stun her family, friends, and community as she underwent her brutal treatment for her stage three cancer. When faced with a low point, Lynden poured herself into a creative activity to take her mind off her troubles. She started making bracelets which she called 'Lynden's Lotuses'. Amanda encouraged her daughter's arts and crafts and even began selling the bracelets with all proceeds to be sent to the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation, a non-profit organization that invests in cutting-edge childhood cancer research. Over the last six months, Lynden's Lotuses have raised an astonishing $58,000 for severely sick children. The seven-year-old's positive outlook and sweet nature had made her a role model for sick youngsters across the USA and the world, who follow her on her popular Instagram and Facebook pages. Even better news came through for the Smith family a few weeks ago when Lynden was given the all clear and told that her tumors had disappeared. 'In the beginning of June last year, Lynden came running into my bedroom one night while her dad was tucking her in, turned around, lifted her shirt and said, ""Look mom, my first pimple,""' said Amanda. 'She had what appeared to be a large white head on the lower right side of her back. Over the next week or so the ""pimple"" didn't go away. She had picked at it herself a bit, but it was changing in appearance from a pimple to something much more concerning. 'After about a week I took her in to a doctor to have it looked at. It wasn't our normal pediatrician. He suspected it to be an infected hair follicle and gave us topical and oral antibiotics and told us if it got worse over the weekend to go into Urgent Care. 'By Friday night it wasn't getting better and when she was taking a bath that night, we noticed major swelling in her right groin. We pushed our doctor and eventually had some tests taken but we were told whatever it was would almost certainly be benign. I was told to wait for a call. 'I was with the kids at a trampoline park when I got the phone call. I actually missed it and it went to voicemail. It was our doctor telling us to get in touch as soon as possible and to let us know that she'd booked us in with an oncologist. My heart dropped. She had cancer. 'There is no other reason she would refer a healthy seven-year-old girl to an oncologist. It took everything inside me not to completely lose it in the middle of the park. I was shaking, I was crying and I text Dan 'call me now'. 'The doctor called me back about an hour later and gave me the news. Lynden did in fact have cancer. The lesion they removed wasn't benign but was in fact a cancerous tumor. 'Our whole world changed in that moment. Our daughter has cancer. How do you wrap your brain around that? It is something that happens to other people's kids but not yours. Definitely not mine. We assumed it would only be in her skin and that it hadn't spread and we hoped for the best.' When the full diagnosis came, it was brutal – just one step below stage four cancer which is rarely curable. 'We were informed that she did in fact have Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) - a rare form of blood cancer - but it was systemic, meaning it had moved to other places in her body. They found two tumors in her upper chest near her lungs,' said Amanda. 'It was not stage four because it has not yet entered her bones or central nervous system. I could hardly breathe. I didn't cry. It all sounded so formal and matter of fact and most of it I didn't even understand. There were no emotions, except shock, until Dan asked if she would lose her hair. 'Yes. She would lose her hair. Just over a year ago, Lynden cut off twelve inches of her hair and donated it to children who had lost their hair with cancer. And now she would be that child. 'Then she went over the treatment plan. It was an aggressive chemotherapy that she would need to be inpatient for each cycle. The treatment would consist of six five-day cycles with about two to three weeks in between each cycle. 'I wanted it all to be a big misunderstanding - while other kids enjoyed the summer, Lynden was sat in hospitals, getting poked with needles over and over again. 'One of the first things she asked me when she found out she had cancer was if I'd put money in the box at McDonald's for other kids with cancer. 'In her moment of finding out she had this horrible disease she immediately wanted to help others suffering from the same thing. As a mother, I couldn't be more proud of her. The idea of Lynden's Lotus bracelets came together through both of us. 'We thought maybe we'll sell twenty-six to fifty bracelets to family members at first. We both knew we wanted to help other kids like Lynden who were going through horrible cancer treatments. Our mission is to raise as much awareness and funds as we possibly can for pediatric cancer research. 'We don't want other children to have to go through what she, and so many other kids are being put through to try to save their lives. Our hope one day is that we will look back and be appalled that this was our only option - that putting these children through horrible chemo treatments was the only way to give them a chance at life. 'Each bracelet is unique, they all have Lava Beads, and each one has a Lotus charm attached to it. The Lava stone is a grounding stone that represents stability, strength, and courage. Lotus charm represents life, beauty, and victory. A Lotus flower grows and emerges from dirty, muddy waters to blossom into a pristine, beautiful flower; it will always rise above the darkness. 'I didn't care if we raised $100 or $100,000 - which I never even had a dream of raising that much, and now I realistically do – and it would all go to PCRF so every little bit helps.' However, even though the vast majority of Lynden's medical treatments are hopefully behind her and she has raised tens of thousands of pounds for cancer charities, the seven-year-old is now having to face an entirely new obstacle – childhood bullying. Despite growing up a 'girly girl', brave Lynden is currently sporting short hair as it grows back after she lost it during chemo but after returning to school, she was teased for looking like a boy. 'Recently a boy in another class made fun of Lynden,' said Amanda. 'She has always been a girly girl. She loves getting her hair done, fingernails painted, she wore tutus over all of her clothes, including pajamas her entire third and fourth year of life. 'Being told she looks like a boy wasn't something I ever thought we'd have to deal with. But after phys ed a boy came up to her and asked her if she was a boy or a girl. She said, ""I'm a girl."" And he told her she 'looks like a boy' and then went over and told his friends that 'she was girl but that she looks like a boy'. 'Lynden doesn't know the boy's name, so we haven't contacted the school about it yet but this one is hard. It's hard because it's something she has no control over. It's hard because she's become so confident with her bald head and returning hair. She loves that her hair is coming back. So to be made fun of for it hurts. It's hard. 'Don't we just wish sometimes we could wrap them up and keep them safe forever?' For Lynden, her cancer story has made her stronger than her mother ever thought possible. She now wants to be an oncologist when she grows up. For more information on Lynden's story, please visit www.lyndenslotus.com.",real
"Wincing with each agonised step, and looking as though he might topple over at any moment, the sight of him hobbling on to the stage was pitiful to behold. Hunched over a walking cane and clad in a commodious black outfit that barely concealed the excess pounds, he was unrecognisable as the pop star whose angst-ridden ballads - cheesy and self-indulgent to some critics, yet sufficiently popular to sell 150 million albums - were the definitive sound of the Eighties. Wizened, bald and bespectacled, but admirably stoical and good-humoured, this was the Phil Collins I saw, in poignant close-up, shuffling into a university hall, in Austin, Texas. Not to sing and play the drums, but to give a lecture to a few dozen history buffs on the Battle of the Alamo. Somewhat surreally, the man whose success once rivalled that of Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney is now a world-renowned expert on the fabled fortress siege of 1836, in which 180 Americans, led by Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, defied the full might of the Mexican army. He even believes he may have been reincarnated as one of the heroic soldiers who fought and died in the battle. My close encounter with Collins came three years ago, when I wrote a series about his tumultuous life for the Mail. Since then, I am reliably told, there has been little improvement in his physical condition, despite rigorous physiotherapy sessions and unpleasant electric shock treatment. Having recently marked his 69th birthday, he now suffers from type-2 diabetes; he is deaf in his left ear after decades of performing beside mega-decibel speakers; and nerve damage incurred during an operation has left him with a condition called foot-drop, which makes it difficult to stand up, much less walk. And we haven't even got to the most debilitating of his ailments: the serious back and neck injury that necessitated his spinal surgery. This was caused by frenetically jerking his ageing body, in 2007, as he hammered out a drum solo. Understandably, then, there was widespread amazement last week when Collins announced his intention to tour again, this autumn, with Genesis, the progressive-rock band that first brought him to fame in the early Seventies. Though he can manage only a few gentle taps on the cymbals these days, and will leave his 18-year-old son, Nicholas - whom he taught to play with a fiercely critical eye - to deputise, Collins will croon such hits as Follow You, Follow Me and Turn It On Again while sitting on stage in a bath-chair. Given that he tripped over during a night-time visit to the hotel bathroom on his last concert tour, gashing his head so badly that he required stitches, one imagines the insurance premium will be pretty high this time around. Not that financing it will be a problem; within days of the tour being announced, the demand for tickets was so great that six more dates were added. Despite the obvious risks to his health, however, I understand that Collins has made the decision to re-form the band with the blessing of his family. Having divorced 12 years ago, he and his Swiss-Thai third wife, Orianne Cevey, are back together; and speaking exclusively to the Mail from her home in Switzerland, last week, her mother, Orawan, 78, said: 'It's really exciting news. 'When I was in Miami, seeing my daughter and the family, in the summer, it was talked about. Phil thought it would be a good thing to do. 'My grandson, Nicholas, may be only 18, but even Phil said he's very good, and he's getting more experienced. Phil is very proud of him and says he will love to go on tour with him.' Doubtless so. But the question is, why does the ailing Collins - who first announced his retirement in 2010, saying he was no longer up to the rigours of performing, only to make a torturous solo comeback seven years later - feel compelled to push himself to the limits one last time? It is a conundrum his former mother-in-law seems at a loss to answer. 'Oh, I haven't really asked him that,' she said ponderously. Though the Genesis reunion tour is expected to generate millions, we can assume Collins isn't doing it for the money. When he and Orianne divorced, he was forced to pay her £25million in alimony, and her lifestyle is famously extravagant. However, he is still enormously wealthy. Four years ago, his fortune was conservatively estimated at £110million; more recent reports suggest it could be double that amount, and as his records continue to accrue vast royalties, it is surely rising. He and Orianne live in a vast, sumptuously refurbished, Spanish-style beachfront villa in Miami, bought for $33million (£25million) from the singer Jennifer Lopez. They share it with Nicholas, his brother Matthew, 15 (when he is home from his Swiss boarding school), and Andrea, Orianne's nine-year-old son from a subsequent marriage, more of which in a moment. Moreover, a few years ago Collins felt flush enough to donate his entire collection of Alamo memorabilia - a priceless historical treasure-trove - to the State of Texas, with the proviso that they built a new museum to showcase it. So, what is driving him? Having spoken in the past to many people who know what makes him tick, including his first wife, Andrea Bertorelli, former friends and employees, I can hazard some guesses. For one thing, Collins, despite his undoubted talent, has always been deeply insecure, finding it hard to believe he ever belonged in the rock pantheon, despite his many hits. In 2002, at a Buckingham Palace party, he cringingly asked Paul McCartney to autograph a Beatles biography that he had brought with him. Afterwards, McCartney cruelly mocked him for this, referring to him as 'Little Phil'. Down the years, Collins's work has also been derided by 'serious' rock journalists and stars with more 'street-cred', such as Noel Gallagher. Therefore, one theory holds that Collins, who ranks alongside McCartney and Michael Jackson in terms of record sales, is reuniting Genesis in a final bid to win the critical acclaim commensurate with his commercial success. Then again, one well-placed source ventures that Collins, who has always used work as a refuge from his personal difficulties, might be seeking a diversion from unresolved matters that continue to bedevil him after three tempestuous marriages. He remains at loggerheads with his first wife, Andrea, who threatened to sue him over allegations he made in his 2016 autobiography, Not Dead Yet, and who resurfaces periodically to criticise Collins's past behaviour. A child prodigy who starred as the Artful Dodger in the West End production of Oliver!, Collins met fiery Latino beauty Andrea at stage school when they were 11. They married in 1975, and, after Genesis found acclaim, moved into in a fine country house, near Guildford, Surrey. However, their marriage came under increasing strain. Collins was often away on tour, leaving Andrea at home to care for their two young children, Simon and Joely. As I discovered, in her loneliness and desperation, she had two affairs, and, by her own admission, came close to a breakdown. Her first fling was with Michael Burberry, a scion of the Burberry fashion house. Their brief romance began when he worked as a painter and decorator at the Collins house, while looking for work as a theatre director. When she confessed to Collins, she says, he flew into one of the 'vein-bulging' rages to which she became accustomed. Later he took more cryptic revenge - once placing a pot of paint, with a brush protruding from it, on his piano or amplifier when he appeared on Top Of The Pops. Andrea also had a more serious affair - with Old Etonian Charles Edward Chichester Eustace, the great grandson of the writer and historian Hilaire Belloc. Her infidelity inspired Collins's first solo LP, Face Value - which became known as 'the divorce album'. It included lacerating lyrics aimed directly at Andrea, such as: 'If you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand.' However, though the singer later blamed her for the break-up, she countered that he had been serially unfaithful to her, and told me that she divorced him on the grounds of his adultery. Following the publication of his autobiography, she accused Collins of 'seriously damaging' her reputation and causing her 'considerable distress'. It isn't known whether she carried out her threat to sue for libel, and if so how the case was settled. Collins is believed to be on better terms with his second wife, Jill Tavelman, the daughter of a wealthy, Californian tailor-to-the-stars, who caught his roving eye when he played a concert in Los Angeles, and who was married to him from 1984 until 1996. Nonetheless, he lives with a damning public accusation, made three years ago by their daughter, the acclaimed actress Lily Collins - that the emotional anguish she had suffered as a result of her father's break-up with her stepmother, Orianne, in 2008, triggered the eating disorder anorexia nervosa. Though she and her father are now on good terms, she said it had stirred memories of his divorce from her mother, Jill, when she was seven; a painfully brutal split that created lurid headlines in the red-top tabloids. This famously involved Collins declaring the marriage over, in those pre-email and text message days, by sending Jill a coldly worded fax which found its way into the newspapers. Which brings us to Orianne: the source of so much joy - and so much heartache - in Collins's later years. I first revealed the full, extraordinary story behind their on-off-on-again romance in my series for the Mail. But last week I learned that the acrimonious fall-out continues even now, perhaps placing more strain on the fragile Collins. He was 46 when he fell for Orianne, 24 years his junior, after she was sent to be his interpreter when he played a concert in Switzerland. The romance proved to be a public relations disaster, and has been blamed for the decline of his career. In the eyes of his fans, Collins, by his perceived maltreatment of Jill, lost his Mr Nice Guy image. He was also branded a tax-dodger for setting up home in Switzerland with his mistress - in a year when he had earned £25million. They married in 1999, had two sons, Nicholas and Matthew, and appeared the picture of contentment. In truth, however, their age gap was proving to be insurmountable. He wanted to stay at home with their sons, while she was an avowed party girl. So, in 2006, the third Collins marriage hit the buffers. Orianne very quickly found a young, handsome husband, Belgian-Moroccan interior designer Charles Mejjati, whom she married in Las Vegas in 2008. Collins, for his part, slunk into lonely despond in Switzerland, and says he lay about all day, drinking himself 'horizontal'. In his autobiography, he described feeling suicidal, and in his mid-50s he became so dangerously ill with pancreatitis that, while being treated, he heard discussions over his sickbed about whether he had made a will. However, he recovered and swore off the bottle. He then began regularly visiting Orianne - who had given birth to a son by Mejjati - and their children in Miami. An insider tells me that Collins and Mejjati even became friendly. But all that changed when Orianne suffered a serious spinal injury, and it was Collins, rather than her husband, who nursed her back to health. Their love was rekindled, she left Mejjati and, when Collins bought Jennifer Lopez's mansion in Miami, Orianne moved in. She is still there. However, for the past four years, Orianne and ex-husband Mejjati (they were divorced in 2017) have waged what one of the lawyers involved described as the nastiest domestic case he has known. Having fought an internecine battle over the custody of their son (which they now share) last week the Mail uncovered the latest documents relating to their protracted legal wrangle, filed in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court. They show that Orianne and Majjeti are still in dispute over the luxurious, £6.5million home they had bought in 2012, in Sunset Islands, Miami Beach. A £1.15million loan was secured against the property, and JP Morgan bank has filed a lawsuit for repayment against Majjeti. For Collins, who was summoned to give a sworn statement when the divorce was being contested, and who fiercely supports Orianne, this protracted affair cannot be at all pleasant. Those who know him say that, until a few months ago, he seemed to want nothing more than to sit on the touchline watching his younger son play 'soccer', tinker in his music studio with Nicholas, and read up on the Alamo. According to her mother last week, Orianne and Collins are 'very much in love'. Indeed, she envisages a time, perhaps after their children have moved away, when they will remarry. Yet their lifestyle differences clearly remain. While his former wife, now 45, is every inch the glammed-up Florida socialite, attending fundraisers for their Little Dreams Foundation - a charity that helps underprivileged young people fulfil their musical ambitions - and running her upmarket jewellery store, the reclusive Collins is seldom seen. It leads one of the couple's former employees to wonder whether he is going back on stage out of ennui with his daily existence. 'Phil is a lovely guy, and he makes the best of his ill-health, but I think he's plain bored and lonely,' said the source. 'He and Orianne lead very different lives - she is a social butterfly while he is the opposite. 'His most exciting days were spent playing music on the road and getting the adulation, so I'm guessing he wants one last shot of adrenaline.' This may be the closest we'll get to an answer. Whatever his motivation, it will be moving to see this frail and complex man shuffle back into the spotlight for what will surely be his last hurrah. Love Phil Collins's music or loathe it, no one should doubt his sheer courage. Davy Crockett would undoubtedly doff his raccoon fur hat out of respect.",real
"A plastic surgeon from Ohio drugged several women and then filmed himself raping them while they laid motionless, according to authorities. Manish Gupta, 49, is alleged to have solicited sex online from a woman during a 2016 trip to Los Angeles for a plastic surgery convention. The high-end escort believed that she was drugged and raped by Gupta. She went to a rape treatment center, where she was administered a rape kit, according toWTVG-TV. She also took an at-home drug test that tested positive for benzodiazepine, a psychoactive medication that is commonly referred to as tranquilizers, according to WTOL-TV. Afterward, the woman learned that several other escorts who offered their services on the same site also complained about a man who matched the description of her assailant. The women alleged that they were drugged and raped and that the man videotaped the incidents without their permission. An investigation by the FBI found that in 2014, an employee who worked at Gupta’s clinic in Toledo found several SD cards that contained video clips of the doctor having sex with unresponsive women. The employee alerted another individual, who then told the FBI. On Friday, federal and local investigators obtained a search warrant for Gupta’s home, car and his two offices in Lucas County, Ohio. The investigators said they found several sex toys, camera equipment, SD cards and a large quantity of medications that are not normally used in the practice of plastic surgery. Gupta, who was booked into Lucas County Jail on Friday afternoon, has been charged with illegally dispensing controlled substances, aggravated sexual abuse and sex trafficking.",real
"Saudi Arabia released images of King Salman carrying out his royal duties on Sunday, after a stunning purge of at least three princes including his brother and nephew for allegedly plotting a coup. The brother and nephew of the Saudi king were arrested on Friday over a plot to oust him and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason. Saudi royal guards detained the trio, in a move that signalled Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tightening grip on power. They were taken from their homes early on Friday by black-clad royal guards, the Wall Street Journalreported. The Saudi royal court accused the two men, once potential contenders for the throne, of 'plotting a coup to unseat the king and crown prince' and could face lifetime imprisonment or execution, the newspaper said. The detentions also raised speculation about the health of the 84-year-old king and whether Prince Mohammed's succession to the Arab world's most powerful throne was imminent. But the official Saudi Press Agency posted photos of the king presiding over the swearing-in ceremony of newly appointed Saudi ambassadors to Ukraine and Uruguay. A source close to the Saudi leadership said on Saturday the 'king is healthy and fine' and the detentions were meant to enforce 'discipline' within the royal family. The crown prince is 'in control' and the purge was carried out 'after an accumulation of negative behaviour by the two princes', this source added without elaborating. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were detained after they were accused of plotting a palace coup aimed at unseating the crown prince, heir to the Saudi throne, sources said. Prince Nayef's younger brother, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef, was also detained, they added. The detentions mark the latest crackdown by Prince Mohammed, the king's son who has consolidated his grip on power with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and businessmen. He is already viewed as the de facto ruler, controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy. Prince Nayef, a once powerful figure as head of Saudi counter terrorism efforts, had been crown prince until 2017. King Salman took away the title and put his son - Prince Mohammed bin Salman - first in line for the throne. The New York Times also reported his and Prince Ahmed's detention, adding that Prince Nayef's younger brother, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef, had also been detained. Prince Mohammed has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October 2018. Prince Ahmed, born in 1942, is a brother of King Salman of Saudi Arabia. He served as deputy minister of the interior from 1975 until 2012 and was briefly the full minister. At the beginning of the 2000s, Prince Ahmed was seen as one of the potential candidates to succeed King Salman. However, in 2014, he was effectively excluded from the line of succession when, instead of him, prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz was appointed deputy crown prince. Prince Ahmed then left Saudi Arabia to live in London. In 2018, just before he returned to Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of theKhashoggi scandal, the prince courted controversy over remarks h made to protesters in London. They had been chanting against Saudi royals over the kingdom's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Yemen. He told them: 'What does the family have to do with it? 'Certain individuals are responsible... the king and the crown prince,' he said, according to a widely-circulated online video of the incident. The comment was seen by many as rare criticism of the kingdom's leadership and its role in Yemen, but Prince Ahmed dismissed that interpretation as 'inaccurate'. He was accused of ordering the journalist's murder, and the killing sparked calls for him to be replaced as Crown Prince. He was also accused of hacking the phone of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos after the pair swapped numbers. Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 84-year-old father King Salman. 'Prince Mohammed is emboldened - he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,' Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation, said of the latest crackdown. 'This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone - including royals - not to cross him.' Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy. Just before his return in October 2018, the prince had courted controversy over remarks he made to protesters in London chanting against Saudi royals over the kingdom's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Yemen. 'What does the family have to do with it? Certain individuals are responsible... the king and the crown prince,' he said, according to a widely-circulated online video of the incident. The comment was seen by many as rare criticism of the kingdom's leadership and its role in Yemen, but Prince Ahmed dismissed that interpretation as 'inaccurate'. Prince Mohammed had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, in 2017 to become heir to the Arab world's most powerful throne. At the time, Saudi television channels showed Prince Mohammed kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence. Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities. The same year that Prince Nayef was stripped of his crown prince status, Prince Mohammed ordered a sweeping crackdown, arresting senior members of the royal family and billionaire businessmen. He claimed it was a bid to tackle corruption. The group of the country's most powerful figures were held in a function room at the Ritz Carlton hotel in their home country. Pictures showed them sleeping on mattresses on the floor. A source told MailOnline at the time that the men were being strung up by their feet and beaten by American private security contractors. Among those arrested on allegations of corruption was Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Saudi King's nephew who is worth more than $17bn according to Forbes, and owns stakes in Twitter, Lyft and Citigroup. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 60, was previously a very powerful figure in Saudi Arabia. A nephew of King Salman, he was previously the crown prince of the country between 2015 and 2017, when he was stripped of the title by the king. His role as crown prince had made him first in line to the throne, but he was replaced by Mohammed bin Salman, who ordered his arrest. The prince had also served as minister of the interior and had headed up the country's counter terrorism efforts. But his dramatic downfall in 2017 saw him stripped of all his roles. It was claimed at the time that he was stripped of his status as crown prince because he was addicted to pain killing drugs. The prince went to school in the US and went on to develop a close relationship with American officials, becoming known as the 'prince of counter terrorism'. He led Saudi Arabia's war on Al Qaeda and in 2017 was awarded a medal by the CIA, honoring him for his alleged contributions to counter-terrorism. He was stripped of his position as National Guards chief. The Saudi crown prince, according to the source, also confiscated more than $194 billion from the bank accounts and seized assets of those arrested. The source said that Salman, often referred to by his initials MBS, was conducting some of the interrogations on the princes and billionaries himself. 'When it's something big he asks them questions,' the source said. 'He speaks to them very nicely in the interrogation, and then he leaves the room, and the mercenaries go in. The prisoners are slapped, insulted, hung up, tortured.' Prince Mohammed did win plaudits from Western leaders after he introduced some moderate reforms - allowing women in Saudi Arabia to drive for the first time ever and introducing cinemas to the country. The Crown Prince - also known simply as MBS - also reined in the country's fierce and ultra conservative religious police. Leaders including Theresa May and Donald Trump have rolled out the red carpet for him during his lavish visits. The latest detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam's holiest sites to contain the novel coronavirus. The kingdom has suspended the 'umrah' year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj - a key pillar of Islam. The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with the plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is known as the true power behind the throne in Saudi Arabia. His father, King Salman, was made ruler in 2015, and his son has been given a huge amount of say in how the country is government. He won plaudits from Western leaders after he introduced some moderate reforms - allowing women in Saudi Arabia to drive for the first time ever and introducing cinemas to the country. The Crown Prince - known simply as MBS - also reined in the country's fierce and ultra conservative religious police. Leaders including Theresa May and Donald Trump have rolled out the red carpet for him during his lavish visits. But the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Instanbul in 2018 severely damaged his reputation. MBS was accused of ordering the journalist's murder, and the killing sparked calls for him to be replaced as Crown Prince. While the Saudi authorities publicly insisted the Prince does not have blood on his hands and did not order the killing, his reputation was been badly tarnished. He also has directed the Saudi war in Yemen, where the kingdom has been accused of breaching international human rights law and plunging millions into famine. Questions were already raised about how ruthlessly he will crush opposition after he imprisoned Saudi royals in the country's five star Ritz hotel in 2017. He said he locked them up in a massive anti-corruption drive. But his critics said that the move was a way for MBS to purge his political rivals.",real
"ANew York Times journalist who dated Lady Gag's new boyfriend for seven years is speaking more about the unique experience after an essay she wrote on the subject went viral last month. Lindsay Crouse, 35, aSenior Staff Editor at the Times, revealed in an opinion piece in February the day after the Super Bowl, she discovered that her exMichael Polansky was 33-year-old Gaga's new 'mystery man' — but despite the news being somewhat unsettling, she's managed to use it as motivation to live a better life. Speaking on the Today show this month, Crouse explained how the experience has helped her 'pull the illusion of celebrity down' and find the positive in social media. Gaga and Polansky, a Harvard graduate who runs the Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, had likely known each other for some time before they got together. They were first spotted together in Vegas over New Year’s, and then, ahead of her pre-Super Bowl 2020 concert, they were pictured kissing in Miami. In her viral New York Times essay, Crouse described what it was like to suddenly see photos of Gaga with her ex in gossip magazines, on news websites, and on Lady Gaga's own Instagram page — and how it wasn't actually as traumatic as one might expect. 'When I first saw [them together] I was like, ""Oh... how do I compare myself to the most famous person in the world? You know, so there was a little bit of that moment of, ""huh,""' she told Today. 'And then I realized, actually, it could be an advantage,' she went on. 'You can have these positive comparisons anywhere.' She said that it was 'kind of funny,' since Gaga is 'so in a different, sort of, league than me', but then she began to realize all of the positives she could take from the situation. 'I was like, actually, this is kind of amazing,' she admits. Now, 'instead of thinking, ""Why not me,"" when I look at a celebrity, I thought, ""Wow, in many ways that actually was me at one point."" 'And I felt like it really did pull the illusion of celebrity down.' Crouse was actually on Today to promote an essay she wrote about running in her 30s — and how she recently trained to try toqualify for the US Olympic marathon team. While she didn't end up making the cut, she did run a marathon in two hours and 53 minutes. But Crouse's essay about Gaga' boyfriend proved too fascinating for the Today hosts and NBC's Harry Smith to pass up discussing. Readers were intrigued and impressed by her story, and how well she handled such an unusual situation. Crouse had written that after her ex — whom she dated through college and for several years after — was spotted with Gaga during Super Bowl weekend, her friends 'I was eating bodega grapes at my desk on a recent Monday morning, gearing up to wrangle my inbox, when my phone started buzzing,' she recalled of the moment she was alerted to her ex-boyfriend's new romance. 'While I’d been watching the Super Bowl on television in New York, they were snuggling in her private box at the Hard Rock Stadium at Miami Gardens,' Crouse continued. 'There were the paparazzi as he escorted her away, her pink hair flowing and sequins pasted around her eyes.' Crouse then explained how things changed overnight. Unsurprisingly, Gaga's new relationship became the source of a steady stream of headlines across almost every major media outlet, and Crouse shared that even her mother read about the couple 'after checking People magazine out from their local library'. Crouse isn't friends with Polansky on Facebook; he'd blocked her after they broke up. So she was hardly keeping tabs on him and wasn't used to his presence in her life. But while she didn't follow her ex on social media, she did follow Lady Gaga — and it wasn't long before Polansky, whom she described as 'normal', popped up in her Instagram feed. 'I don’t follow my ex on social media,' she said. 'Then I scrolled through Instagram and saw a post from Lady Gaga: she was sitting in her new boyfriend’s lap. 'Friends from college liked it — along with nearly three million others.' Crouse noted that she is hardly the only person to find out her ex is with someone new and feel the urge to compare, joking that there are likely few people out there who have managed to refrain from Googling an 'ex's new partner', whether they are doing it out of curiosity, or to see how they stack up against them. But of course in her case, she is going up against a superstar. 'Ideally the ex’s life didn’t improve too much without you? In this case, though, that’s all upended. How do you compare yourself with Lady Gaga?' she wrote. While this might have sent many people into a spiral of self-doubt and insecurity, though, Crouse embraced it as inspiration to be her best self. 'Lady Gaga is amazing. Comparing yourself with her is incredibly motivational, and I recommend you try it, regardless of how you relate to who’s dating her.' She said that shortly after learning about her ex's famous new flame, she was headed to a party and planned to re-wear a dress she'd donned dozens of times before. But, realizing that Gaga 'would never do something like that,' she went shopping and treated herself to an expensive dress. 'I’ve never owned anything that costs more than a week’s worth of groceries — whereas she is a woman who wears raw meaton the red carpet,' Crouse wrote. 'I went to a nice store I’d never been inside before and I tried something on. The clerk asked me what the occasion was. I found out from Facebook that my ex-boyfriend was dating Lady Gaga, I told her, and she looked me up and down. ""Huh,"" she said. ""Really?""' The writer and running enthusiast also got her makeup done, upgraded to a large coffee just because she wanted it, and forwarded praise she got at work to her boss. Crouse said it's 'so easy' to get complacent in life, but Lady Gaga's ambition is worth embracing. 'If Lady Gaga can do what she wants, and even expand on what she wants, why not me, too?' she asked.

"Contact lenses capable of allowing a colourblind person to tell red from green without a bulky pair of sunglasses are being developed. Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel say their contact lenses can restore lost colour contrast and improve colour perception by a factor of ten. The lenses are particularly for people who have problems telling the difference between red and green - known as deuteranomaly. It involves a tiny gold ellipse material being embedded in an off-the-shelf contact lens to correct the condition that primarily occurs in men. The team hope to be able to expand their new technology to allow for any type of colour blindness to be treated from a single contact lens. Scroll down for video To create the lenses the teamincorporated ultra-thin optical devices known asmetasurfaces with the type of contact lenses you buy off the shelf. The new type of customizable lens could offer a 'convenient and comfortable' way to help people who experience various forms of colour blindness, the authors said. 'Problems with distinguishing red from green interrupt simple daily routines such as deciding whether a banana is ripe,' said Sharon Karepov from Tel Aviv University. 'Our contact lenses use metasurfaces based on nano-metric size gold ellipses to create a customized, compact and durable way to address these deficiencies.' Finding a way to 'print' these metasurfaces on to a curved surface is what has enabled them to make it available on contact lenses. They haven't been tested on people yet butbased on simulations of colour vision deficiency, their new metasurface-based contact lens can restore lost colour contrast and improve colour perception up to a factor of 10. Deuteranomaly, which occurs mostly in men, is a condition in which the photoreceptor responsible for detecting green light responds to light associated with redder colours instead. Scientists have known for more than 100 years that this vision problem can be improved by reducing detection of the excessively perceived colour. Unfortunately achieving this correction in a comfortable and compact device is challenging and so far limited to bulky sunglasses, the team said. 'Glasses based on this correction concept are commercially available, however, they are significantly bulkier than contact lenses,' said Karepov. 'Because the proposed optical element is ultrathin and can be embedded into any rigid contact lens, both deuteranomaly and other vision disorders such as refractive errors can be treated within a single contact lens.' The biggest problem was finding a way to 'print' the correction filters on to the lenses and that is where 'metasurfaces' came in. They are artificially fabricated thin films designed with specific optical properties. Metasurfaces made of nanoscale gold ellipses have been extensively studied in the past few decades and can be designed to achieve specific effects on the light transmitted through them. 'We developed a technique to transfer metasurfaces from their initial flat substrate to other surfaces such as contact lenses,' said Karepov. 'This new fabrication process opens the door for embedding metasurfaces into other non-flat substrates as well.' Although clinical testing would be needed before the contact lenses could be marketed, the researchers say that manufacturers could embed the metasurface during the moulding stage of contact lens fabrication. The metasurfaces could also be thermally fused to a rigid contact lens. They plan to keep studying and improving the transfer process and test it for other applications beyond treating colourblindness. The research has been published in the journal Optics Letters. Approximately one in 20 people suffer from colour blindness, a condition that makes the world a duller place to look at. According to the NHS, it affects 1 in 200 women in the world and 1 in 12 men. There are four kinds of colour blindness known as protanopia, dueteranopia, tritanopia and achromatopsia. Protanopia Protanopia involves defective or absent long-wavelength cones in the retina; these photoreceptor cones are responsible for the perception of red light. Protans find it difficult to distinguish between red and green colours, and also between blue and green. Deuteranopia Deuteranopia is a condition where the green photoreceptor cone is missing from the retina. As a result, it is much harder for deutans to distinguish green from red, as well as some grays, purples and a greenish blue. Along with protanopia this is one of the most common forms of colour blindness. Tritanopia Tritanopia is a complete lack of the short-wavelength cones in the retina that receive blue light. People with this very rare form of colour blindness confuse light blues with greys, dark purples with black, mid-greens with blues and oranges with reds. Achromatopsia People with total acromatopsia cannot perceive any colours at all and can only observe the world in black and white and shades of gray. The retina of the eye has two types of light-sensitive cells; rods and cones. Both are found the layer at the back of your eye which processes images. Rods work in low light conditions, but cones work in daylight and are responsible for colour. People who have colour blindness have a problem with the cones in their retina.",real
"Amazon will start selling technology used to power its cashier-less convenience stores to other retailers. According to Reuters, the e-commerce giant said it has 'several' signed deals with customers it would not name and that anew website will invite others to inquire about the service which is being called 'Just Walk Out' technology. Unlike the company's Amazon Go stores which also offer a cashierless experience, shoppers will insert a credit card into a gated turnstile to enter, rather than scanning their Amazon app. Items picked up by a customer and any guests who enter with them will be added to the shopper's virtual cart. The store will then bill the credit card once the person or group leaves the store - no bar code scans or checkout lines necessary. The news follows Amazon's first cashierless grocery store which opened in Seattle, Washington last month. Dilip Kumar, Amazon's vice president of physical retail and technology told Reuters that Amazon will install the technology enabling the service, including ceiling cameras and shelf weight sensors at retailers' stores, whether they are new locations or retrofits, and it will have a 24/7 support line. 'This has pretty broad applicability across store sizes, across industries, because it fundamentally tackles a problem of how do you get convenience in physical locations, especially when people are hard-pressed for time.' The move will mirror other efforts to build out Amazon's internal capabilities such as warehouses to help with package delivery and cloud technology to support its website and then turning those into lucrative services it offers others. Reuters reports that Kumar declined to comment on the service's business model or pricing, saying, 'a lot of those are bespoke deals.' In addition to expanding the services offered by Amazon, it would also increase reliance on Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud that underpins its checkout-free systems. Still, high demand is by no means certain. Other vendors including Grabango and AiFi are offering automated checkout to retailers, which in the past have been loath to hand deals to their rival Amazon that has been the biggest disruptor of their brick-and-mortar businesses. Reports have suggested Amazon was in talks to bring its technology to airport stores, for instance, rather than to Walmart or Target. Kumar said Amazon 'potentially' could sell the service to retail rivals but would not speculate. One issue that may arise is who owns the shopper data, something that businesses typically want in order to tailor marketing offers and build their customer base. Reuters reports that Kumar would not discuss whether or how Amazon would integrate this into retailers' loyalty programs but said, 'These are the retailers' customers.' Additionally, labor unions representing retail workers have cautioned against the adoption of such technology, saying that it endangers the livelihood of workers everywhere. 'Amazon represents a clear and present danger to millions of good jobs. Despite the failure of their Amazon Go stores, it is clear that Bezos is determined to pursue a ruthless strategy that is designed to destroy millions of grocery worker jobs,' saidUnited Food and Commercial Workers Union President, Marc Perrone in a statement last month. 'At a time when millions of Americans are already struggling, when most Americans are one paycheck away from disaster, what does it say that Bezos wants to create stores that serve food and groceries and eliminate the jobs real people need.'",real
"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs there are now ""four confirmed deaths"" connected to the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in the UK A patient in their 70s has become the fourth person to die from coronavirus in the UK, a health department spokesman said on Friday. The UK health department said the four deaths were linked to the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak. Two of the deaths have been confirmed, and the third is under investigation, the spokesman said. The four deaths were confirmed on Thursday by the UK's National Health Service (NHS).

One of the deaths is believed to be that of a 75-year-old man from London, whose name has not yet been released.

The deaths were linked to the deadly coronavirus, which was first detected in the UK in October, and which has been spreading across Europe, the Middle East and the Americas.

The health department said it had taken the ""necessary measures"" to ensure that those infected with the virus were treated swiftly and appropriately, and that all those with the virus were being monitored.

The health department said it had ""reopened"" its investigation into the deaths of four people in the UK, and was working to identify the source of the outbreak.

""The UK health and social care systems have been put at significant risk and we have taken the necessary measures to ensure that those with the virus are treated swiftly and appropriately,"" the statement said.

The health department has said it will have to assess the risk to the public from the virus, and said there was no evidence that it posed a public health threat.

"EXCLUSIVE: Poplar and Limehouse in east London is just a few minutes walk away from Canary Wharf - one the biggest financial districts in the world - yet more than half of the children there are living in poverty It's just minutes away from one the biggest financial districts in the world yet it has the highest level of child poverty in the country

This is not the first time that the high cost of living has been shown to be a factor in child poverty.

In a study published in 2012, researchers found that one in three children in London are living in poverty, while one in five are on benefits.

The study found that children living in London had a cost of living of £5,332 per month, while those living in the boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Hackney and Waltham Forest were all on £4,593.

The average cost of living in London was £21,924 in 2012, compared to £23,724 in the UK as a whole.

Meanwhile, an analysis published in 2014 showed that the average household income in London was £38,050 in 2011, while in the UK as a whole it was £28,610.

In addition, the study found that one in four children in London was in poverty in 2011, while in the UK as a whole it was one in five.

It comes as research from the London School of Economics (LSE) found that there was a significant increase in the number of children living in poverty in London over the past five years.

In 2011 there were 1,812 children living in poverty in London, compared to 1,722 in 2011.

In contrast, there were 797 children living in poverty in London as a whole in 2011.

I thought it might be worth mentioning that lemonade has the same sugar content as soda, and the same fat content as a can of soda. So if you're not a huge soda drinker, you should be able to drink a lemonade without getting sick of it.

Well, I have a friend who loves lemonade, and she told me that the real difference is the sugar content. Soda contains the same amount of sugar as soda, but it's much sweeter and has less of a ""sweet taste"" than lemonade.

So, I did some more research, and found this post on Amazon:

As far as the sugar content of lemonade goes, they are both quite similar. There are no differences in the sugar content of lemonade. You can get any kind of lemonade at any grocery store, and they will usually have a variety of sugar content, but the majority of it is fructose.

So, if you're drinking a lemonade, and it's sugar-sweetened, don't worry about it being too sweet, because you're only drinking fructose. And don't worry about the taste, because there are no calories in the drink.

And, since the sugar content is the same, most people will not get sick of the taste of sugar-sweetened lemonade, unless they are drinking it regularly.<|endoftext|>DETROIT -- The Detroit Red Wings have recalled forward Ryan Sproul from the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League.

"Vet Janey Lowes had a glam WAG life with her professional rugby player boyfriend in Newcastle until she went to save street dogs in Sri Lanka and win at Animal Heroes My life five years ago is unrecognisable from the one I lead now. I was in the fourth grade when I met the charismatic, mischievous and talented Natty, and we became fast friends. She is the personification of my love of animals and I know she will always be my favourite pet. Natty was a fantastic companion for my younger brother Steve and I when we were young and we adopted her as a puppy. Natty became our lifelong best friend and we were so fortunate to have her as a pet. Natty's commitment to her owner, Steve, who has worked for years to raise money for animals in Sri Lanka, was the reason why Natty was taken from me in the worst possible time.

Natty's heart had been broken by the death of her beloved owner and I was devastated to learn that Natty had been euthanised.

Natty's life was saved through my actions and Natty's love of animals and Steve's commitment to animals. Steve and I have been together for 26 years and we are lucky to have been able to raise money for animals in Sri Lanka.

"Bob Weighton, from Alton, Hants, says he's lived 'long enough' but is worried about his relatives contracting Covid-19 and has taken to washing his hands more frequently after the outbreak  The world's oldest man today admitted he's 'worried' about the coronavirus - but insists it's not as bad as the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic - and is hoping for a cure

Hans-Joachim Low, 65, from Hessen, is suffering from mild to moderate arthritis and has been taking anti-inflammatories for the past two months

He said: 'I have not had any symptoms. I just felt really ill. I've been taking anti-inflammatories for two months and I've not had any symptoms. I'm not worried about that.

'But I'm worried about the fact that I'm getting older. I've lived long enough, and I've been doing my best to get well. But I'm not going to be able to do that for very long.'

He said he was 'not really worried about it' but is still worried about his relatives contracting Covid-19 and has taken to washing his hands more frequently after the outbreak.

Dr. William H. Booth, from the American Society for Clinical Microbiology, said: 'It's been an extremely difficult epidemic. The risk of the virus spreading is very, very high.

'There are some who are very healthy. The virus is very, very difficult to find and very hard to treat.

'It is a very serious epidemic that has been very, very hard to prevent.'

The disease is caused by a coronavirus that is passed from person to person through the air, with people who have been infected for more than two years coughing up droplets.

The virus is found in the nose, throat and mouth, and is passed on by coughing, sneezing and talking.

The death toll from the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic was more than 9,000, and more than 50,000 people died in the United States from the disease.

Dr Booth said it is likely the virus was spreading rapidly, with cases hitting more people in the winter, and people who are coughing up droplets at night may be at risk of contracting the disease.

'What we need to do is to get people in touch with their health care providers and to get them to test their own noses and their own throats,' he said.

'If they have a cough or sneeze or their tongue is dry, we should be able to find out who has the virus and who doesn't.

'We need to get people to get tested. This is the main thing we need to do.

'We are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening to anyone else, but we are not going to be able to prevent it from happening to anyone else.'

"Spring 2020 looks set to an exciting season for TV viewers, with dramatic new shows such as Honour, Quiz, Four Lives and The Undoing You know what they say? They'll come back.

It's that sort of season of a show that makes us believe in it. We're not talking about The Bachelorette or The Bachelorette Australia. We're talking about a season that features a single season of five dramas in a row.

Here are five things you need to know about this year's debut season of The Bachelorette.

1. It's going to be a long season

The ABC's season of The Bachelorette has been airing for just over a year now, and it's already shaping up to be a very interesting one.

The show has already seen a total of 15 episodes, and we're sure there will be more to come.

""We are absolutely thrilled with the new season of The Bachelorette, and it is a season that we feel is perfect for us and our audience,"" said the show's executive producer, Julie Bowen.

2. It's going to be huge

It's not just the number of episodes. The sheer scale of the new season is going to be huge.

The show is set to hit a peak in its fourth season, with an average audience of around 2.5 million viewers, up from 1.6 million last season.

3. It's going to be a new show

If you've ever watched a reality show, you're likely familiar with the clichéd line, ""It's a new show, you know.""

This year's show is going to be a different kind of show, one that's very different from anything you've seen before.

It's not going to be another reality show.

It's going to be a new show that takes place in a world that is much different from the one that we have now.

4. It's going to be new to fans

This is the first season that the show is getting a UK audience, which means that it will be much more of a hit for the UK than the US.

The show is also the first Australian show to air in the UK.

5. It's going to be an unexpected hit

The show has already done incredibly well, but it's never been a show that has been picked up by the major networks.

The Bachelorette is going to be a huge hit with Australian audiences, and it's been a big hit with US audiences.

Now that the show has launched in Australia, it's just the beginning.

U.S. District Judge Ronald Mosley in Baltimore on Wednesday dismissed the lawsuit filed by the four patients, including one who was diagnosed with epilepsy and two who are suffering from Crohn's disease.

Mosley said the plaintiffs have not met their burden of proving the state's medical marijuana laws are unconstitutional.

The defendants, all from Washington, D.C., have said the state's medical marijuana laws are not intended to be a medical necessity.

Mosley said the plaintiffs have failed to show the state's medical marijuana laws are in conflict with federal law.

The plaintiffs argued that the medical marijuana laws violate their Fourth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection under the law.

Maryland's medical marijuana laws, which took effect in November, allow people with certain illnesses to use the drug for medical purposes. The state also allows individuals with certain debilitating conditions such as Crohn's disease to use medical marijuana for medical purposes.

Pogba has been outstanding this season, but with only one striker he doesn't get the chance to play. The one-man show is something the club would like to see more of, but there is no substitute for the performances of the other strikers.

Manchester United's Jesse Lingard celebrates scoring against Swansea City

The Portuguese has scored eight goals in his last nine Premier League games and has scored in six of those games, including the winner against Swansea City.

""We have to be a better team and we have to try to create more chances for him,"" United manager Louis van Gaal said. ""We have to give him more chances to score goals, because he is a very talented player.

""The reason why we haven't scored more goals in the league is because he has been so good. He has been our top scorer in the league this season, he has scored a lot of goals. He's not going to score more goals if we do not score goals, and it is the same with our defence.

""We have to be better because he is a top player, and we have to give him more chances to score goals. He has to score more goals, and that's what we want. I am happy for him, because he is one of the best strikers in the world.""

Pogba has been superb for United this season, scoring in seven of his last eight games

The problems at United have been, as expected, in the defence. With Jesse Lingard out for three months, Chris Smalling, Juan Mata and Rafael has been playing as the centre-back pairing, which has not been ideal for the club.

Van Gaal's side have struggled to get the ball past Swansea's better defences this season, with United having conceded nine goals in the league in their last three games.

The absence of Lingard, Mata and Smalling has meant that the team has been forced to rely on Smalling's ability and determination to keep Swansea at bay, which has been a problem.

Pogba has been a key figure in United's success this season

The case involves a New York man named Syed Farook, who had been shot dead by police in December 2012. He had been on a government-sanctioned counterterrorism watch list, and the government has said that he was an active member of a terrorist cell that was plotting a terrorist attack on the city.

The government had argued that Apple was an easy target because the company had been making many of its devices for the government. It also argued that the company's assistance would be necessary to provide it with technical expertise to help crack Farook's iPhone.

But the court ruled that Apple's cooperation would not be required for the government to seek a warrant from a judge, because the company's lawyers had already provided the government with information that would allow them to try to break into Farook's phone.

The ruling will come as a blow to the government, which has been trying to win Apple's help in the case. The government has argued that the company should be compelled to help break into Farook's phone.

""Apple's conduct in assisting the FBI in its investigation of the San Bernardino terrorist attack was the most important and prudent step that the government could have taken in the face of such a threat,"" the court said in its opinion. ""Apple did not and did not provide any assistance in the investigation of the San Bernardino terrorist attack that was of a criminal nature.""

The court said that it was important to distinguish between the government's assertion that Apple should have been compelled to help break into Farook's phone and the fact that the government had provided the company with information that would allow it to try to break into Farook's phone. The court said that the government's ""engagement in the Farook case"" was not a way to require",fake

""It's a big change from the current system where you need to wait until you're under a self-imposed self-imposed self-imposed limit of two hours to order.""

The new restrictions on self-isolation would mean supermarkets could make deliveries on Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays.

The paper, published in the journal PLOS One, suggests that the study suggests that the emergence of cities as economic hubs around the world is linked to a strong rise in immigration.

The authors also found that the region's population density of 10,000 people per square kilometre rose by about 2 per cent between the 1950s and 1980s, but was stable after the 1990s.

""The 'Asian cities' that appeared in the 1970s and 1980s had not yet had the opportunity to develop into economically vibrant cities,"" Dr Bong, who is based at the University of Oxford's Centre for the Study of Cities and the Environment, told The Independent.

""The fact that they did so at the expense of the rest of the world suggests that the rise in urban population is largely the result of immigration, rather than the other way around.""

Professor John Keegan, of the London School of Economics, said: ""The rapid spread of cities in the last two decades has been remarkable.

""As cities become more economically vibrant they also create new demand for people to live there, and this creates demand for more housing and infrastructure.

""The increase in urban population is also largely the result of a combination of migration and other factors, which may not be fully understood.

""This paper demonstrates that the rapid spread of cities in the last two decades is largely the result of immigration, rather than the other way around.""

""It is important to note that this research does not prove that the 'Asian cities' were a direct cause of the global economic boom in the 1970s and 1980s.

""However, it suggests that the spread of cities around the world is partly the result of immigration, rather than the other way around.""

The study looked at how the number of people living in cities has changed since the early 1990s.

Researchers looked at the annual number of people living in cities, and then compared it with the number of people living in non-urban areas.

The researchers found that in the UK, where the population is rising by 1.2 million a year, the number of people living in non-urban areas has doubled.

"Russia has been accused of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to help advance its criminal interests and to “go after” Vladimir Putin’s enemies in London, MPs who drew up the Russia report suppressed by Boris Johnson were told.

The former foreign secretary has been accused of using his office to facilitate the lobbying of influential figures in the UK to lobby against the EU sanctions.

His efforts have been described as ""shameful"" by MP David Davis, who said the government should be ""unashamed"" of the fact that it had ""aggressively pushed for the re-establishment of an unelected and unaccountable EU"".

Mr Davis, who was the No 10 minister when the report was drafted, said the foreign secretary's role was ""obviously"" important and ""could not have been done without the expertise and support of the parliamentary committee"".

""The committee's report is in stark contrast to the position of the prime minister, who on 13 March 2015 said that 'the threat from Russian aggression is real' and that 'Russia is not just a threat to Europe, but to the world as a whole.'

""Mr Cameron has repeatedly stated that the UK will remain a strong partner in Europe. But his decision to join forces with Russia in imposing sanctions on Ukraine and furthering his own personal interests in the region is a dangerous step backwards for the UK.

""There is a need for the government to explain why it is willing to go to war with Russia, when the UK is one of the only countries in Europe to be consistently clear that Russia is not an ally and should be condemned by all nations, including the EU. The prime minister should be ashamed of his actions and that of his cabinet.""

Labour MP Chuka Umunna said the report was ""shameful"" and that the government had ""put on the table an agenda of war and conflict"" which was ""unacceptable"".

""This report shows that Boris Johnson and his ministers are playing politics with the lives of ordinary people,"" he added.

""The government has committed itself to a policy of war and conflict, which is unspeakably dangerous, and will not stop until Russia is destroyed.""

The report by the Foreign Affairs Committee was drafted by the parliamentary committee chaired by Mr Davis.

The report found that ""Russian influence operations are intended to influence public opinion, undermine democracy and undermine the UK's security"".

It said: ""It is the UK government's policy to support and encourage the activities of Russian-speaking business, political, media, and other entities, as well as individuals, who engage in such activities.

"Alex Salmond believed three of the women who accuse him of sexual assault and intent to rape had consented to sexual contact, the jury at his trial has heard.

Mr Salmond, a former First Minister, denies the charges.

The women, all former Labour supporters, told the jury they were assaulted between 1980 and 1991, when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.

One told jurors she was raped by Mr Salmond in a car at a house party in Aberdeen in the early 1980s.

The jury heard Mr Salmond had a 'sexually deviant' behaviour and had wanted to have sex with her.

The jury also heard that Mr Salmond was involved in a sexual relationship with another woman, the same age as Ms Williams.

The trial heard that Ms Williams was also a former Labour supporter, but she left the party in the early 1990s.

The jury was told that Mr Salmond made several attempts to have sexual contact with Ms Williams, who was then 14 and working as a receptionist at the city's Royal Academy of Art.

The jury was also told that Mr Salmond tried to have sex with Ms Williams and two other women at his house in the early 1980s.

Mr Salmond's defence lawyer Andrew MacKinnon said it was 'not about this case being about sex or the allegations' but 'about a man who was always violent and was not a good father'.

Mr MacKinnon said: 'I am not going to get into the details of the alleged assaults because that would be ridiculous.

"Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for 15 minutes on Monday because stocks tumbled so drastically in the first few minutes as a result of global coronavirus panic and an oil price war sparked by Saudi Arabia's oil production cuts.

The trading halt was the latest in a string of embarrassing incidents involving trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

On Friday, a trader from Russia's Kaspersky Lab was accused of rigging the market on the NYSE, after a large number of traders moved their orders to an incorrect currency, according to reports.

On Monday, it was revealed that traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were warned by the US Securities and Exchange Commission that they could lose up to $100,000 if they attempted to sell their positions in the futures market, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The SEC said it was investigating a suspected insider-trading scheme.

On Monday, traders at the NYSE were forced to stop trading for 15 minutes after the price of crude oil shot past $100 per barrel, Reuters reported.

The panic in the market caused a spike in the price of oil, the biggest one-day drop in the world's oil sector since July 2011, and has pushed the price of the Brent crude oil futures contract to $106.88, according to the New York Mercantile Exchange.

A similar incident took place in London in December, when traders sold orders for $11 billion in British pound sterling to prop up the pound against the dollar.

In addition to the trading halt, traders were warned by the SEC that they could lose up to $100,000 if they attempted to sell their positions in the futures market, the Wall Street Journal reported.

""We're taking this seriously and will be pursuing appropriate action,"" a spokesman for the SEC told Reuters.

""The NYSE has been involved in a number of high-profile incidents over the past few years, including an incident in October 2011 in which traders sold orders for more than $100 million to prop up the British pound against the dollar, and a $13 billion manipulation case in February 2012 that resulted in the largest trading loss in the history of the NYSE.""<|endoftext|>(CNN) Donald Trump said Tuesday that the US is on track to ""win"" the global economy if he becomes president and said that he is ""totally against"" the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.

"A physician's assistant who became New Jersey's first case of coronavirus has spoken out about the disease from his hospital bed and warns others to take the threat seriously.

""It's a death sentence,"" Dr. Carl van Oster, who treated William D. Salomon, Jr. at the University of New Jersey Hospital in Newark, said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters.

""I've had people say, 'I'll never get cancer again. I've never seen anything like this,'"" said Dr. van Oster, who also serves on the board of the National Institutes of Health. ""And I've been told by several doctors that they've never seen anything like this.""

Salomon, the owner of the pharmacy pharmacy at the corner of New Jersey Avenue and Fourth Street in Newark, died Sept. 23 from the virus, which has killed more than 1,300 people since it was first detected in December.

New Jersey has reported more than 2,500 cases of the virus since the beginning of the year, including more than 300 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus can spread from person to person through contact with blood, saliva and other bodily fluids, such as vomit or droplets from contaminated clothing.

""The virus is incredibly lethal,"" said Dr. Anand Swaminathan, chief of the infectious diseases division at the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services. ""It can kill you in an instant.""

Salomon was among nine patients who were treated in Newark after the outbreak was first reported in December, including three who died, according to the state Department of Health. The others were hospitalized in Newark and other communities across the state.

Salomon's death is the fourth in New Jersey. In January, a hospital employee died from the virus.

New Jersey's Department of Health has not issued a public health advisory about the Salomon case, but the agency has warned that people with high-risk lifestyles, such as those with heart disease or diabetes, should avoid contact with people who have been exposed.

""You're not going to die if you get the disease,"" said Dr. Swaminathan. ""The risk of dying from this virus is very high.""

A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the virus is much more likely to cause illness in people who have a history of heart disease or diabetes, which is why those with those conditions are at greater risk for the disease.

Doctors who treat people with Salomon's illness are taking a second look at their procedures, said Dr. Thomas V. Morgan, director of the University of New Jersey Medical Center's Center for Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Infectious Diseases.

"Saudi Arabia slashed its oil export prices over the weekend and declared a price war with Russia that sent global markets reeling and marked the sharpest decline in oil futures since 1991.

The oil price cut was one of several steps Saudi Arabia has taken in recent weeks to punish Russia for its support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has killed millions of people in the country's civil war.

Saudi Arabia and its allies are also calling for sanctions against Iran for its alleged support for the Syrian government. Tehran denies supporting Assad, who has been backed by Russia and Iran.

The oil price drop, which has since been reversed, has been a blow to the U.S. shale industry, which has been growing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad.

Saudi Arabia's crude oil output fell by 14 million barrels per day, or about 2 percent, to 10.2 million bpd, the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a statement on Saturday.

The reduction was mostly due to a ""temporary increase in production due to a lower crude oil price,"" the Opec statement said.

In a separate statement, the International Energy Agency, a U.N. agency that sets energy policies, said production in the U.S. dropped by 9.4 million bpd, or about 2 percent.

The decline in U.S. production follows a 12 percent decline in global oil output in the first half of the year.

The drop in oil output ""is a direct result of the OPEC decision to reduce production and the U.S. shale producers' lack of the capacity to compete with the rising prices,"" said Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi.

The drop in production from the U.S. shale industry is the result of a slowdown in U.S. production from the Marcellus shale formation, a deepwater formation that extends from Pennsylvania to Maryland, Naimi said.

The shale revolution has also pushed up prices for American oil, as well as for other key producers such as Canada and Mexico.

But some industry experts say that although the decline in production has been substantial, the decline in oil prices has not.

""There is no question the fall in U.S. oil production has hurt the global market, but it has not made it worse,"" said Michael Froman, senior vice president of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based think tank. ""We are not seeing a sharp fall in the price of oil.""

The drop in production from the U.S. shale industry has been a blow to the U.S. shale industry, which has been growing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad.

U.S. shale production has dropped from an average of 10 million bpd a year to 8",fake

"A top official at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has compared the coronavirus outbreak to the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have both said that the death toll from the Ebola outbreak is much higher than the death toll from the H1N1 flu pandemic that hit the United States in 2009.

At least 19 people have died from Ebola in West Africa so far, according to the CDC.

Dr Richard Bradbury, an infectious disease expert at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), told the BBC that ""the scale of this is incredible"" and that ""it is like the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States.""

""The scale of this is incredible, especially for a pandemic, because the pandemic of the H1N1 flu was so huge that we were never really able to get the virus in the United States and it was a huge problem,"" he added.

He added that the deaths in the Ebola outbreak are ""much higher than the death toll from the H1N1 flu pandemic.""

The U.S. health care system is also facing a crisis in terms of patient care. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were nearly 26,000 new cases of Ebola in the United States between January and August of this year.

And the number of deaths from the virus is far higher than the death toll from the H1N1 flu pandemic.

Since the epidemic started in West Africa in March, there have been more than 1,800 deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC.

The U.S. health care system is also struggling to deal with the large number of cases of the virus. In fact, according to the CDC, the number of cases of the Ebola virus in the U.S. has increased by more than 60 percent since March, when there were only about 3,500 cases.

This is the second time in less than a month that a person has died from the Ebola virus. On August 5, a Liberian man died after contracting the virus from an infected nurse at an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia, Liberia.

Dr. Richard L. Daley, director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told The New York Times that the problem with the virus is that ""it doesn't spread very well. It is very spreadable.""

Dr. Daley also said that the vaccine is ""not going to make a difference, it will only make the virus more virulent.""

"Oil stocks were the biggest losers on the Footsie today after an an oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia broke out at the weekend, sending crude prices tumble by over 30 per cent.

As a result of the ongoing oil wars, Brent crude prices fell nearly 70 per cent to $60.65 a barrel, the lowest level since January 2010.

The Brent crude price has been in freefall since mid-November, hitting a new low of $45.70 a barrel on Thursday.

Even before the weekend oil war, Brent crude was already in freefall, falling below $40 on Thursday.

The plunge in crude prices has meant that more than $1 trillion in oil reserves have been depleted in the Middle East and North Africa.

Saudi Arabia's decision to cut oil production by 4.3 million barrels per day was a clear signal to the rest of the world that it was not going to be able to maintain its output levels.

Saudi Arabia is currently in a six-month oil price war with Russia, which has led to a huge drop in global oil prices.

Saudi Arabia has been accused of paying too much for its oil, with the country's stock market falling nearly 9 per cent in the past week.

The price of crude has also dropped precipitously, with the price of a barrel of crude trading at around $39.60 on Friday.

The drop in oil prices has led to a huge drop in the price of gold and silver, and has also led to a huge surge in the value of gold and silver.<|endoftext|>BENGALURU: The Indian Railways has launched the Rail Transportation, Transport and Logistics (RTL) App to connect passengers with the trains and stations in their area.The app is available in English, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi and Tamil and is available on the App Store for Android and for Apple devices.The app offers a wide range of services to connect passengers with trains and stations.

"The father of a Missouri woman who tested positive forcoronavirusviolated self-quarantine rules to attend a school dance with his younger daughter on Saturday night, according to a statement released by the university.

The school's director of student health and safety released a statement Thursday saying a student tested positive for the virus. The school said the student has been removed from the dance and the district is conducting an investigation.

The school's statement said the dance was held in conjunction with a university event, and that the dance was conducted under the supervision of a school health care professional. The statement did not say who performed the dance.

""The University of Missouri System is aware of a recent incident involving a student attending a dance at a university campus,"" the statement said. ""The University is taking appropriate measures to ensure that all university events are conducted in a manner that respects the privacy of all students. The University is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for all students and is taking all necessary steps to ensure that the safety of our students and campus community is not compromised.""

The school's statement did not specify what measures it was taking to ensure the safety of the dance.

The statement said the dance was held at a university-owned school facility and that the dance was not part of a university event. The school also did not say if the dance was at a campus event.

University spokesman Jim Thomas said he could not comment on the incident because it was under investigation.

""I would like to assure you that we take the privacy of all students very seriously and we take every precaution to ensure that our student-athletes are always safe,"" Thomas said. ""We have a team of school health care professionals who monitor all student-athletes at all times and monitor events at the university, as well as the community at large. We take all of that seriously. We will continue to monitor the situation and we will continue to monitor the situation. We will look at all of that and we will make changes to our student-athlete program to ensure that we are providing a safe environment for all our students and the community.""

The statement also did not say what type of tests were being done to determine the status of the student, who was not identified in the statement.

The dance was organized by a student-run club called the Missouri Supremacy Crew, which is based on the ""supremacy"" group of the church of the same name, according to its website.

A Facebook page that is associated with the group has more than 3,600 likes.

Thomas said the club has no official affiliation with the school and that the club's goal is to create a safe and inclusive environment for all students.

"Top economic advisors are planning to present economic options to President Donald Trump for how to steady financial markets and short up the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak when he gets back to Washington from a campaign fundraiser in Florida on Friday.

Trump has spent much of his campaign telling Americans how to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, and he has often used the phrase ""America first.""

His economic team is preparing to present a set of economic options to the president, including a reduction in the federal deficit, an increase in infrastructure spending and tax reform.

Related: 10 things to know about the virus

In recent weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a spike in cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. and abroad, but officials have been unable to determine the cause.

More than 5,000 people have been infected with the virus in the U.S. and more than 3,000 people have died.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the virus is not spread through contact with bodily fluids such as semen, urine or feces, and it is not spread by direct contact with infected mosquitoes.

It is spread by direct contact with an infected person who has no symptoms.

If the president's economic team presents its options, it could be a form of political theater, as experts have argued that it would be premature for the president to make policy.

Trump has spoken out on the topic of a possible ""hard landing"" in his administration, including the possibility of a ""big tax cut"" to stimulate the economy.

In the past, Trump has said that he is ""not a big fan"" of tax cuts.

If Trump wants to show that he is serious about economic growth and job creation, he will need to show the country that he will pursue the right policies in order to balance the budget.<|endoftext|>As many as 50 percent of the people who were killed in the Paris attacks may have been killed by the police.

"Face reality as it is, not as it was, or as you would wish it to be,' said the late, great business tycoon Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric into one of the world's most successful firms.

The news is that the world's biggest banks have all been outbid by one another for the exclusive rights to buy the Chicago stock market, and that only the most prestigious banks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have been able to secure a license to trade in the city.

The Chicago Tribune reported yesterday that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is seeking re-election in November, is reportedly considering an ""emergency"" bailout of the city.

According to the newspaper, the mayor is looking at a series of options, including selling off some of the city's assets, including the Chicago Tribune building, to raise $15 billion in debt, and to make the city's debt-ridden banks into the 'new normal' lenders of last resort.

Huge amounts of money will be needed to bail out the banks, and the city is projected to have $28 billion in outstanding debt.

It was only a matter of time before the banks and other financial institutions would be able to find a way to merge, and the combined company could easily do so, but the Chicago mayor and his allies believe that they could use the city's debt to finance a public-private bank.

The city has already agreed to buy out $4.5 billion in loans it has taken on from the banks, with the city government paying $8.5 billion and the banks $3.2 billion, according to the Tribune.

The city has already agreed to buy out $4.5 billion in loans it has taken on from the banks, with the city government paying $8.5 billion and the banks $3.2 billion, according to the Tribune.

The deal, if approved, would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $4.8 billion owed to banks and $8.8 billion owed to bondholders, according to the Tribune.

The deal could also mean a new era for Chicago, with the city's pension fund, which has long been underfunded, likely to be able to fund a significant portion of the financial obligations of the city.

The city's bondholders, however, would still have to cover the debt, and those bonds could fall into the hands of investors or bondholders of smaller firms.

"Twitter says it's reached an investment deal with Silver Lake and Elliott Management that will keep Jack Dorsey as CEO.

""We are excited about the future of our company, which is why we have decided to join forces with Silver Lake and Elliott Management,"" said Jack Dorsey. ""We have a great team of talented people and we are excited to continue building an exciting and valuable company. We look forward to working with them to create a strong and sustainable platform for our customers.""

The announcement comes on the heels of a series of changes at Twitter that many have attributed to the departure of Chief Executive Dick Costolo.

Dorsey has been out of the picture since the end of June, but Twitter has reportedly been looking to find a replacement for Costolo, as well as a new CEO for its global operations. The company has reportedly hired former Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to replace Costolo as CEO.

It's not clear how much of a role Dorsey will have in the company's new strategy.

The social network said that its two new executives will join a team of about 25 people and will serve for the next six months.

""In addition to our new team, we have also hired several highly experienced talent to join our team,"" said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a statement. ""We are grateful for the incredible work they have done over the past year and look forward to their continued contributions.""

The news comes a day after Twitter announced it has hired former Google and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer as CEO.

Mayer, who left her role as CEO of LinkedIn to take over Twitter, is the most senior female CEO in the world, and she has been widely criticized for her lack of women's empowerment at the company.

""I'm thrilled that Twitter has selected a woman for our leadership team,"" said Mayer in a statement. ""I'm especially excited about working with the team and having them join Twitter for the long term. I'm confident that we can build a great company that will make Twitter a leader in diversity and inclusion.""

She added: ""I'm excited about the opportunity to lead Twitter, and I look forward to working with my team to build the strongest, most powerful company in the world.""

The company's first round of investments came from the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, which announced in February that it was investing $50 million.

The company said that it will be hiring people in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Dorsey's departure comes as Twitter is seeing growing competition from social media giants like Facebook and Instagram.

The company announced this week that it is expanding its presence on mobile, adding support for mobile devices and making its own app for iPhone and Android.<|endoftext|>Story highlights",fake

Liberal commentator Catherine Herridge has warned British citizens that they must 'pay attention' to the Trump administration and take a stand against its policies.

"Remarkable no-holds barred notes by JFK have revealed his sexual preferences and his fears about being outed as an adulterer in 1960's America.

He had not been married for more than three years and had no children.

""This is a picture of a man who was so comfortable in his own skin that he would sometimes kiss his wife, but he had no intention of doing so,"" said Prof Robert C. Bancroft, author of The Last Days of Jackie Kennedy, the first in-depth biography of the president.

The writing on the wall: JFK's will revealed

The book reveals that the president, who was known as a ""gentle giant"" and a ""gentle giant at heart,"" was also a ""gentle giant"" with a fear of being outed.

""He was deeply conflicted about his sexual life,"" Prof Bancroft told the BBC.

""He was worried about the possibility that he would be accused of having affairs with men who were in his position.

""He knew that if he were to be caught, he would be outed as having affairs with people who were in his position.

""And he was aware that if he were to be outed as having affairs with people in his position, he would be accused of having affairs with his own wife.""

Prof Bancroft also reveals that the president had no intention of retiring from politics in the 1960s, even though he had become a millionaire.

""He was a very active and successful politician who had a reputation for being very, very wealthy,"" Prof Bancroft said.

""But he was not going to retire from politics.

""He had a very strong sense of the importance of his family and of his children. He would never have given up his children.

""He would not have let them go, but he would have given them up.""

"Six prisoners have died after a series of jailhouse riots in Italy which were sparked by tough new measures to stop the spread of coronavirus.

The country's prisons and detention centres are to be closed until further notice, the Interior Ministry said, after the deaths of at least eight inmates.

The rioting was caused by a ""desperate attempt"" by the authorities to control the spread of coronavirus, it said.

It is the latest in a series of outbreaks in Italy since the country relaxed its strict anti-coital hygiene laws in 2006.

The new laws have been hailed as a major step towards preventing the spread of deadly diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.

The new measures were introduced in response to the spread of a coronavirus that causes avian flu, which has killed more than 300 people in Italy since it was first detected in 2009.

The new rules are not expected to have an impact on the deaths of the inmates who died in the riots.

The minister for public health and hygiene, Mr Federico Lombardi, said the new measures had not gone far enough.

""This is not a solution to the problem of avian flu in prisons,"" he told a news conference.

""The situation is not good. There is an increase in the number of infections in the prisons, it is not good.

""We are talking about a small fraction of the population of prisoners in prisons. It is a small fraction.""

Mr Lombardi said there were still people who were dying of the virus, but that the number of deaths would increase as the measures were implemented.

He said that, as a result of the new measures, a total of 42 prisoners had died from the virus in the past three months.

The minister also said that the prison system had become a ""very dangerous place"".

He said that the rioting had been sparked by a ""desperate attempt"" by the authorities to control the spread of coronavirus.

The minister also said that there were 10 prisoners who had died in the riots on September 17.

"A schoolboy who hugged Meghan Markle after she hosted an event at his school in east London, today said his mother is his real hero for taking care of him and his three brothers in the wake of the Manchester Arena atrocity.

Abdul Malik, 16, said his mother, Sharmeen Obaid, 35, was the ""hero"" after she called an ambulance after a blast tore through the crowd at the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena, killing 22 people.

""She was the only one who was able to save my brothers and I,"" he said. ""She saved my life. I am so proud of her.""

Abdul Malik said his mother called the ambulance after the blast.

Sharmeen Obaid, 35, from Harrow, west London, had been called to the scene by a security guard who spotted her in a group of girls, and alerted police.

She was at the concert with her partner and another girl who were also hurt.

Abdul Malik said his mother had called him by phone just after 1am, telling him she was going to the concert.

""She was talking to her partner on the phone and she said she was going to the concert, so I called her,"" he said.

""I was a little bit nervous because I didn't know what to do, so I told her to get her partner and they were going to the concert.""

Sharmeen Obaid and her partner were in the area when the explosion happened.

The mother-of-two said her son was very emotional when she called.

""She was crying and he was crying. He was telling me to be careful and I told him to be careful because it was a big explosion,"" he said.

Sharmeen Obaid was among the injured when the blast ripped through the crowd.

The attack was the worst to hit Manchester since the suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena in May.

Abdul Malik said his mother is the one who has always been the ""hero"" for him.

""She is the one who is always there to protect me,"" he said. ""She is the one who is always with me and she is the one who is always there.""

He said she is now ""unbelievably happy"" and that she is now in the hospital.

"Hope Hicks has packed up her life in Los Angeles to return to the political circuit in Washington D.C. — with the help of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.

""I've done what I've been asked to do and I'm returning to the D.C. area,"" Hicks said in an exclusive interview with Yahoo News. ""I'm going to do some interviews for the RNC and I'm going to give some speeches.""

Hicks, who serves as the chair of the Republican National Committee, is no stranger to Washington.

She served as an RNC spokeswoman for two years, which included a stint as press secretary for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

She also worked for former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine in his unsuccessful 2008 run for the Republican nomination for president.

Hicks says that she won't be attending the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer. Instead, she's returning to Washington D.C. to lead the RNC.

Hicks' departure from the RNC comes at a time when the party is trying to find a voice for conservative voters.

The party has been trying to figure out how to unite its diverse base of voters, while also trying to counter the influence of President Obama and the Democratic Party.

Hicks says that the party is in a difficult position.

""We are not able to compete on the national level anymore with the Democrats because they have so many more people who are on the fence about whether they are going to vote for us or not,"" Hicks said.

She says that the party has a lot of work to do to become more of a political party.

""The Republicans have to develop a brand that they are serious about,"" Hicks said. ""We have to broaden our message, build a solid fundraising base, build a big infrastructure, build a big organization and build a new infrastructure in the state of Iowa.""

Hicks says that the party must find a way to win back the White House.

""I think that's our biggest challenge, is that we have been losing ground in the polls,"" Hicks said. ""We have been losing ground in the polls because we haven't been able to come up with a compelling message that is compelling enough to get people to vote for us.""

Hicks also said that she is ""very hopeful"" about the future of the party.

""I'm very hopeful that there are more people in the party who are not committed to the status quo, who are not looking to be part of a two-party system,"" Hicks said.

"People close to Joe Biden have begun discussing how to fill a potential cabinet – with big names from Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg on the list, alongside some prominent bankers and business executives.

And while some Democrats are reluctant to take on the president, Biden's close ties to Wall Street could provide the perfect opportunity to use his role as vice president to highlight the concerns of the financial industry.

Story Continued Below

""Joe Biden's always been a leader on issues like this, and I'm sure he's going to be an excellent partner for the administration,"" said New York Senator Chuck Schumer, who is close to the vice president and who is known to be supportive of Biden.

Biden's advisers are already trying to figure out how to use his role as vice president.

Biden's advisers have begun discussing how to fill a potential cabinet – with big names from Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg on the list, alongside some prominent bankers and business executives.

Among those in the mix are a former Obama administration official, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who will be a key figure in a transition team that will include current and former officials from the Obama administration.

There is also talk of a former top Democratic strategist for President Barack Obama, Bill Burton, as a potential White House chief of staff.

The potential cabinet would include major players in the financial sector, including Warren, Bloomberg and Summers, who have been outspoken on Wall Street. Biden would be a major voice for the financial industry and a potential bridge to the president on issues such as financial regulation.

""There's a lot of people who are in this room who have a lot of experience,"" said a Biden adviser. ""The question is whether they are going to have the experience to be able to bridge that gap.""

A senior Democratic source said Biden would not be a ""bipartisan"" choice for the cabinet. The source said Biden's close ties to Wall Street could provide the perfect opportunity to highlight the concerns of the financial industry.

""There are a lot of people who are in this room who have a lot of experience,"" the source said. ""The question is whether they are going to have the experience to be able to bridge that gap.""

Biden has been one of the president's closest aides and one of his most prominent surrogates, especially on social issues. Biden has been particularly outspoken on the need for the president to push for greater regulation of financial services, particularly as the nation moves toward a new era of increased regulation of Wall Street.

The Biden adviser said Biden's campaign will focus on a series of issues including his ideas on ""how to bring people together and how to get them to vote for something,"" rather than taking a position on specific policies.

"Joe Biden has soared to lead over Bernie Sanders in new polls heading into the next round of Democratic primaries and won the endorsement of former rival Cory Booker on Monday.

The former Maryland governor and US senator is the second-highest-ranking Democrat to endorse Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary.

The endorsement comes as Mr Biden's record on civil rights has been under fire for years. He has previously been critical of the civil rights movement and has backed the Justice Department's decision to prosecute an Alabama preacher who ran a campaign for the white supremacist group Aryan Nations.

The White House said Mr Biden had also given his endorsement to the party's presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.

The endorsement of Mr Biden is the latest in a string of endorsements from Democrats.

In June, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley backed Mr Sanders after he won the endorsement of the National Nurses United union.

In December, former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee, the only candidate to win a majority of delegates in the Democratic primary, endorsed Mr Sanders.

Mr Chafee said he believed ""Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who can make a real difference"".

Mr Chafee said Mr Sanders was the only candidate who ""believes in the American dream"" and who ""stands up for working families"".

The endorsement comes as Mr Sanders' campaign is focusing on an aggressive fundraising push.

In February, he announced that he was raising $15m (£8.7m) from large donations, including one from the hedge fund billionaire Michael Novogratz.<|endoftext|>I have been doing this for a few months now and I am finally getting a decent score.

"A Chinese passenger has been tackled by a plane's cabin crew after she allegedly coughed at flight attendants on purpose amid coronavirus outbreak fears in the country.

The woman, surnamed Liu, was taken to hospital in Beijing after reportedly coughing up blood in the air conditioning unit at a Beijing airport on Sunday, police said.

The suspect was picked up by police and taken to a hospital in the capital, but the incident has now been classified as a case of foul play, the local police station said in a statement.

""A Chinese woman has been taken to hospital with a cough,"" the statement said.

""She was taken to a hospital and is in stable condition.""

On Saturday, Chinese authorities announced that they had identified three people with Ebola in the country, including a woman who had travelled from Liberia to China.

The health ministry said it was now working with health workers in the region to ""establish the cause of the outbreak and the location of the person who may have been infected"".

China's Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that China had already identified the suspected case of Ebola in Guinea and the country was taking ""necessary steps"" to ensure that all health-care workers are properly equipped and trained to deal with the virus.

The ministry added that it was ""concerned about the spread of the Ebola virus in China and the danger to the health of people"".

On Friday, the World Health Organisation said that there were about 1,000 cases of Ebola in Guinea and that the country's health ministry had alerted the WHO to the outbreak.

""It is with great sadness and deep regret that we have to announce that we are cancelling the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in the USA due to the recent coronavirus outbreak,"" a statement read.

""The event was cancelled due to the recent coronavirus outbreak in California, and the athletes are being closely monitored.""

The virus is transmitted from person to person through contact with infected body fluids and can be spread through contact with infected meat, or by eating contaminated food.

The outbreak began last month when a worker at a family-run bingo hall contracted the virus.

A spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the BNP Paribas Open was cancelled due to ""an outbreak of the coronavirus, a highly contagious disease which has been widely reported throughout the United States"".

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the BNP Paribas Open was cancelled due to ""an outbreak of the coronavirus, a highly contagious disease which has been widely reported throughout the United States"".

The official said that the event would be rescheduled for a future date ""to be determined by the athlete's team"".

The world's biggest tournament is one of the main events of the year, with about 100,000 people expected to attend.

The news comes just days after the US government announced that the country's first Ebola patient is in critical condition in the US.

The disease, which is spread through bodily fluids, is extremely contagious and can be fatal.

It is caused by the Ebola virus, which is spread through contact with blood, secretions or the vomit of an infected person.

This is the second time in two months that the BNP Paribas Open has been cancelled due to the virus outbreak.

The event was cancelled in December due to the outbreak of the virus, which caused the cancellation of the event's first round in May.

The US and its neighbours have all been battling the spread of the virus, with the majority of cases being in West Africa.

The US has been hit by several cases of Ebola, including two in Texas and one in the US.

The virus, which was first identified in 1976, is now thought to have spread to four countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

It is thought that the outbreak has spread to a total of 23 countries.

"Panic surrounding the spread of coronavirus is turning us into a 'selfish society', a psychologist has explained.

Professor Stephen Meyer of the University of Cambridge said it was 'exactly the same problem as we had before'.

'You have people who are concerned about the spread of Ebola, and they're being selfish. They're worrying about their own personal health, and they're not going to take any action to stop this outbreak,' he said.

'They're thinking, ""I can't save you, I can't save my own family. I can't save my own family, I can't save my own family.""'

But the contagion is spreading. It has killed 1,073 people, according to the World Health Organisation.

'We're seeing the same kind of social-psychological problems that we had before,' Professor Meyer said.

'The people who are suffering are people who are not being treated well, people who are having terrible experiences with their own families and their own communities.'

The virus is causing problems with the immune system, causing individuals to have weakened immune systems and can trigger severe neurological conditions.

Professor Meyer said the symptoms of the virus are similar to that of a serious respiratory illness.

'It's like the flu, you get this feeling that you have a cold, and then it gets worse,' he said.

'There are a few people who have had this, but they're not dying.

'You don't want to hear that the virus is killing people, because then people are going to start worrying about this.

'But it's a very rare thing, and you have to be very careful about it.'

The outbreak of Ebola is believed to have started in Guinea in December 2014.

It was first diagnosed in Liberia in March and spread to Sierra Leone and Guinea. It is believed to be the worst outbreak in history.

The virus is believed to be transmitted by contact with an infected person who has diarrhoea, vomiting or fever.

It can be fatal if not treated.

The World Health Organisation has warned that more than 70 per cent of the cases have been in Liberia.

There are two main ways of spreading the virus: through contact with bodily fluids and through direct contact with an infected person.

When the virus is transmitted through direct contact, it is known as Ebola virus disease (EVD).

It is spread through direct contact with an infected person who has diarrhoea, vomiting or fever, and who has been in contact with blood, vomit, blood-contaminated water or body fluids from an infected person.

The Health Ministry said the patient who died was a 33-year-old woman from Hefei.

The health ministry said the patient had been quarantined in the building for at least four months and had been subjected to medical treatment.

It added that the hospital had been working on a plan to ensure the safety of its patients.

The hospital's director told Xinhua that the hotel had been under observation for several days.

""The building has a maximum capacity of 200 patients and is in a residential area, so it was not possible to operate the operation in that area,"" he said.

""We were not able to operate the operation in the hospital's other buildings, so we decided to take the precautionary measures to avoid an incident there,"" he said.

The authorities have been scrambling to find out what happened.

The Health Ministry said it had received reports of an explosion and the building had been completely collapsed, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility.

'The story of the future of women in this country is one of overwhelming optimism and determination. We are finding ways to lift women's lives,' she wrote.

'We are also struggling with the reality that our children are not yet ready for their futures. Our country is fighting to protect the rights of those who are not worthy.'

A day after Loughlin's mother, Nancy, and her husband, James, were found guilty of selling the law school, and charged with soliciting bribes for their son's admission, the Obama administration announced it would extend a $10 million loan guarantee to the school.

And the president praised Loughlin and her family's efforts to help her prepare for college.

'She has been a tireless advocate for women's rights and civil rights, and for the greater good of the United States,' he said.

Carbs are great for you!

As far as I know, there is no evidence that low-carb diets have a negative effect on blood sugar levels.

How to start:

The first thing to do is to eat a healthy diet and avoid carbs like potatoes, grains, and sugar. Make sure you're eating a balanced diet with lots of fiber, fat, and protein.

"Tom Brady is launching a Hollywood production company as his future with the New England Patriots and NFL career in general remains uncertain.

The Patriots have not confirmed whether Brady will return to the team. The team has yet to announce whether it will retain Brady's services.

He has not taken a salary cut with the Patriots and has been hired by Fox to develop new talent.

Brady has already made $9.5 million this season, including $5.5 million in incentives, according to the NFL Players Association.

Fox Sports announced Friday that Brady will also develop NFL talent for its NFL Network.

Brady, 35, is scheduled to make $7.5 million this season, according to the NFLPA.

A source close to the Patriots said the team plans to make the first move for Brady as it prepares to move on from the quarterback, who was suspended three games by the NFL on Sept. 5 for his role in Deflategate.

The league also said in a statement that it will not comment on specific contract negotiations.

The Patriots are expected to announce Brady's return as soon as Monday.

The team has not released a statement on the development.

The Patriots have not had a quarterback in the NFL since Tom Brady's suspension in November of 2013, when they had to move on from Matt Cassel and Drew Bledsoe.

The Patriots were ranked No. 3 in the NFL in 2015, but fell to No. 7 in 2016. The team had won 11 of its last 14 games and lost just one game this season.

The NFL fined Brady $54,000 and released him on Sept. 10.

Brady has had three separate concussions in his career, including a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 8 of the 2015 season. He missed the final six games of the 2015 season after suffering a concussion in the fourth quarter of a game against the Detroit Lions.

Brady was one of the NFL's best quarterbacks in 2014. He was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player, and the NFL's MVP, in the regular season.

In his first season as the Patriots' starting quarterback, Brady threw for 2,116 yards and 25 touchdowns, including a season-high 134 yards and two touchdowns against the Indianapolis Colts.

The Patriots finished 15-2 and won the AFC East with Brady at the helm.

"Vaping giant Juul Labs tried to court state attorneys general and donated tens of thousands of dollars to their election campaigns in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to head off legal challenges as e-cigarette usage among teens surged.

Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed suit against the company on behalf of a group of teenagers who said they were exposed to tobacco-related carcinogens when they used the devices.

The suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, alleges that Juul failed to warn its customers that vaping could cause cancer and that it failed to disclose that it offered a discount to those who used e-cigarettes.

Juul has been in litigation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for years, and its products are sold in 20 states.

The lawsuit accuses Juul of violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by advertising its products as an ""electronic cigarette,"" which is a class of products that includes electronic cigarettes, but does not include e-cigarettes.

""We're thrilled with the outcome of this lawsuit,"" said Aron Jaffe, senior staff attorney for the ACLU's Project on Electronic Cigarettes. ""The government has a strong interest in ensuring that these products are safe and that people who use them can use them safely, and we're pleased that the court sided with our clients.""

The suit is the latest in a series of attempts by the FDA to take a hard line on the use of e-cigarettes among teens.

In July, the FDA issued a notice to companies warning them that e-cigarettes could pose a ""public health threat"" if they were marketed to children.

On Tuesday, the agency released a statement saying it would continue to look for ways to regulate e-cigarettes.

""The agency remains committed to finding a way to reduce the harms associated with the use of e-cigarettes and other vapor products, including to help keep e-cigarette use among youth from increasing,"" the statement said.

The FDA also said that it has recently stepped up enforcement of existing laws on tobacco products and tobacco use.

On Monday, the agency said it would propose legislation in the coming months that would require the labeling of tobacco products and e-cigarettes, which will also require the labeling of tobacco products and e-cigarettes.

The FDA said it will also review e-cigarette regulations for small tobacco retailers.

The agency also said it will ""take appropriate enforcement actions"" against e-cigarette companies that have failed to comply with the new rules.<|endoftext|>Cafe de le déplacement

"Ronaldinho's lawyer has said the Brazilian football star was 'stupid' rather than guilty as his client posed for a picture in a Paraguayan prison following his arrest for using a fake passport.

The player, who is set to return to Manchester United next month, was arrested in the city of La Paz on May 23 and charged with using a fake passport and conspiracy to commit a crime.

But his lawyer, Fernando Mendes, has told Daily Mail Online he has no evidence that the 27-year-old used the fake passport to enter Paraguay.

He told Daily Mail Online: 'I don't have any evidence of this. He did it because he was stupid and he did it in a place that was not a safe place for him to go.

'I don't know what happened in his mind. I don't know if he knew he was doing it or if he was just joking with his friends.

'But he did it because he didn't have any other choice. He had nothing to do with it and he did it because he wanted to go home.

'He wanted to go home. He wanted to go to a place where he felt safe. He was stupid and he did it in a place that wasn't safe for him.'

Mendez said the footballer has been cleared of the charges and is due to appear in court again in August.

In a statement to MailOnline, the Paraguayan prosecutor's office said: 'In the following months, the prosecutor will seek the investigation of the defendant's case.

'The investigation will focus on the alleged use of a fake passport by the defendant during his visit to the capital city of La Paz.

'The prosecutor will also request that the defendant's passport be searched in order to determine the identity of the person who used the fake passport.

'The investigation will also examine the possibility that the defendant has other aliases or ties to criminal organizations, which is another possible explanation for the defendant's actions.'

"Two U.S. District Court judges in the Northern District of California ruled that the city had violated the Fourth Amendment when it held that a police officer could search a vehicle and seize drugs without a warrant.

The case is the latest case to bring scrutiny to the practice of using roadside surveillance cameras to spy on motorists.

The city's practice of using cameras to monitor drivers has drawn criticism from civil liberties advocates who say it violates the Fourth Amendment and the Second Amendment, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The city argued that the cameras were necessary to protect officers from a possible threat from a suspect driving a stolen car.

""The cameras are an invaluable tool in the police department's efforts to safeguard public safety,"" said Detective-in-Charge Michael Estrada in a written statement. ""I wish the Court would consider the Second Amendment implications of this practice, which is why I'm writing this opinion.""

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, while the Second Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The city's lawyers argued that the cameras were necessary to protect officers from a possible threat from a suspect driving a stolen car.

""The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, while the Second Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures,"" wrote Judge Paul Watanabe in a brief filed in a case involving the use of roadside surveillance cameras.

""The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, while the Second Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures,"" wrote Judge Paul Watanabe in a brief filed in a case involving the use of roadside surveillance cameras.

The camera system was installed in November 2011, and the city says it has been effective in tracking suspects driving stolen cars.

But the judge wrote that the city's use of the camera system was illegal because it was being used to spy on drivers.

""The City has adopted a policy of tracking motorists who are suspected of having driven a stolen car, thereby giving the City a means of monitoring the driver's movements and the movements of the suspect,"" Watanabe wrote.

Watanabe's opinion said the city violated the Fourth Amendment and the Second Amendment when it used the camera system to spy on drivers.

""The City's use of the system was unconstitutional,"" Watanabe wrote. ""The Fourth Amendment is a 'right secured by the people by the consent of the governed.' The Second Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.""

"Video loaded onto social media shows federal agents arresting a suspected undocumented immigrant who was doused with pepper spray during a raid in a Brooklyn restaurant.

The man, whose name has not been released, was arrested for criminal possession of a weapon and resisting arrest, according to police.

The incident occurred at the Masai Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), a violent gang that has been linked to a string of deadly gang-related attacks in New York City.

The group has been accused of leading a gang of mostly young men that has been involved in a string of high-profile assaults and robberies in recent years.

The New York Police Department has made about 500 arrests of gang members and members of MS-13 in the past year.

In January, a MS-13 gang member killed a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent and injured another while attacking two New York City officers at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

In 2015, authorities arrested 15 members of the gang in a series of raids on two Staten Island bridges, and in 2013, a New York City man was killed by members of the gang in a gangland-style killing.

The two countries have entered a period of renewed military-technical cooperation, with the two militaries sharing important information and expertise, and the two countries have maintained a mutual deterrence against any attack from the other.

The Chinese have been more active in their support of the US in its offensive operations in the South China Sea. They have helped to increase the number of aircraft and ships participating in joint exercises, including the joint naval drills with Japan in the South China Sea.

China has also taken an active role in the military assistance program for the US, providing a considerable sum of money to the US military to purchase equipment, training and other military equipment.

On the economic front, China has provided many of the financing for the US infrastructure in the US and has been a significant investor in the US-China trade.

There are also numerous economic and trade issues between the two countries. For example, China has become a major supporter of the BRICS, a group of emerging economies that include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Nigeria, and South Africa. The BRICS members also have their own currency. China also has significant trade interests with Latin America and Africa.

In order to balance their relations, the two countries have also been working closely on the international cooperation agenda.

The strategic partnership between China and the US is one of the most important and enduring bilateral cooperation initiatives between the two countries. This partnership has helped to ensure stability and stability of the world order.

The new name, which was revealed by the American biologist John Winthrop, will be the first of its kind, according to the GPAA.

""Juan de la Cruz was a great explorer and a great man,"" said Phil Paul, president of the group. ""His discovery of the Komodo Forest was one of the great environmental catastrophes of our time, and our long-term commitment to preserving the GPAA's global Komodo Project is a testament to his legacy.""

Juan de la Cruz was born in 1753, but died in 1845, the last living member of the species, the GPAA said.

A cultural touchstone, the forest has been home to a diverse assortment of animals since its discovery in 1843. Today, more than 2,000 species of primates live in the forest, including more than 700 species of the human family.

In addition to the Komodo, the remaining two members of the genus, the genus Monoceros and the species Primateia, are also living in the forest, the GPAA said.

The Katuwara women of Kebale are one of the most powerful tribes in the world. They have always been feared and respected by the tribesmen, and these days, the Katuwara women of Kebale are the most feared women in Kenya.

The investigation, carried out by Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), focuses on horses bred for racing in Europe, including the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Austria and the Netherlands.

The alleged ring was led by a man called ""Max"" who sent horses to races in Austria and Italy, authorities said.

""This is an international organised crime enterprise that uses horses as a means of making money,"" said Andrew Hatton, head of the SOCA, in a statement.

Max, who authorities said has been arrested in France, has been charged with conspiracy to supply horses for racing purposes and trafficking in drugs.

He was arrested in the southern French town of Toulouse and later released on bail pending extradition to Britain.

Max was arrested in the U.K. last month, and was released on bail pending extradition to France, the SOCA said.

The investigation has been led by the British police, which arrested the trainers and their agents in April, according to the agency.

Victoria White's fundraising efforts were all for naught when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma on April 15.

The mum-of-two had spent the last few days raising money for patients in her county, in the hope of raising $150,000 for the charity, called People's Aid, which supports sick and elderly people.

But when Victoria was discharged from hospital on April 18, she thought her first ever pimple had turned into a blood cancer.

Her mother, Sharon, told The Sun Online: 'We thought it was a blood cancer. It turned out to be a rare form of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

'The tumour was so small it looked like a spot on her upper lip. We thought it would be a few weeks until it went away but it didn't.

'I thought it was a small white spot but it grew over the next few weeks and I thought it might be a tumour.

'I was desperate to know how it had grown and how it was going to go away.

'I called People's Aid and they told me it was a rare form of Hodgkin's lymphoma. They said it had never before been seen in this area of England.

'When we saw the pictures of the tiny tumour, we were absolutely overwhelmed and so we raised more than £15,000 for the charity.'

'She is so young and is in such a vulnerable situation. She is extremely brave.

'She has been in hospital for five months with the cancer and she's so excited to have been diagnosed. It's been a great experience for her and she's being treated very well.

"Contact lenses capable of allowing a colourblind person to tell red from green without a bulky pair of sunglasses are being developed by a team of scientists led by Dr Daniel T. Shafer, Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Director of the National Institute of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

Dr Shafer has been leading the development of a new type of colour-blind vision-impaired lens that can be fitted on the face and eye of a person with a normal vision.

In a recent article published in the Journal of Vision, Dr Shafer and colleagues reported that the new lenses could be used by people with normal colour vision to see the colour red without the need for glasses.

The research team has also been able to develop a new type of lens that could be fitted on the face and eye of people with normal colour vision to see the colour green without the need for glasses.

Dr Shafer said: ""This is an exciting development in the development of a type of colour-blind lens that could be fitted onto the face and eye of a person with normal colour vision. This new lens will allow for a more accurate and accurate reading of red-green colour, but it also has the potential to provide a more accurate reading of blue-green colour.

""This is important because people with colour vision problems have a range of different forms of colour vision and are at higher risk of developing these problems.

""We believe that this lens can be fitted on the face and eye of a person with a normal colour vision and allows for a more accurate and accurate reading of red-green colour, but also of blue-green colour.

""The new lenses are very sensitive and can distinguish between red and green without the need for glasses. They are also very sensitive to blue, which is useful for people with colour vision problems. We believe that the new lenses will be useful for people with colour vision problems with a range of different forms of colour vision.""

The development of a colour-blind lens is an important step towards the development of the world's first colour-blind vision-impaired glasses that are available to the public.

Dr Shafer said: ""For people with colour vision problems, these lenses will be very useful in giving them a more accurate and accurate reading of red-green colour, but also of blue-green colour.
