0,"Billionaire Bill Ackman says 'America will end as we know it' unless Trump shuts entire country down NOW for 30 days - rather than 'a gradual roll-out that is scaring people and bankrupting the economy, starting with hotels and restaurants'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127169/Billionaire-Bill-Ackman-says-hotel-firm-world-coronavirus-crisis-continues.html,"Billionaire Bill Ackman has warned that 'America will end as we know it' unless President Trump immediately shuts down the entire country for 30 days. Hedge fund manager Ackmanmade the dismal predictions in a Twitter post Wednesday and in an interview with CNBC, in which he urged President Trumpand other global leaders to 'shut the world for 30 days'. He said urgent action is needed now if the economy is to survive and if lives are to be spared amid the rapidly escalating coronavirus pandemic. The 'gradual roll-out' of closures and measures being taken now are not enough to stop the crisis which is already bankrupting the economy, starting with hotels and restaurants, he said. Ackman made the somber prediction that'hell is coming' and warned that the US as we now know it is ending. 'America will end as we know it. I'm sorry to say so, unless we take this option,' he saidin an interview with CNBC Tuesday afternoon.  'Hell is coming,' he warned. The 'only answer for the world is to shut the world for 30 days,' he told CNBC. 'We have an invisible, silent, deadly enemy. Howdo we kill it? Everyone just goes home.' The stark warning followed his desperate bid to President Trump earlier on Wednesday to shut the US down with an extended Spring Break holiday, saying it is the 'only answer' to spare the nation from economic catastrophe. 'Mr. President, the only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders. Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family. Keep only essential services open. The government pays wages until we reopen,' Ackman said in a Twitter post Wednesday morning. 'No one defaults, no one forecloses. A 30-day rent, interest and tax holiday for all. The shutdown is inevitable as it is already happening, but not in a controlled fashion which is extending the economic pain and amplifying the spread of the virus.' The CEO of Pershing Square Capital warned that each day the US stays open the economy will take a hit and many lives are thrown into jeopardy. 'With exponential compounding, every day we postpone the shutdown costs thousands, and soon hundreds of thousands, and then millions of lives, and destroys the economy,' he tweeted. 'Please send everyone home now. With your leadership, we can end this now. The rest of the world will follow your lead. A global Spring Break will save us all.' However, experts have warned that even a temporary shutdown will not go far enough to stopping the spread of the virus. Researchers at Imperial College London say that social distancing of the entire US population, isolation of anyone infected with coronavirus and quarantines for their household members may be the only way to stem the pandemic - and that these measures may need to be in place for as long as 18 months. The study,published Monday, also warns that if the population doesn't go into isolation, 1.1 million and 1.2 million Americans will likely die of coronavirus. Ackman also spoke of the toll the pandemic is taking on the economy, in particular citing that the hospitality industry will not recover if the response to the virus continues on its current trajectory. 'The hotel industry and the restaurant industry will go bankrupt first, Boeing is on the brink, Boeing will not survive without a government bailout,' Ackman told CNBC. 'Capitalism does not work in an 18-month shutdown, capitalism can work in a 30-day shutdown.' He added:'Take a look at Hilton stock â€“ Hilton is the canary in the coal mine,' he said. Shares in Hilton Hotels were 'down from 120 to 50 and it's going to zero along with every other hotel company', he warned. 'Every hotel is going to shut down... if we allow this to continue every hotel company in the world is done because no business can survive a period of 18 months without revenue and that's what happens if you operate the way we're operating now.' His comments came as major hotel chains including Hilton and Marriott are closing in their masses for the first time in history and the bright lights ofLas Vegas went out after some of Nevada's mammoth casino-hotels shuttered. Major hotel chains have already been hard hit by the outbreak, with unprecedented mass closures spiraling across the US. The world's largest hotel group Marriott announced Tuesday that it has begun furloughing tens of thousands of its employees as its hotels are forced to close their doors. A spokesperson said it had started shutting several of its managed properties and furloughing staff last week. These employees won't be paid during this time but the group hopes to bring them back to the company once the pandemic is over, they said. Meanwhile, in Las Vegas all hotel casinos were forced to close by midnight on Tuesday under a Nevada executive order to close all nonessential businesses. The mandate saw the huge resorts along the Vegas strip - including Bellagio, MGM Grand and The Mirage - shutter until further notice. President Trump held an emergency meeting with a number of large hotel chains Tuesday following pleas for the government to step in and support ailing firms with a federal relief package. Hilton Worldwide chief executive Christopher Nassetta told Trump at the meeting that it is closing hotels in most major US cities for the first time in its history. 'Hilton's been around 100 years â€” we've never closed a hotel that wasn't going to be demolished or rebuilding,' Nassetta said, according to Bloomberg. Experts are warning that the toll on the industry has already dwarfed the impact of 9/11 and the recession. Sean Hennessey, president of consultancy Lodging Advisors and a New York University professor of hospitality told the NY Post that New York hotels had fallen to occupancy levels far below that seen after 9/11. Occupancy rates post-9/11 dropped to a low of 74 percent, and to 79 percent after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, Hennessey said. Today, some hotels are running at five percent. The survival of many Americans depends on the hotel industry, with the American Hotel & Lodging Association predicting thatfour million jobs will be lost in the next few weeks alone."
1,'Millennials cannot keep having these large gatherings for people who are off work': Trump administration warns of 'very concerning' rise in children and young people from coronavirus in ItalyÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8127631/White-House-warns-rise-young-coronavirus-victims-abroad.html,"Children and young adults may not be as safe from coronavirus as previously thought, the Trump administration said on Wednesday. 'We have not seen any significant mortality in children but we are concerned about the reports coming out of Italy and France,' said coronavirus task force member Dr Deborah Birx during a press briefing. She didn't give specific numbers of children infected, nor does a JAMA report on Italian cases document any among people there under age 29. But more cases among children in China have come to light, suggesting kids broadly may be equally vulnerable to adults, and that those under age five may be at risk of falling seriously ill. Dr Birx also urged millennials to take their health and safety seriously amid the coronavirus, citing a rise in severe cases of coronavirus among young adults in China, Italy and South Korea. 'They don't realize that - they're feeling invincible,' said President Trump of young people. 'But they don't realize that they could be carrying lots of bad things home to their grandmother and grandfather and even their parents. 'So, we want them to heed the advice ... and I do believe it's getting through.' Dr Birx echoed his concerns and elaborated with references outbreaks in other countries. 'There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about young people getting very seriously ill and getting very seriously ill in the ICU,' Dr Birx said. 'We think that part of it may be that people heeded the very early data coming out of...China and out of South Korea that elderly or people with pre-existing conditions are particularly vulnerable.' Those reports may have seeded a false sense of security among younger people, she suggested. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  And emerging data is now indicating young adults are far from safe from coronavirus. 'It may [be] that the millennial generation...there may be disproportionate infections among that group, so that even if they are a rare occurrence, they may be seen more frequently in that group and be more evident now,' said Dr Birx. She also underscored that young people are the ones still going out to large gatherings - both abroad in hard-hit countries like Italy and in the US - meaning they are exposing themselves to more possible coronavirus carriers and prospectively bringing the disease home with them. The Trump administration's 15-day guidelines to stop coronavirus's spread urge all Americans - including millennials - to stop gathering in groups of more than 10, in the hopes of keeping all generations safer from the virus. Official data from Italy does not reflect an increase in cases among younger people - yet - but anecdotal reports do. 'The type of patient is changing,' Dr Luca Lorini, head of anesthesiology and intensive care at a hospital in Northern Italy told RaiNews24. 'They are a bit younger, between 40 and 45 years old and the cases are more complicated.' According to Statista.com, nearly a quarter of cases in Italy are among people between ages 19 and 50, and 1.1 percent of those sickened are younger than 19, although a JAMA report released Wednesday does not reflect that. In the US, data on he ages of those infected is sparse. But last week, when just 49 US deaths were confirmed (that number has now risen to 121), only one of the deceased was in their 40s, two were in their 50s and none were reported by ABC News among younger groups. However the most recent data coming out of China suggests worrisome trends among children who were previously thought to be fairly resilient agains the virus. A study published Tuesday in Pediatrics examined data on more than 2,000 coronavirus-stricken children there (a case load reported as of February 8). Nearly 40 percent of those became moderately ill, while about half only had mild symptoms. But at least one of the 125 children who became severely sick died. And the severely ill children accounted for six percent of all pediatric illnesses in China. It's a trend officials are now watching closely for in the US. ALABAMA Alabama health officials on Tuesday ordered the closure of day cares, senior centers and on-site restaurant dining in six counties to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

2,US academics argue that a shutdown of just five weeks NOT 18 months could end coronavirus pandemicÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126599/NECSI-academics-challenge-Imperial-College-claim-coronavirus-lockdown-18-months.html,"A new academic paper argues that a lockdown of several weeks could be sufficient to stop the spread of coronavirus, directly challenging Imperial College London's claim that widespread shutdowns may need to continue for 18 months until a vaccine is available. In their study released on Monday, Imperial College issued the stark recommendation, causing the US and UK governments to begin planning for dramatic and long-term shutdowns. However, anacademic paper published on Tuesday by the New England Complex Systems Institute argues that Imperial College's model ignores other key interventions that could be deployed after a lockdown ends. In essence, the authors argue that a lockdown of several weeks could be sufficient to stamp out the virus, as long as travel restrictions, widespread testing capabilites, and contact tracing protocols are in place to limit any subsequent outbreaks. 'When everyone is locked down for two weeks, if someone develops symptoms, the people with them can be isolated. No one else can become infected. So including these cases and a few random ones, it takes four to five weeks to stop the outbreak,'said the paper's co-author Yaneer Bar-Yam in a tweet. 'China and South Korea showed this is actually how it happens,' he continued. According to their assessment, Imperial College experts believe social contact may well need to be minimized throughout the population until a vaccine is widely available - up to 18 months from now. '[W]e predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed' before a vaccine is available, the Imperial College experts write. In their rebuttal, the academics as NECSI, a small think tank based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, disagree. 'Their conclusions that there will be resurgent outbreaks are wrong,' the NECSI authors write. 'After a few weeks of lockdown almost all infectious people are identified and their contacts are isolated prior to symptoms and cannot infect others.' They continue: 'The outbreak can be stopped completely with no resurgence as in China, where new cases were down to one yesterday, after excluding imported international travelers that are quarantined.' Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus was first detected in late December and which has been under lockdown for weeks, reported just one new case for a second straight day Wednesday. The NECSI authors go on to argue that with certain measures in place, such as bans on mass gatherings and travel restrictions, it could be possible to relax a population-wide lockdown without resurgence of the virus. The Imperial College authors did not immediately respond to an inquiry from DailyMail.com, but in their study, they did argue that it is too early to tell whether China has successfully contained the spread of coronavirus. They write: '[W]hile experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.' While the academics disagree about the steps that may be necessary to end the pandemic, none of them argue for taking the situation lightly. Both sides agree that without intervention, the loss of life and human suffering would be enormous, with hospitals becoming overwhelmed by critical patients. The Imperial College study estimated that 2.2 million Americans would die without the imposition of mitigation strategies, such as social distancing. The NECSI authors also urged authorities to 'go all out' with mitigation strategies, but to be prepared to fine-tune them in time rather than trying to statistically model their effects ahead of time. 'Since the exponential decay is highly sensitive to the interventions made by both government and social action, simulating their effects is less helpful than the advice to ""go all out"" and refine the effort over time with improved tracing, testing, and other protocols,' write the NECSI authors."
3,"Famed NYC restaurateur Danny Meyer, behind Gramercy Tavern and Jazz Standard, lays off TWO THOUSAND workers 'due to near-complete elimination of revenue' caused by coronavirus",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127273/NYC-restaurant-giant-Gramercy-Tavern-Jazz-Standard-lays-2-000-workers.html,"Union Square Hospitality Group, the New York City restaurant giant, has laid off 2,000 workers, or 80 percent of the company's workforce. Famed restaurateur Danny Meyer's company put the layoffs into effect on Wednesday morning 'due to a near-complete elimination of revenue,' the company told the New York Times. The company operates18 restaurants in New York City and two in Washington DC. Both cities have banned all restaurants from offering dine-in service due to the coronavirus pandemic. USHG locations include Gramercy Tavern, Jazz Standard, and Blue Smoke. The company is currently selling gift cardsand dedicating all of the proceeds toward an 'employee relief fund.' It is just the latest in a series of severe impacts that the pandemic and containment measures are having on workers. A spate of orders closing all restaurants and bars for dine in service in New York, California, New Jersey, Illinois and many other states has devastated those who work in the industry. Across the country, there were 11,674,000 people working in restaurants and bars as of February, according to federal data. Layoffs have come so quickly that the state unemployment insurance websites crashed in New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Ohio, Washington D.C. and Kentucky, with some states being forced to stagger applicants by last name to break up the large numbers applying. A U.S. restaurant trade group on Wednesday asked the White House and Congressional leaders for a $455 billion aid package, saying that the industry could shed nearly half of its 15.6 million jobs and at least a quarter of its annual sales because of the coronavirus outbreak. The group, the Washington, D.C.-based National Restaurant Association, said restaurants could take a $225 billion sales hit in the next three months, a quarter of their projected total sales of $899 billion. As food service establishments are forced to close or shift operations to delivery, pickup and drive-thru only, the industry could lose as many as 7 million jobs, the group said. The broader economic impact could be a loss of $675 billion, with every dollar spent in a restaurant generating an additional $2 elsewhere in the national economy, the group said in its letter to President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The closures and drastic changes were put in place in an effort to help slow the spread of the respiratory illness that has now infected more than 6,400 nationally and killed more than 100 Americans. The letter came a day after executives from some of the world's biggest fast food chains, including McDonald's Corp , Restaurant Brands International Inc and Yum! Brands Inc met with Trump and other officials. The association's request includes creation of a $145 billion Restaurant and Foodservice Industry Recovery Fund to provide immediate liquidity to operators, $100 billion of federally-backed business interruption insurance and $135 million of disaster unemployment assistance. 'As an industry that is based on welcoming everyone through our doors, we are uniquely affected by mandates that keep us from serving our customers,' the letter said. 'Without aggressive and immediate action from the federal government, many restaurants that are a staple of local communities will simply never resume service.' The letter also asks for $45 billion of loans, $35 billion for federal community block grants for disaster help and tax relief. "
4,From bread to milk: How long your food essentials will REALLY last when you're in self isolation - and tips to make the common items last longer,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8124213/How-long-food-essentials-REALLY-tips-make-common-items-longer.html,"As thousands across Australia work from home or self isolate amid the coronavirus pandemic, many will be wondering just how long their food essentials really last. From bread to milk, everything has a different shelf life - and it's important to know how long you can really keep eating and using the foods in your fridge, freezer and pantry before they go bad. Experts also shared their tips to make your common food items last longer, including adding a pinch of salt to your milk to prolong its life by seven days and putting your vegetables into airtight containers. So what do you need to know? PANTRY ESSENTIALS Pantry essentials like dried pasta, herbs and rice are some of the longest-lasting foods in your cupboard. Dried pasta A typical packet of dried pasta will last up to a year, provided it's stored well. The best way to store dried pasta is in glass jars rather than airtight containers. This is because the containers absorb moisture and make the pasta become limp and sticky. The ideal setting for your dried pasta is in a cool dark place, without much access to direct sunlight. Herbs You can expect to get up to one year from your dried basil, coriander and parsley, and you can make your fresh herbs last even longer than usual by freezing them. Finely chop them up and put them in ice cube trays with olive oil or water, before putting them into the freezer. You can also do similar with any sauces, pastes or pesto - meaning you'll always have condiments prepped and ready for if you have to quarantine. Flour For any baking addicts, it's worth bearing in mind that experts from Healthlineadvocate you keep your flour for no longer than eight months. The best way to store flour is in a cool, dark place at room temperature. Olive oil If olive oil is stored in the right way, it will last for one and a half years before you need to throw it away. However, this changes once you open up your oil - and then it needs to be used between 30 and 60 days. Rice Uncooked white ricelasts for four to five years in the pantry, while brown rice only last six to eight months in the pantry. FRIDGE FOODS LEMONS: Lemons can be preserved for up to six months simply by slicing them into four quarters and adding salt and water. The salt draws out their moisture and causes them to soften over time, making preserved lemons. CHEESE: Buttering cheese will make it last longer by preventing it from going mouldy. The protective layer of butter keeps air from oxidizing and delays mould growth. BREAD: Adding a stick of celery to a loaf of bread allows the bread to absorb moisture from the stalk, which is made of 95 percent water. This stops bread going stale and growing mould. TOMATO SAUCE: Make pasta sauce last longer by dividing the mixture into an ice cube tray, freezing it and using each cube as you need it. BANANAS:One of the easiest ways to extend the life of a banana, and everything around it, is to wrap the blackened end in cling wrap, tinfoil or sticky tape. When it comes to the foods you usually keep in the fridge, their shelf life is obviously much shorter. Meat Meat, regardless of whether it's cooked or raw, is known to have a shorter fridge and freezer lifespan than most foods. Poultry, pork sausages and minced beef only have a two day expiry in the fridge, which is significantly less than other food staples including rice and vegetables. You can prolong the life of your meat by carefully wrapping it up and sealing any containers with cling wrap or foil. Milk Milk in cartons will only last between five and seven days once they've been opened. To make milk last up to seven days longer, add a dash of table salt or bicarbonate of soda to the milk, which reduces the bacterial activity which naturally occurs in milk. Eggs When cooked, eggs can last up to seven days in the fridge and longer if kept raw. You can prolong their life by cracking them into muffin trays and then putting them into the freezer. Vegetables Throwing vegetables directly into the fridge leads them to grow soggy and limp in a matter of days. To extend the life of vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, dietitian Susie Burrellrecommends dampening a tea towel with water and wrapping it round your fresh produce. 'It'll give you a lot longer with leafy greens in particular, which can be quite expensive, so it's a cost saving tip too,' she said. You could also keep them in airtight containers to make sure they last longer. Cheese If you're looking to stock up on cheese, it's worth remembering it will last about six weeks if opened and between two and four months if you haven't opened it yet. But some online suggest that if you want it to last longer, you should butter it to stop it from going mouldy. This works as the protective layer of butter will keep air from oxidising and delay mould growth butter is composed of fat. 1 x 5kg bag of rice 2 x 1 kg bag of quinoa 1 x 5kg bag of oats 1 x 1kg bag buckwheat 3 x bags pasta 1 x 5kg bag red or green lentils 1 x 2 kg bag of split peas 1 x 1 kg cannellini beans 7 x garlic bulbs 8 x brown and red onions Assorted herbs and spices according to personal preference 9 x tins tuna 5 x tins sardines 1 x jar anchovies 3 x dozen eggs 7 x tinned tomatoes 1 x bottle apple cider vinegar or balsamic 1 x kg nuts of choice 2 bags x potatoes 2 x pumpkin Source: Supercharged Food FREEZER FOODS Your freezer is your best friend when it comes to self isolation and ensuring you have plenty of food to last you a number of weeks. Butter If you want to make your butter last longer than it would in the fridge, consider freezing it - where it will last for four months. Make sure it's well wrapped in a container and sealed again as soon as it's opened. Bread The freezer is one of the best places to put your bread, as it can last up to six months if stored well. It's worth remembering that flavours will dull somewhat after about a month, so test your bread on a regular basis. Frozen peas Most have a packet of frozen peas hanging around in their freezer. Properly stored, frozen peas will maintain best quality for about 12 months in the freezer, although they will usually remain safe to eat after that * Fatty foods like bacon and sausages - Three months * Butter - Four months * Fatty fish like mackerel, sardines and salmon - Four months * Soups and sauces - Three months * Buttery pastries - Four months * Minced meat - Four months * Stews and pies - Four months * Bread and cakes - Six months * Lamb, chicken, pork, turkey and game - Six months * Frozen fruit - Eight months * White fish - Eight months * Whole chicken or steak - One year Source: Good Food"
5,"Trump says 20% unemployment is 'an absolute, total, worst case scenario' as his Treasury Secretary pledges it will NOT reach 1935 levels and checks for all could be as much as $2,000 each",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125713/Trump-promises-cash-saying-money-coming-unemployment-predicted-hit-20-cent.html,"Donald Trump said Wednesday that he doesn't agree with his Treasury secretary that unemployment rates could reach levels as high as 20 per cent. 'No, well I don't agree with that. No, I don't agree,' he insisted during a White House press briefing on coronavirus Wednesday afternoon. 'That's an absolute, total, worst case scenario,' he continued. 'But no, we don't look at that at all. We're nowhere near it.' In February, the unemployment rate was at 3.5 per cent and the highest in recorded U.S. history was during the Great Depression in the 1930s when rates reached nearly 25 per cent. The president's comments asserting those levels are highly unlikely came after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin floated the number during a meeting with GOP lawmakers on Tuesday. Trump promised in a tweet Wednesday morning that 'money will soon be coming' to relieve those who are unable to work due to the coronavirus crisis. 'For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you,' he vowed in a tweet Wednesday morning. 'The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!' he continued, again calling coronavirus the 'Chinese Virus.' He also promised in another tweet: 'I will totally protect your Medicare & Social Security!' Mnuchin warned Republican senators during the meeting at the Capitol Tuesday that the unemployment rate in American could reach 20 per cent. The head of the Treasury Department made the trek to the Hill Tuesday afternoon where he posed risks the economy could face if a coronavirus economic stimulus package is not passed fast, a person familiar with the closed-door meeting toldReuters. But Mnuchin's office pushed back on this claim. 'During the meeting with Senate Republicans today, Secretary Mnuchin used several mathematical examples for illustrative purposes, but he never implied this would be the case,' Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley said in a statement. Despite the recent record-low unemployment, thousands of Americans are already out of work as nonessential establishments in several states have shut down â€“ including restaurants, bars and clothing retailers. On Tuesday, San Francisco implemented a lockdown where all 7 million people in the Bay area were told to 'shelter in place' at their homes for the next three weeks. The markets have spiraled since the coronavirus outbreak rocked the nation earlier this month â€“ and an administration official claiming unemployment could reach new lows would likely rock investors even more. Unemployment rates have reached record lows under the Trump administration, which the president often touts when boasting of his economic achievements since taking office in 2017. Rates of joblessness hit a peak in October 2009 when the unemployment rate hit 10.2 per cent following the 2008 financial crisis. Some states are already reporting astounding numbers. On Monday, 15,000 people in New Jersey applied for unemployment benefits and in Connecticut, nearly 8,000 applications arrived over the weekend. Unemployment claims in Ohio went from 6,500 last week to 45,000 this week. Rhode Island officials also reported on Tuesday that a week-long rise in claims from the coronavirus outbreak brought their application number from 10 on March 11 to 6,282 on March 16. The Trump administration is proposing a phase three stimulus package â€“ before phase two has even made it through the Senate â€“ that would allocate at least another $850 billion in economic relief. Phase one included more than $8 billion in emergency funding and phase two proposes another $10 billion going toward relieving individuals who have to take off work or are unable to go to their jobs due to contracting coronavirus or quarantining. The nearly $1 trillion stimulus package would include sending cash directly to Americans within two weeks, would monetarily backup airlines and the hospitality industry and would likely include a big chunk of cash going toward Trump's desire payroll tax cut. Trump previewed during a coronavirus press briefing at the White House Tuesday that he wants to send more than $1,000 to Americans suffering economically from the coronavirus outbreak. 'We're going big,' Trump said of his administration's stimulus plans. 'We're looking to send checks to Americans immediately,' Mnuchin explained in the briefing, adding that a payroll tax holiday would get money to Americans â€“ but it would be over the next six to eight months. 'Americans needs cash now and the president wants to give cash now,' Mnuchin continued during Tuesday's briefing. 'And I mean now - in the next two weeks,' he added before leaving the briefing early to attend his meeting with GOP senators. Details of how the administration planned to provide direct cash to Americans was not announced at the press conference â€“ and he did not discuss who would be eligible. The only detail he gave was that it could top $1,000 and that there would be some income cut-offs. 'You don't need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks,' he chuckled. Markets saw their worst week since the 1980s last week, dropping a few thousand points â€“ with just a few moments of reprieve as hopes of a bipartisan economic stimulus package monopolized investors' interest. As of Wednesday morning, the U.S. has more than 6,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 115 people died after contracting the fast-spreading respiratory disease. Trump has begun calling coronavirus the 'Chinese Virus,' because he says he wants to make it clear where it originated. He also previewed that he would be participating in the now-daily coronavirus press briefing on Wednesday. 'I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!' the president tweeted Wednesday morning. Critics claim referring to the disease a 'Chinese virus' creates a stigma and some even claim it is a racist phrase. Trump disagrees, claiming the real stigma is Chinese officials claiming the virus was first brought to Wuhan by members of the U.S. military participating in the World Military Games there in October 2019."
6,Trump says he's a 'wartime President' and call coronavirus an 'unseen enemy' as he touts making tough choices to close down parts of the American economy in order to save lives,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127239/Donald-Trump-says-hes-wartime-president-fighting-unseen-enemy.html,"President Trump said Wednesday that he fashions himself a 'wartime president' as he goes into battle against the 'unseen enemy,' the coronavirus. Trump was asked by Fox News Channel's John Roberts if he considers the country to be on a 'wartime footing' to combat the pandemic. 'I do. I actually do,' the president answered from behind the podium in the White House briefing room. 'I'm looking at it that way.' He also said Wednesday he'd use the powers outlined in the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of medical equipment to treat Americans sickened by the virus. 'There's never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it's not enough,' Trump said. 'If we need to use it, we'll be using it full speed ahead.' Just a day before, Trump said he wasn't ready to put the Defense Production Act - a Korean War-era law - into use. But on Wednesday, the president leaned fully in to the idea that he was leading Americans into battle. 'I want all Americans to understand: we are at war with an invisible enemy, but that enemy is no match for the spirit and resolve of the American people,' Trump tweeted Wednesday afternoon. 'It cannot overcome the dedication of our doctors, nurses, and scientists â€” and it cannot beat the LOVE, PATRIOTISM, and DETERMINATION of our citizens. Strong and United, WE WILL PREVAIL!' Discussing his evolution into being a war president Trump, again,gave himself credit for restricting travel from China, a decision he made in January, telling reporters the situation on the ground now in the United States would have been a lot worse. 'That really saved a lot of lives,' he said. 'I view it as a - in a sense, a wartime president, that's what we've been fighting,' he continued. 'It's a very tough situation here. We have to do things. We have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they've ever been.' 'And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy,' Trump said. With Americans across the nation instructed to practice 'social distancing' and told not to engage in non-essential travel, the hospitality industry - including the airlines, cruise ships, hotels, along with bars and restaurants - are being crushed. 'The American people have been incredible,' the president added. Even before Trump made his 'wartime president' declaration, he's been speaking about the coronavirus as if it was a foil. 'I call it the unseen enemy,' he also said at Wednesday's press briefing. 'It snuck up on us,' he claimed. The president has also used the United States' military might to provide resources to those suffering from the virus. For example, he deployed the the Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, to New York City to provide additional 1,000 additional beds for sick New Yorkers. 'It will be in New York City Harbor. This will be, itâ€™s an extraordinary step obviously, itâ€™s literally a floating hospital which will add capacity, and the president said he would dispatch that immediately,' said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo early Wednesday."
7,"Victims' fury as Epstein's 'procurer' Ghislaine Maxwell stakes legal claim to his $636m estate, saying he promised to pay her legal bills and admitting she had 'special relationship' with the dead pedophileÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127343/Ghislaine-Maxwell-tries-stake-claim-Jeffrey-Epsteins-636m-estate.html,"Jeffrey Epstein's 'madam' Ghislaine Maxwell is trying to get cash from the dead child molester's estate to pay off her legal fees. Maxwell has filed paperwork in the US Virgin Islands for a piece of the disgraced financier's estimated $636 million estate, because, she says, he promised to pay for her lawyers. The 58-year-old British socialite â€” who has been in hiding for months â€”made the claim on Friday, five days before Wednesday's deadline for such a claim, according to the New York Times. Maxwell wants the money to pay for legal expenses for suits from women who say she procured them to give sexual services to Epstein while they were still teenagers. In her suit, Maxwell describes herself as a longtime employee who had 'a legal and special relationship' with Epstein, who was found dead in his cell in New York last August. She says she 'incurred significant legal fees, personal security costs and other expenses due to her work for several of Epstein's businesses between 1999 and 2006. She said she managed Epstein's homes in the Virgin Islands, New York, Paris, Florida and New Mexico. The suit says she also worked for his C.O.U.Q. Foundation. Maxwell also claims that before his death he had told her he would pay all her legal fees in lawsuits where she was named as a defendant. She says she sent Epstein's estate a letter last November demanding indemnification of those costs, saying Epstein had put it in writing that he wanted to pay her costs. She says the estate has so far not honored that commitment. The Times says the lawsuit was filed by the law firm Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, which has an office in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. The lawsuit did not say where Maxwell is now living. Last month a judge allowed a lawsuit against her to be filed by email because her accusers had been unable to track her down. Judge Debra Freeman took the rare step in a federal court in Manhattan. Annie Farmer, 40, has accused the former socialite of trafficking her from Arizona to Epstein's Zorro Ranch south of Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1996, where she claims Maxwell sexually assaulted her. Freeman ordered Maxwell to be served by email and through attorneys representing her in the lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, 36, one of the most prominent accusers of Epstein. Maxwell was said by Farmer's lawyers to be actively participating Giuffre's defamation case in the same court. Farmer's lawyers said they didn't think Maxwell should be able to 'dodge the law'. Judge Freeman said that Farmer had 'attempted to locate and personally serve Maxwell to no avail. 'Her counsel has conducted extensive public records searches and located various addresses for Maxwell,' she said. The judge added that Farmer had 'adequately demonstrated that personal service would be impracticable'. Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, has fallen off the grid since Epstein was found dead in his jail cell aged 66 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide but this has been disputed by his lawyers, who say he may have been murdered. DailyMail.com revealed last August that Maxwell was living with a new boyfriend, tech CEO Scott Borgenson in a $3 million oceanfront mansion in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. She is also reported to have been seen in places as far apart as Brazil and Israel. But only picture of her has appeared online. That claimed she was reading a book at an In-N-Out Burger in southern California. Borgenson was spotted walking Maxwell's dog near his office in Boston. Maxwell, who was described as the 'madam of the house' by a former housekeeper at Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida, strenuously denied any wrongdoing after the former Wall Street whiz's death. Maxwell and Epstein dated for several years. She facilitated Epstein's entry to the rarefied worlds of royalty, politics and celebrity, cementing his friendships with Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Woody Allen among others. She is the youngest child of Robert Maxwell, who fell to his death from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, in 1991. After he died it was discovered he had embezzled nearly half a billion British pounds from his companies' pension funds. She attended the boarding school Marlborough College in Wiltshire, England, a favorite of the British elite, and went on to study at Oxford University. In her twenties, she was a well-known face on London's social scene and founded the Kit Kat Club, an alternative to the old-school-tie network for high-powered women. She worked for her father's newspaper, The European, and as the director of Oxford United soccer club when her father was owner. Vilified in the UK, where Robert Maxwell's victims were angered by the lavish lifestyle his family had enjoyed at their expense, Ghislaine relocated to New York, where she took up residence in a small apartment, and set about re-inventing herself. In the early nineties, she took up with Epstein, a Gatsby-like financial whiz, who reportedly only managed the money of clients who could invest $1 billion. His sole publicly named client was Les Wexner, the former owner of L Brands which includes Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Maxwell operated as part-girlfriend, part-employee, orchestrating Epstein's social life. Epstein supported her and helped her remain in the social position she had grown accustomed to from her upbringing. 'Ghislaine floated in and out of the house with the keys, and even though Jeffrey told me they didn't have a sexual relationship, she'd drop under her breath that she was sleeping in his bed from time to time' one Epstein ex-girlfriend told Vanity Fair. The pair partied with Donald and Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago and threw lavish dinners at Epstein's Upper East Side townhouse, attended by celebrities including Woody Allen, Katie Couric, Chelsea Handler, David Blaine and Google co-founder Sergey Brin. The jet-setting financier also hobnobbed with Trump allies Wilbur Ross, Steve Mnuchin and Rudy Giuliani at a Hamptons film screening in 2010, just two months after his release from prison in Florida. In 2008, Epstein was offered a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution and pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting an underage girl for sex. As part of that deal, federal prosecutors agreed not to charge 'any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.' He served 13 months in county jail in Palm Beach, Florida and registered as a sex offender. During his sentence, he was allowed to work from his office most days. The deal was cut by Alex Acosta, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. He resigned from Trump's cabinet where he was Secretary of Labor in the fallout from the Epstein case. On July 6 last year, FBI investigators broke down the doors of Epstein's $77 million New York home after he was arrested on his private jet at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey following a flight from Paris. A search of Epstein's home turned up hundreds of pictures of nude women, some of them minors, along with cash, diamonds, valuable art and an expired Austrian passport with Epstein's face but someone else's name, claiming Saudi Arabia as place of residence, according Geoffrey Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Maxwell is alleged to be one of the main players in a network of recruiters and enablers who provided Epstein with those underage girls to sexually abuse."
8,Angela Merkel declares coronavirus the 'biggest challenge for Germany since World War II'and calls for 'solidarity' to defeat it,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127335/Angela-Merkel-declares-coronavirus-biggest-challenge-Germany-World-War-II.html,"Angela Merkel today declared coronavirus the 'biggest challenge for Germany since WWII' in a televised address to the nation. The Chancellor urged Germans to heed the stringent confinement measures imposed this week as the number of infections in her country soared over 11,000 today, including 28 deaths. 'The situation is serious. Take it seriously. Not since German reunification, no, not since the Second World War, has our country faced a challenge that depends so much on our collective solidarity,' the veteran leader said in her first-ever direct television appeal to the nation. 'I truly believe we can succeed in this task, if all citizens truly understand their own tasks,' Merkel added. Federal and local governments have shut down schools, many businesses and public spaces in recent days in increasingly desperate attempts to slow the spread of the virus. The country has however stopped short of ordering people to stay home, in contrast with the tougher restrictions introduced in France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. But Germans have continued to go outside to enjoy the spring sunshine and socialise, highlighting the authorities' struggle to hammer home the message that people must avoid social contacts. Merkel, who hails from Germany's former communist East, said she understood how hard it was to give up 'hard-fought rights' like freedom of movement and travel. Such decisions were never taken lightly in a democracy, she said, and could only be temporary. 'But they are necessary right now to save lives.' Her speech echoed that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who in a sombre address on Monday likened the outbreak to war and ordered almost the entire population to stay at home for at least two weeks. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health warned there could be 10 million cases within two to three months if people do not avoid contact. 'Germany has an excellent health system,' Merkel said, thanking doctors and other medical workers 'on the front line for us in this battle'. Nevertheless, 'even our hospitals will be overwhelmed if too many patients are brought in with serious symptoms of the coronavirus in a short time,' the conservative leader added. To ramp up medical capacity, German state and federal governments announced steps Wednesday to double intensive respiratory care and commandeer new spaces for treatment. Germany currently has around 25,000 intensive care beds with respiratory capacity, and Berlin has ordered thousands of new respirators to boost that number. In a separate statement, federal and state officials said spaces like hotels, rehabilitation centres and public halls could be converted into spaces for treating people with milder symptoms. In her speech, Merkel reiterated that Berlin 'will do everything it can to cushion the economic impact and preserve jobs' and discouraged citizens from hoarding. 'Even if some (supermarket) shelves are emptied on one day, they will be replenished,' she promised, adding her thanks to those working in the food industry."
9,"Defiant bar owners ignore governors' orders to close and insist they'll stay open 'to make a living' as they risk arrest, having their food and liquor licenses revoked and daily $500 fines",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126379/Defiant-Ohio-bar-owners-ignore-governors-order-close-insist-theyll-stay-open-make-living.html,"Bar owners and staff are defying state orders to shut down venues in a bid to control crowd numbers and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Mike DeWine told the state of Ohio Sunday that venues were to remain closed to customers drinking or dining in but could offer takeout options. However Shamrock Inn owner Ed Gallek was caught serving patrons with his doors open for more business Tuesday, St Patrick's Day, telling reports he's 'trying to make a living'. Asked why he was open despite the order, Gallek is seen on video telling a Fox 8 reporter he doesn't want to say anything. Only two customers appeared to be in the Irish-themed venue but Galleck was seen leaning in closely to a patron, flouting recommendations to stay six feet from another person to stay safe from contracting the virus. 'I'm concerned about trying to make a living that's all. When they come and tell me to shut down, I will,' Gallek explained. Probed further on whether he's more concerned about trying to make a living than the public health, he pointed to people drinking at the bar and said: 'These guys are fine.' Galleck is risking having his liquor licence revoked and it could lead to a criminal charge. Fox 8 said when they contacted the Lake County Health Department, they said they would first send police to the venue to warn Galleck. The department did the same in a similar case and the person responsible - not the owner - is to be charged. Queen City Lounge was found to have a sign in the window saying 'members only' and was offering drinkings and a buffet. Forty people were inside the Cincinnati venue which is now padlocked and barricaded shut. Their liquor and food license could be removed and the owner was detained. 'They were operating as a bar. My understanding is they had a full buffet and it's unfortunate,'Assistant Chief Paul Neudigate, said. 'I understand that people do want to get out, but we're just like everybody else. We're staying at home and abiding by what the governor put out.' Elsewhere in Ohio polling stations were closed and a university parking lot was turned into a testing area for COVID-19. Pendleton, Oregon Rainbow Cafe owner Joanne McGee was serving green beer Tuesday despite receiving a call from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, EastOregon.comreported. Snapper's Bar and Grill in Clinton, Illinois was still open for business despite Governor J.B Pritzker ordering them shut until at least March 30. Owner Joe Sartie told the Pantagraph: 'I may lose this battle, but I run a business. I need to be open.' Sartie added to the Daily Beast: 'I'll run this place on my own if I have to. They are going to f**king crucify me. I'm going to lose everything.' Punishment state by state varies. The Oregon Governor's public safety advisor had to create and vet a decree Tuesday after McGee said: T'hey're going to have to come and physically shut me down.' Now venues face a $500 per day penalty and other citations. In some areas police have warned may not respond to some calls such as burglaries, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. In New York City in some of the most exclusive restaurants have been complying with orders and places such as Carbone and Peter Luger have changed operations to focus on takeout orders. Under Mayor Bill de Blasio's order bar and restaurant owners face being arrested if they break the city's strict lockdown rules and open their doors to customers, as the industry has gone into meltdown amid efforts to tackle the spread of coronavirus. More than 150,000 people across the city face an uncertain future as their workplaces shut their doors Monday night and threw their livelihoods into jeopardy. Some establishments including famous New York eateries Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe have promised to keep paying staff and to foot medical bills for workers struck down by the deadly virus. But many hospitality workers won't be so lucky and now face fears over how they will make rent and survive with no income for an indefinite time. About 154,400 people work in the city's bars, restaurants, cafes and food trucks, taking home about $4.7 billion in wages every year, according to a 2019 report from The Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment. The coronavirus crisis has left bartenders in New York City 'freaking out' after their earnings plummeted to zero, after previously making up to $550 a night in tips. Thousands of bartenders have been let go after the decision by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to shutter the city's bars and restaurants to stop the spread of the disease. With no sick pay, no vacation pay and no health insurance, several are rushing to sign up for unemployment benefits, which are a fraction of what they normally earn. Despite the glamorous illusion of the job, most bartenders earn just $10 an hour as a basic wage and rely on tips to make a living salary. Most live paycheck to paycheck and with no money coming in, a majority of bartenders fear being evicted because they can't pay their rent. In New York City, the nightlife industry makes $35 billion in annual revenue and supports about 300,000 workers. Now with several out of a job, there's been a spreadsheet set up where patrons can tip their favorite bartender, even though no drinks are being made. Even whiskey maker Jameson donated $500,000 to the Bartender's Guild for emergency grants to support its members. On Tuesday, Trump's administration addressed workers who rely heavily on tips, saying the White House is reviewing plans to give every American at least $1,000 within two weeks. But until financial relief comes through, many are anxious about how they will make it through the month. Some are applying for unemployment benefits, which amounts to just $500 a month.

10,"'It's NOT racist. It came from China!' Trump lashes out as he is challenged for calling coronavirus 'the Chinese virus', and REFUSING to condemn White House official who called it 'Kung Flu' to Asian reporter",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125915/Donald-Trump-triples-calling-coronavirus-Chinese-virus.html,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his use of the term 'China virus' to describe the coronavirus, saying 'it's not racist at all.' The president, repeatedly this week, has talked about the 'China virus,' a moniker that has been called racist. China expelled journalists from three major American news outlet in the wake of Trump's words. Trump, who started his Wednesday briefing by saying he had 'important developments in ourwar against the Chinese virus,'told reporters at the White House he used the description because the virus originated in Wuhan province of China. 'It's not racist at all. It comes from China, that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,' he said during a press briefing. And he argued he wasn't being racist to any Asian Americans with the term. 'I have a great love for all the people from our country, but as you know, China tried to say at one point that - maybe they've stopped now - that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen. It's not going to happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China,' he said. Some Chinese officials have pushed a conspiracy theory that the American military brought the coronavirus to their shores. Medical experts believe it originated in a meat market in Wuhan where exotic animals were butchered. And while President Trump argued the coronavirus came from China, he said he doesn't believe Beijing inflicted it on America but added Chinese officials could have issued an earlier warning. 'No, I donâ€™t believe they are inflicting I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice,' he said. He also did not condemn a White House official who called the disease the 'Kung flu' and said he wasn't worried about Asian Americans being put at risk in the wake of such rhetoric. 'Not all,' Trump said and then returned to his argument the virus came from China. 'I think they probably grew that 100 per cent. It comes from China.' Weijia Jiang, a reporter for CBS News, claimed on Tuesday a White House official referred to coronavirusas the 'Kung Flu' right to her face. Jiang was born in China and raised in West Virginia. Such comments have been condemned as racist. Earlier Wednesday, President Trump tripled down on using the term in a series of tweets. 'I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!,' the president wrote. 'I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the â€œbordersâ€ from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!,' he added. The president appeared to be pushing back at reports his response to the pandemic has taken on a more serious tone in recent days. Trump has been criticized for minimizing the disease in its early days but told reporters on Tuesday he's 'always' taken it seriously. 'I've always known this is a real - this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,' he said during a press briefing on the virus. President Trump's use of the phrase 'China virus' comes as tensions have escalated between Washington and Beijing in the wake of the trade war started by the president and the battle surrounding the origins of the coronavirus. And China has taken retaliatory measures against the United States. Officials there announced on Tuesday Beijing would expelAmerican journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. 'I'm not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well. I don't like seeing it at all, I'm not happy about that at all,' Trump said Wednesday of the expelled journalists. The United State also has expelled Chinese journalists. Last month, the Trump administration posed limits on the number ofChinese citizens who can work in the U.S. for five state-run Chinese news outlets that are seen as propaganda machines. The limits by the White House - capping the number of Chinese journalists at 100 - will force about 60 Chinese reporters from the United States. But Trump's use of the 'China virus' moniker has increased tensions. After President Trump tweeted on Monday about the 'China virus,' Beijing, the next day, demanded'the U.S. side correct the mistake immediately and halt its groundless accusations'. Trump defended his use of the term, sayingTuesday that he doesn't think it's inappropriate to call the coronavirus the 'Chinese virus' because that's where the disease originated. The president said he only started referring to the virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in that way after Beijing blamed the U.S. military for bringing the disease to its shores. 'Well China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false,' Trump said during a briefing in the White House press room. 'And rather than having an argument, I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China.' 'So I think it's a very accurate term,' he continued. 'But, no, I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody.' When a reporter said the term 'Chinese Virus' has a stigma around it that is seen as racist, Trump pushed back. 'No, I don't think so. No,' he said, flipping the switch: 'I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.' Chinese officials have floated a conspiracy that the U.S. Army brought coronavirus there when they participated in the Military World Games in Wuhan, China in October 2019. Trump did not say whether he would continue using the phrase when asked, but just minutes later in a meeting with tourism executives, the president again called it the 'Chinese virus.' He said he was talking to the industry leaders about 'what has happened since the Chinese Virus came about.' The tweet-for-tat came the day after Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, called China to accuse it of spreading conspiracy theories that the virus was the creation of the U.S. military. Contrasting conspiracy theories, that it was created by China as a tool for biological warfare, have been aired in pro-Trump circles in the U.S. And Pompeo himself has called it the Wuhan virus in a series of media appearances, as have fervently pro-Trump Republicans including Tom Cotton, the Arkansas senator, and Paul Gosar, an Arizona congressman who then had to go into self-quarantine over fears he was infected with it. Geng Shuang, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accused 'certain American politicians' of promoting stigmatization by connecting the novel coronavirus with China. He did not name President Trump specifically, but was referring to one of President Trump's tweet, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua. 'We express strong indignation and resolute opposition to this,' Geng said at a daily news briefing. The spokesperson stressed that the coronavirus outbreak had occurred in multiple places around the world and the urgent task was for the international community to join forces to curb the pandemic. 'The United States should mind its own business first, and then make constructive contributions to the international counter-epidemic collaboration and the maintenance of the global public health safety,' Geng continued. Anti-US sentiment is also growing in China as people on the country's Twitter-like Weibo has shown an outpouring of anger towards President Trump. One person said: 'Trump is the virus of the world'. Another typical comment accused: 'American virus!' On MondayPompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels 'to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,' the State Department said. Pompeo 'stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,' the department added. The State Department on Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in tweets last week in both Mandarin and English, suggested that 'patient zero' in the global pandemic may have come from the United States -- not the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. 'It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,' tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media. Scientists suspect that the virus first came to humans at a meat market in Wuhan that butchered exotic animals. Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to SARS-CoV-2 as the 'Wuhan virus' despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing. Yang issued a 'stern warning to the United States that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail,' the official Xinhua news agency said in its summary of the call with Pompeo. While COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the virus - has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries. The news comes as China tries to deflect blame for the contagion and reframe itself as a country that took decisive steps to buy the world time by placing huge swathes of its population under quarantine. The push to question the origin of the disease contradicts China's own initial assessment about the source of the virus, which has now killed more than 7,000 people worldwide. Gao Fu, head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January 'we now know the source of the virus is wild animals sold at the seafood market' in Wuhan. Chinese authorities themselves saw Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province as a threat as they placed the region of 56 million people under strict quarantine to contain the epidemic. But Beijing began sowing doubts in late February, when Zhong Nanshan, a respected expert affiliated with the National Health Commission, told reporters 'the epidemic first appeared in China, but didn't necessarily originate in China'. Scientists, however, have long suspected that the virus jumped from an animal at the Wuhan market to a human before spreading globally. The World Health Organization has said that while the exact path the virus took between its animal source and humans is still unclear, COVID-19 was 'unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019'. Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology at Imperial College London, said genetic analysis of coronavirus samples collected from around the world showed a common ancestor in China. 'This is not in any way blaming a particular country,' she told AFP."
11,"NY Gov. Cuomo blasts 'panic and fear' created by calls for a total NYC lockdown to fight coronavirus in veiled attack on De Blasio - but says 1,000-patient hospital ship will be sent to city's harbor",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125773/Cuomo-says-NO-shelter-place-order-Blasio-warned-New-Yorkers-prepared.html,"New York City will not be shutting down, governor Andrew Cuomo said today as he criticized the 'panic and fear' being created by calls for a total lockdown to fight coronavirus. March 1 â€“ One case (This was Westchester lawyer, counted as NY case) March 4 â€“ 3 March 5 â€“ 5 March 7 â€“ 12 March 9 â€“ 20 March 10 â€“ 36 March 11 â€“ 53 March 12 â€“ 95 March 13 â€“ 154 March 14 â€“ 183 March 15 â€“ 329 March 16 â€“ 463 March 17 â€“ 814 March 18 - 1339 The governor announced Wednesday a hospital ship, The Comfort, will be sent to New York city while ordering employers to keep 50 per cent of their workers at home. But in a veiled attack on Mayor Bill de Blasio he also blasted the 'panic and fear'being created by calls for a total NYC lockdown. The mayor had said Wednesday he would be talking with Cuomo later in the day. Asked on the Today show if he will recommend a shelter in place order, de Blasio said: 'I am almost at that point, I have to say, it has to be considered seriously.' But Cuomo, who would make the final call on a lockdown, said in a press conference Wednesday morning: 'The fear, the panic is a bigger problem than the virus'. The back-and-forth between the two officials has left some New York residents shaken and confused as many rush to grocery stores to stock up on necessities just 24 hours after bars and restaurants were restricted to takeout and delivery options only. Explaining his decision not to put the city on lockdown Cuomo added: 'I don't believe any policy works unless the geographic footprint is large enough. It can't just be New York City. 'Also shelter in place, you close down your health care system, you close down your food system, you close down your transportation system . And you close down businesses. That doesn't make sense to me because people need to eat travel etc.' 'Doing it this way, all work forces 50 per cent excluding social services, we'll see if that slows the spread. If it doesn't slow the spread we will reduce the number of workers even further.' He added: 'This is a public health crisis, but more than that I'm telling you worse than the virus is the fear that we're dealing with. 'The rumors and how they spread, that I'm going to be quarantined in my house, I'm going to be locked down, I better stock up on groceries. That's not going to happen, take a deep breath. We know what is going to happen here. People will get ill, they will resolve, people who are vulnerable we have to be more careful. 'The panic and the fear is wholly disconnected from the reality.' Gov. Cuomo also said Wednesday he had 'very good dialogue with President Donald Trump, telling reporters: 'We are fighting the same war, this is a war, we are in the same trench.' As of Wednesday morning, 2,382 people had tested positive in New York State, up more than 800 since Tuesday. In New York City cases went up from 814 on Tuesday to 1,339 people testing positive by Wednesday. Cuomo added:'All of the restrictions are statewide, they will track the trajectory of the disease. If we get that spread down, and we can handle it in the healthcare system we'll relax them as soon aspossible. 'Past data - China, South Korea - shows if you take dramatic action sooner then you recover sooner.' Cuomo had already contradicted the NYC mayor Tuesday evening, saying there will be no shelter in place order issued. Hours earlier de Blasio warned 8 million New Yorkers to be prepared for it. 'We've lost 10 people already it's increasing in a way, I don't even think our leaders in Washington begin to understand this but here in New York, we have the most cases of any state in the country',de Blasio said Wednesday morning. 'So what I was saying to people is get ready for the possibility. It's a decision we would only make with the state of New York, of course. But people have to realize at this point that this disease is going to put many, many people, thousands and tens of thousands of people's lives in danger.' Cuomo called decision to bring 1,000 bed military 'floating hospital' The Comfort to New York City harbor an 'extraordinary step'. He warned the state needs to increase its hospital bed capacity by 50,000 in the coming weeks. TheUSNS Comfort came to New York City in the days after September 11 2001, terrorist attacks. Itâ€™s not clear when it would arrive. Cuomo's team had already released a statement on the New York State's website in response to a possible shelter in place order. 'The emergency policies that have been issued are of statewide impact, and the Governor is making every effort to coordinate these policies with our surrounding states. 'Any blanket quarantine or shelter in place policy would require State action and as the Governor has said, there is no consideration of that for any locality at this time,' the statement reads. As the back and forth continued de Blasio said Tuesday that he would make a decision on whether to shut the city down entirely in the next 48 hours. 'New Yorkers should be prepared right now for the possibility of a shelter in place order. That has not happened yet but it is a possibility. That decision will be made in the next 48 hours,' he said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. He also signed an executive order to ban shared Ubers, Lyfts and other ride-shares. They are now limited to one person per car unless the two passengers are a couple, and de Blasio said he was going to be firm on the two passengers being a 'real' couple. De Blasio said Wednesday: 'People have to realize at this point that this disease is going to put many, many people, thousands and tens of thousands of people's lives in danger. 'We're going to have to do things very differently and if we even get to shelter-in-place, we're going to have to come up with huge new approaches to make sure people have enough food and medicine because they sure as hell don't have income right now. 'Washington is going to have to get real if there's unemployment, we need a massive federal relief program that looks like the great depression so people are whole economically so they will have money for food or medicine. That's what I fear. 'Right now we're in the midst of a crisis we have not seen for generations, Savannah, and yet the American military is being sidelined when they should be given the chance to get in this game and help us all.' Cuomo said healthcare experts have told him the virus is going to peak in New York in 45 days. Then, he anticipated needing between55,000 and 110,000 hospital beds, along 18,600 and 37, 200 ICU beds.At the moment, the state only has 53,000 beds and 3,000 ICU beds. De Blasio appeared on CNN on Tuesday morning and was asked whether city officials would follow San Francisco's lead in implementing the order, which would allow New Yorkers to leave their home only for food, medicine and exercise. 'We're absolutely considering that,' the mayor said. 'We're going to look at all other options, but it could get to that for sure for the whole country.' San Francisco announced it's version of shelter in place on Monday - preventing people from leaving their homes except for necessities for the next three weeks. 'This is an extraordinary time in our nation's history. This will go down in the history books as one of those moments of true crisis and confusion and chaos. 'I lived through 9/11. I remember the fear and the panic that existed in 9/11 when a single moment, your whole concept of life and society can be shaken. 'Where you need to see government perform at its best. You need to see people at their best.Everybody's afraid, everybody's nervous. How you respond, how you react.This is a character test for all of us. Cuomo has urged people, especially families, to get out of the house and take their children to state parks - where all fees have been waived to allow more visitors during the crisis. He said it was safe to be out in the open. Cuomo went on to say he too was feeling the strain of not being able to have physical contact with the people he loved. 'There is something to this lack of ability to connect. Don't hug. Don't kiss. 'We are emotional beings. It is important for us, in times of fear or stress to feel connected to someone.To feel comforted by someone,' he said. Cuomo added that it 'breaks his heart' that he cannot see his own daughter - who has not seen for two weeks. 'It frightens me to the core.' He said he told his daughter when he spoke to her how heartbroken he was not to be able to hold her and kiss her, but he urged the public to push through and said it was only a short amount of time. 'Be a little bit more sensitive. Understand the stress. Understand the fear. Be a little bit more loving, compassionate, cooperative and we will get through this time. 'We will lose people, yes. Like we lose people every year with the flu. We're going to be challenged and tested, there's going to be periods of chaos. 'We will learn from it and be better prepared the next time because this is not the last time my friends. This has been a growing rate of health emergencies and storms. 'We're going to get through it and we're going to get through it together.' Cuomo also spoke of the frantic scramble in trying to buy ventilators. 'China bought all the ventilators then South Korea bought all the ventilators then Italy bought all the ventilators,' he said. Trump insisted on Tuesday that he had ordered ventilators and medical supplies but it is unclear where from. 'It's NOT racist!' Donald Trump lashes out as he is challenged on using 'Chinese virus' President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his use of the term 'China virus' to describe the coronavirus, saying 'it's not racist at all.' The president, repeatedly this week, has talked about the 'China virus,' a moniker that has been called racist. China expelled journalists from three major American news outlet in the wake of Trump's words. Trump, who started his Wednesday briefing by saying he had 'important developments in our war against the Chinese virus,' told reporters at the White House he used the description because the virus originated in Wuhan province of China. 'It's not racist at all. It comes from China, that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,' he said during a press briefing. 'I have a great love for all the people from our country, but as you know, China tried to say at one point that - maybe they've stopped now - that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen. It's not going to happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China,' he said. Some Chinese officials have pushed a conspiracy theory that the American military brought the coronavirus to their shores. Medical experts believe it originated in a meat market in Wuhan where exotic animals were butchered. And while President Trump argued the coronavirus came from China, he said he doesn't believe Beijing inflicted it on America but added Chinese officials could have issued an earlier warning. 'No, I donâ€™t believe they are inflicting I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice,' he said. He also did not condemn a White House official who called the disease the 'Kung flu' and said he wasn't worried about Asian Americans being put at risk in the wake of such rhetoric. 'Not all,' Trump said and then returned to his argument the virus came from China. 'I think they probably grew that 100 per cent. It comes from China.'

12,Baltimore Mayor begs residents to stop shooting each other and 'clogging up' hospital beds which need to be kept open for coronavirus patients after SEVEN people are shot in a single night,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127379/Baltimore-Mayor-begs-residents-stop-gun-violence-hospitals-clear-coronavirus.html,"The mayor of Baltimore is begging residents to stop shooting one another to allow doctors and nurses to focus on saving coronavirus patients and not gunshot wound victims. In a statement on Wednesday, the Mayor Jack Young said: 'I want to reiterate how completely unacceptable the level of violence is that we have seen recently. 'We will not stand for mass shootings and an increase in crime. 'For those of you who want to continue to shoot and kill people of this city, weâ€™re not going to tolerate it. 'Weâ€™re going to come after you and weâ€™re going to get you. 'We cannot clog up our hospitals and their beds with people that are being shot senselessly because weâ€™re going to need those beds for people infected with the coronavirus. 'And it could be your mother, your grandmother or one of your relatives. So take that into consideration,' he said. Seven people were shot by one person in a neighborhood of the city on Tuesday. The motives is not yet known but CBS Baltimore reports the gunman wore all black and a black ski mask to carry out the shootings. Five needed hospital care and are in a stable condition. The other two who were shot walked into the hospital themselves but did not need treatment. There are also five confirmed cases of coronavirus in Baltimore, but the number is expected to rise drastically as more people are tested around the country. The Navy has deployed two hospital ships - one to New York and one to the West Coast - to alleviate the strain on hospitals by taking in patients with non-coronavirus illnesses. The government has also made a plea to retired healthworkers who are able to to come back to the workforce. There are now more than 7,000 cases of coronavirus in the US and 115 people have died. The government's official advice is for people to stay at home, work from home, avoid groups of 10 or more and stay 6ft away from people at all times. They are not implementing a full lock-down like in Italy or France. Instead, they are urging people to take the necessary precautions now in an effort to stop the virus's growth.Along with a shortage of ventilators and hospital beds, there is a severe shortage of medical masks and gloves. Hospitals are now being told to delay all non-essential procedures. 'We need millions of masks, we need ventilators. We have ventilators but we need a lot more,' President Trump said. Vice President Mike Pence said there were 10,000 ventilators in a 'stockpile' currently but that the government had ordered 'thousands more'."
13,Telehealth companies are facing a massive influx of patients and huge backlogs as coronavirus spreads - and will see more as Trump expands services to Medicare recipientsÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8126227/Telehealth-services-face-influx-patients-huge-backlogs-coronavirus-outbreak.html,"Telehealth companies are struggling to handle the influx of patients turning to online and phone services as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. Some companies say their number of visits have doubled or quadrupled over the last two weeks, and as a result - people are seeing longer wait times. Then, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump expanded telemedecine services to all Americans covered by Medicare. This will help millions of older people - and others at high-risk - to receive care while following public health advice to stay home. But this also means that these companies will be receiving millions of new patients with systems that can only handle so many people and not enough doctors to treat all of them. Telehealth companies told STAT they were first excited about the increase in new customers, but they are now experiencing a large pileup. 'You can get the technology to support these astounding volumes,' Roy Schoenberg, CEO of telemedicine company American Well, told the website. 'But you're very quickly getting to a point where the supply of medical services isn't there. We need to have enough clinicians to allow us to handle that incoming volume.' Several companies are trying to upgrade their systems, both to handle the rising number of patients and the numbers of doctors providing virtual care. American Well said that despite two recent system updates, patients often have to wait half-an-hour or more for a visit. Jefferson Health, a telemedicine company based in Pennsylvania, says it has generally seen a rise in business during flu season, when miserably sick people want to avoid an in-person visit. But in the last week, thenumber of telemedicine visits quadrupled, according to HealthDay. Dr Judd Hollander, an emergency medicine physician at Jefferson Health, told the site that new providers are being trained to meet the demand. 'We're basically begging anyone with some spare minutes to take on a visit,' he said. Despite the difficulty to provide virtual care to so many, he says he encourages everyone to stay home as much as possible. Doctor on Demand, a San Francisco-based telehealth company, said it has seen a two-fold increase in patients and that wait times have gotten longer. The number of suspected cases of COVID-19 we are seeing doubles each day,' president and chief commercial officer, Robin Cherry, told STAT. Worldwide, more than 204,000 people have been infected and more than 8,000 people have died. In the US, there are more than 6,500 confirmed cases across all 50 states and more than 100 people have died."
14,Navy dispatches two hospital ships - Comfort and Mercy - to New York City and along the West Coast to ease strain on medical facilities for non-coronavirus patientsÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126925/Navy-dispatches-two-ships-act-floating-hospitals.html,"Two Navy ships - the USNS Comfort and the USNS Mercy - are being turned into huge floating hospitals to help treat the wave of coronaviruspatients who will need care when hospitals become overwhelmed but they won't be ready for weeks as military medical staff are scrambled to fill them. The ships provide 1,000 beds each but it is unclear whether they will bring other crucial supplies, like ventilators and surgical masks. They will both be manned by Navy personnel and will house non-coronavirus patients, leaving the city's hospitals free to take in those who have tested positive for COVID-19. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the Comfort was dispatched to New York City where it provided medical treatment to some first responders at ground zero. In the week after its arrival, it provided food and shelter to 10,000 relief workers who were tasked with working at the disaster zone. It is unclear where the Mercy will be docked.President Trump said on Wednesday that he had not yet decided where it will be stationed but it will be somewhere along the West Coast, possibly San Diego. It came as Gov. Andrew Cuomo assured New Yorkers that the city will not be placed into full lockdown mode, as Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested, but that extra measures were being taken to stop the spread of the virus. As of Wednesday afternoon,14,000 had been tested for coronavirus in the state of New York alone and 2,383 have tested positive.Of that number, 23 per cent - 549 people - have been hospitalized. There are now more than 7,000 cases of coronavirus in the US and 121 people have died. Healthcare workers are terrified that soon, the sheer number of people needing intensive care will overwhelm hospitals across the country. Field and expeditionary hospitals have also been advised to prepare to be deployed, White House officials said on Wednesday at a press conference where President Trump admitted that the virus - which he is insisting on calling the Chinese Flu - 'snuck up on us'. The ships alone cannot address the shortage of beds, ventilators or hospital staff that is looming but they are the first indicators of military intervention in the crisis. USNS Comfort arrived Pier 92 on the west side of Manhattan about 8.30pm on September 14, 2011, three days after the attacks. It was staffed with 300 Navy medical personnel, and 61 civilian mariners who were deployed to assist with the medical care of injured survivors, but their mission turned logistical as they cared for first responders working at ground zero. In the week after its arrival, it provided food and shelter to more than 10,000 relief workers. It provided 30,000 meals to first responders, and did 4,000lbs of laundry. When it needed to, torn clothing and boots were replaced with donations from the Red Cross. The ship's clinic saw 561 emergency disaster workers for cuts, respiratory ailments, fractures and other minor injuries.It also provided 500 mental health consults to help relief workers mentally prepare before they headed back to ground zero. The crew were not permitted to leave the pier where USNS Comfort was docked, but on one occassion Navy Commander Ralph Jones - director of surgical Services on board the ship, and a surgical oncologist - led a team of four people to the disaster site to assess the damage. 'All of a sudden, I had about 40 or 50 firefighters gathered around me, crying. They needed help and a break, but they were afraid that if they left the scene, they woulnd't be able to come back.' The ship was also designated by the City of New York as the secure location for emergency landings for VIP personnel. It also supported military efforts in the region, safely conducting 16 launch and recoveries for U.S. Marine Corps SH-60s and U.S. Army Black Hawks, as well as NYPD Police H-1 Aircraft. - SOURCE: MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM 'I look at it as a war time.That's what we're fighting. It's a very tough situation. 'You have to close parts of the economy that six weeks ago were the best we've ever had. 'But we're doing it and doing it well. The American people have been incredible. For the most part, they've been really incredible.

Vice President Mike Pence said there were 10,000 ventilators in a 'stockpile' currently but that the government had ordered 'thousands more'. On Wednesday morning, an ER doctor in Seattle told Good Morning America that the hospital 'down the street' from him had run out of ventilators. The government is now putting together a stimulus plan to try to alleviate the economic hardship the pandemic is causing. The Surgeon General Jerome Adamssaid that the practical advice for Americans was to stay at home for the next 15 days and avoid social gatherings but it would 'likely' take longer to stunt the spread of the virus. 'If we can get America to pitch in for the next 15 days, we can flatten the curve. 'Fifteen days is likely not going to be enough to get us all the way through, but we need to lean into it now to bend the curve over the next 15 days and at that point we will reassess. 'What you're talking about is our 15 days to stop the spread. 'We want them to avoid gatherings of 10 or more, unnecessary travel, work from home if at all possible. 'When we look at the data, our numbers are where Italy's are two to three weeks ago. 'Do we want to go the way of Italy or do we want to go the way of South Korea and China who were actually able to level off the peak and decrease the numbers,' he said, referring to the two countries' harsh approach which involved people self-containing weeks ago and staying home. Adams said he felt the nation was 'turning a corner' in the amount of people taking the virus seriously. 'We'restarting to turn a corner. People really are [sensing the urgency]. 'I have a 15-year-old son and a 14-year-old son at home. 'They don't care what dad says, even if he is the surgeon general, but by golly do they know that Kevin Durant just got diagnosed with the coronavirus and they're taking it seriously,' he said, referring to the Brooklyn Nets player who, along with three teammates, has the virus. 'Wewant people to understand; chances are you don't have it and chances are if you do have it you will recover.' The US has now closed its border with Canada to all non-essential crossings. Trump said there was no 'tipping point' for the decision that he and Trudeau decided it was necessary.The president reiterated on Wednesday how unprecedented the system is. 'Nobody ever had to test the entire nation for the flu... this has never been done before,' he said. The government is partnering with the private sector to push out new, efficient tests. What is trying to be avoided is a full shut down. Cuomo slammed the 'fear and panic' generated by suggestions that it was on the cards at his own press conference, saying: 'The fear, the panic is a bigger problem than the virus. 'All of the restrictions are statewide, they will track the trajectory of the disease. 'If we get that spread down, and we can handle it in the healthcare system we'll relax them as soon as possible. 'Past data - China, South Korea - shows if you take dramatic action sooner then you recover sooner.' Cuomo had contradicted the mayor Tuesday evening, saying there will be no shelter in place order issued. Hours earlier de Blasio warned 8 million New Yorkers to be prepared for it. Gov. Cuomo said he had 'very good dialogue with President Donald Trump, telling reporters Wednesday morning: 'We are fighting the same war, this is a war, we are in the same trench. Those comments directly contradicted Mayor de Blasio, who confirmed that as of Tuesday evening the number of coronavirus cases in the Big Apple has surged to 923 with 10 deaths just hours. He warned cases in the city will soon hit 10,000. 'We've lost 10 people already it's increasing in a way, I don't even think our leaders in Washington begin to understand this but here in New York, we have the most cases of any state in the country', de Blasio said Wednesday morning. 'So what I was saying to people is get ready for the possibility. 'It's a decision we would only make with the state of New York, of course. 'But people have to realize at this point that this disease is going to put many, many people, thousands and tens of thousands of people's lives in danger.'"
15,Rikers Island inmate 'tests positive for coronavirus' days as New York City considers FREEING 'vulnerable and sick' prisoners,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127851/Rikers-Island-inmate-tests-positive-coronavirus-days-guard-diagnosed.html,"A prisoner atRikers Island correctional facility has reportedly tested positive for coronavirus. The inmate is said to be the first in New York city custody to have contracted the disease, The Daily News reports. Union officials announced Wednesday that an unidentified New York City correction officer who works at Rikers Island has also been struck down with the virus. This makes them the second Department of Correction employee to test positive for the virus, after an investigator died from the disease on Monday. It comes as notorious inmates across US prisons are seeking 'get out of jail free' cards, citing concerns that the virus could spread among the prison system. Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff and infamous cocaine kingpin Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela have both made cases to be released. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that officials are 'evaluating right now people who might be particularly high-risk in terms of vulnerability to the virus'. News of the confirmed case in Rikers Island comes after Weinstein was returned to the facility after spending five days in hospital for 'dangerously high blood pressure'. His spokesperson Juda Engelmayer told DailyMail.com Wednesday morning that the disgraced producer, 67, is 'fine' and said he had not come into contact with the infected individual. 'Harvey is fine and has not been in contact with the officer. He also is expected to be taken to a state facility within a few days,' said Engelmayer. Weinstein has since left the notorious prison and is being transferred to the Downstate Correctional facility in Fishkill, New York, DailyMail.com can reveal. The site, which houses 1,800 inmates, is about 60 miles north of New York City and is the processing center for new inmates. Weinstein could remain there or could be taken to another facility -the Mohawk Correctional Facility in Rome. He spent the last two days at Rikers before being taken to Fishkill, which houses 1,800 inmates. Weinstein was sentenced last Wednesday to 23 years behind bars for rape and a criminal sex act in the landmark case. He had been transported to Rikers Island after sentencing but was rushed toBellevue Hospital in Manhattan hours later after he complained of chest pains. He was later released from hospital and transferred back to Rikers Island.   The rapist is in poor health, having also spent multiple days in the hospital after his conviction last month with different ailments. Concerns have been mounting for prison officers and inmates across the US amid the coronavirus pandemic, as high prison populations, confined spaces and poor hygiene could make facilities hotbeds for the disease. New York's Department of Correction confirmed that an employee in the Investigation Division died on Monday from the killer virus. David Perez, 56, had a pre-existing health condition and only had limited contact with inmates, officials said. In the latest case in the Rikers Island correction officer, it is not yet known who or how many inmates and staff they may have come into contact with. However, New York City's jail system is home to around 8,000 inmates, with the majority at Rikers Island so the implications could be significant. Dozens of inmates at Rikers Island are now pleading to be released amid fears that the facility could fast become a breeding ground for the disease. In New York, public defenders have asked judges to release older and at-risk inmates from the city's jails, saying pretrial confinement 'creates the ideal environment for the transmission of contagious disease.' 'I truly believe the jails are ticking time bombs,' said David Patton, executive director of the Federal Defenders of New York. 'They're overcrowded and unsanitary in the best of times. They don't provide appropriate medical care in the best of times, and these certainly are not the best of times.' The global outbreak has become something of a 'get out of jail' card for hundreds of low-level inmates across the US, and hard-timers too are seeking their freedom citing concerns that it's not a matter of if but when the deadly illness sweeps through the prison system. Among those pleading for compassionate release or home detention are the former head of the Cali drug cartel, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen and Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff. 'He is in poor health. He is 81 years old,' David Oscar Markus, the attorney for cocaine kingpin Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela, wrote in emergency court papers this week seeking his release after serving about half of a 30-year drug-trafficking sentence. 'When (not if) COVID-19 hits his prison, he will not have much of a chance.' The 81-year-old Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence for bilking thousands of investors in a $17.5 billion Ponzi scheme, had asked last month to be released early in light of his terminal kidney disease. His attorney is now calling on all at-risk federal prisoners to be released for their own safety. 'The federal prison system has consistently shown an inability to respond to major crises,' Madoff attorney Brandon Sample told The Associated Press. 'My concerns are even more amplified for prisoners at federal medical centers and those who are aged.' Prosecutors have argued against Rodriguez-Orejuela's emergency request and noted that the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, where both he and Madoff are serving time has not had any staff or inmates diagnosed with the virus, and staff are being screened upon entry. America's nearly 7,000 jails, prisons and correction facilities are an ideal breeding ground for the virus, as dangerous as nursing homes and cruise ships but far less sanitary. Fears are mounting that stepped-up cleanings and a temporary halt to visitations at many lockups across the country will not make up for the fact that ventilation behind bars is often poor, inmates sleep in close quarters and share a small number of bathrooms. Prisons across several US states have started ramping up measures to protect inmates, releasing hundreds to decrease prison populations in an effort to combat the potential spread. New York City's Board of Correction has made calls for all high-risk inmates to be released immediately from the city's prisons, but officials are yet to approve the move. 'The City must begin this process now,' it said in a statement Tuesday. 'The City's jails have particular challenges to preventing disease transmissions on a normal day and even more so during a public health crisis.' The NYC Correction Officers' Benevolent Association also warned that correction officers' lives are being put at risk by the 'reckless' rules. 'It's very sad that we have to remind the Board of Correction that their mandate, per the city's Charter, is to advocate for the welfare of everyone in the Correction Department, not just the inmates. Their latest asinine proposal to start letting inmates out of jail who are 'high risk' to this virus, regardless of their risk to public safety, is beyond irresponsible,' the statement from President Elias Husamudeensaid Tuesday. 'Instead of recklessly letting inmates out, call for the city to ramp up its efforts to bring in more masks, gloves, hand sanitizers, and other vital supplies for the men and women who must also put their health at risk by showing up to work every day, providing care, custody, and control. Correction Officers' lives matter too.' New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that the city is considering such a move to release inmates. City officials are 'evaluating right now people who might be particularly high-risk in terms of vulnerability to the virusâ€¦ and determine if, case by case, any of those individuals should be taken out of our jail system,' de Blasio said. This would mean the release of inmates with pre-existing health conditions who are deemed low risk to the rest of the population. De Blasio also  announced that if people have 'flu-like symptoms' when being arrested, they 'will not be taken to a precinct or to central booking' but there will 'specific methodology' used for their booking.  This will includethe use of video conference systems to limit contact between those people and first responders. In Brooklyn, 'low-level crimes' will also not be prosecuted, to limit potential exposure to the virus for employees and visitors. 'During this public health emergency, it is imperative that we also protect those who might be exposed to the coronavirus during the procedures of arrest, processing and detention in Central Booking,' District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said Tuesday in a statement posted to Twitter, adding that they will'immediately decline to prosecute low-level offenses that don't jeopardize public safety'. In Los Angeles County, the prison population has decreased by 600 people already to combat the potential spread of thecoronavirus among inmates. Early release is being granted to those with less than 30 days on their sentence, reducing inmates from 17,076 to 16,459 since the end of February. The LA County sheriff is also asking officers to cite and release offenders when possible, which has reduced the daily number of arrests from 300 to 60. The moves in LA County, where there are 94 coronavirus cases and one death, have seen daily arrests drop from 300 to 60, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said Monday at a news conference. He added that the aggregate bond amount for people to be booked also went up from $25,000 to $50,000. 'Our population within the jail is a vulnerable population just by virtue of who they are and where they're located,' he said. 'So, we're protecting that population from potential exposure.' There are already nine inmates in the county in isolation at a correctional treatment center, 21 inmates in quarantine at the Men's Central Jail and five in quarantine at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility. Staff in these locations are said to be taking the temperature of anyone entering, looking for fevers. Prison staff are also at risk and several have already been placed in self-isolation. 'Over the weekend, we've had several of our personnel come into contact, and they have been self-isolated,' Villanueva said. 'However, fortunately, no one has actually tested positive for the virus.' All 122 federal prisons and many of the 1,700-plus state prisons across the US have banned visitors and volunteers to try to prevent an outbreak in the facilities. The Federal Bureau of Prisons announced its ban Friday, joining most state and county prisons. Lawyer visits have also been banned for 30 days. In response, many federal prisons are increasing the number of prisoner phone calls or the total number of minutes allotted. Prisons in Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio and South Dakota are looking to expand video calling abilities for inmates. In Cleveland, Ohio, Cuyahoga County's common pleas court held extra hearings on Saturday to try and clear the prison population, releasing 200 people since Friday. Those released were said to be low-level, non-violent inmates who have been placed on probation or released by having their bond reduced to a manageable level. 'We are trying to make as much room as possible, so when this virus hits our jail, the jail can deal with these people, quarantine them and deal with it instead of letting them sit there and infect the whole entire jail,'said Administrative Judge Brendan Sheehan. 'You gotta remember, the goal of this is to protect the community and the safety of the inmates. If someone's a serious violent person, well, we're using our discretion to make sure the community's safe also,' he added. And in Cook County in Illinois, talks are underway to begin the compassionate release of inmates with exceptional health care needs who don't pose a threat or a flight risk. Sheriff Tom Dart said the first of those early exits was secured on Monday. 'The office has already secured the release of several detainees deemed to be highly vulnerable to COVID-19, including a pregnant detainee and another detainee who was hospitalized for treatment not related to the virus,' the sheriff's office said in a statement. 'Additionally, staff are reaching out to other jurisdictions regarding detainees who are in custody due to outstanding warrants on low-level offenses. Sheriff's staff are asking those jurisdictions to either quash those warrants or geographically limit them so that those detainees can be released from Cook County Jail.' New arrivals in Cook County Jail, which has a population of 5,600, will now be kept in a receiving area to be monitored for symptoms before being placed with the general population and in Illinois state prisons, the 40,000 inmates plus staff will have increased access to hand santitizer and soap. In Massachusetts, Essex County Sheriff Kevin Coppinger's office revealed that 30 men who had been in community sober homes are now at the jail's pre-release center so that they could be monitored for illness. Sheriff Coppinger said that it was so treatment could be provided on site if the men became ill. And in Houston, Texas, the Harris County Juvenile Court announced that the court wing will be fully closed to all until further notice. A person who had been at the court tested positive for the coronavirus, as did an employee at a correctional facility in Pennsylvania, where 34 inmates and staffers are now in quarantine.  The preventative actions come afterevidence from previous outbreaks, such as an outbreak of mumps in Texas and New Jersey jails in 2019, highlighted the risk to the country's prison population. Prisoners havelimited access to basic hygiene measures and high rates of existing health issues. Those being held in handcuffs also can't cough into their elbow as advised and alcohol-based sanitizer is considered contraband in many US prisons. U.S. prisoners have a higher than average rate of HIV and are more likely to be smokers than the general population. And they are an aging population. From 1990 to 2012, the US prison population aged 55 and older increased by 550%. Inmates have no way to social distance or self-isolate if there was an outbreak in a prison. 'You can't keep a 2- to 3-foot distance from inmates, and they can't keep that distance themselves,' Ray Coleman Jr., a teacher at the federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, told CNN. Some experts have advised that the only way to fight against a prison coronavirus outbreak is to reduce the number of imprisoned people. This method was used in Iran, the country with the third worst outbreak, with 70,000 prisoners temporarily released after China reported three provinces with more than 500 cases in prisons during the height of their outbreak. 'In the best of scenarios, we would only hope to delay this,' Josiah Rich, a Brown University epidemiologist and director of the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights, told The Guardian. 'And because we have so many ill people behind bars, it's going to get there, it's going to spread like wildfire.' The United States accounts for 22 percent of the world's prison population with around 2.3 million people incarcerated. "

17,"NYPD 'is preparing to increase cops' 8-hr shifts to 12-hr shifts to make up for the 1,800 cops who have called out sick due to coronavirus",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126775/NYPD-cops-12-hour-shifts-deal-growing-numbers-officers-coronavirus.html,"The NYPD is preparing cops for 12-hour shifts and making plans to place investigators back on patrol to deal with the rapidly growing number of officers who have reported out sick due to coronavirus, a source exclusively told DailyMail.com. Though the number of cops on leave is not publicly available, a police source said there may be as many as 1,800 police officers not reporting for work because of coronavirus and other reasons. The number is expected to swell in the coming weeks. If the number reaches 3,000, the NYPD is discussing switching to 12-hour patrols, the source said. Typically, cops work shifts of just over 8 hours. If the number hits 6,000, then investigators who work in the detective bureau, intelligence and counterterrorism will be assigned back to patrol, according to the source.  Investigators are already being told to bring in uniforms and equipment in preparation for this contingency. DailyMail.com has reached out to the Deputy Commissioner of Public Information for comment but did not receive a response before publication. Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a press conference on Wednesday that he has 'mandated NYC and all local governments to have masks provided to their police departments.' Cuomo confirmed the number of positive cases in New York state has reached more than 2,000, with 1,339 of the cases being in New York City. He added: 'Every police department has been advised to expect people to get ill. You're talking about a public facing agency.' Now, the NYPD is looking to not just maintain adequate policing, but also reduce the chances that cops will infect each other. 'We have to have cops on the street,' one official explained. 'We need to maintain a sufficient number of officers and maintain patrols to prevent chaos, prevent looting and enforce all the new regulations being imposed.' 'It's also safer to have 12 hour shifts because we're splitting people up and having less overlap between shifts,' the official added. 'It's less opportunity to infect each other because we're not criss crossing as much.' The NYPD's Chief of Patrol Edward Delatorre and Deputy Commissioner for Employee Relations Robert Ganley have tested positive for coronavirus. An officer in Manhattan's 1st police precinct also tested positive, prompting nearly 30 officers in that station house to stay home. 'There's concern among the rank and file about getting sick, of course,' another police source noted. 'And the rank and file does not feel we're adequately prepared. The department should identify people who have been exposed so that we're all aware of the potential risk to our own health so we can take precautions. 'We don't want everybody infected.' But Chief of Patrol Fausto Pichardo said in aninternal video message to all NYPD cops that they should 'keep working', even if they encounter someone who has coronavirus, according to the New York Post on Wednesday. 'We learn more about the COVID-19 pandemic every day, and as we do, our best practices to keep members of the service safe evolve. 'At this time, the Centers for Disease Control and New York City Department of Health, in keeping with the guidance to health care workers, are recommending that a member of the service who has close contact â€” and that's defined as less than six feet for more than a few minutes â€” to an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, well, they can keep working.'"
18,"US Air Force flies 500,000 coronavirus testing kits in from Italy to Tennessee to help meet demand, on quiet mission named Reach 911Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127511/PICTURED-Air-Force-flies-500-000-coronavirus-testing-kits-Italy-quiet-Reach-911-mission.html,"The US Air Force has flown 500,000 coronavirus testing kits to the country from Italy as the confirmed number of cases surpassed 7,800 on Tuesday and the number of deaths over 121. An image showing the aircraft filled with the tests on Monday was posted on social media alongside the caption: 'Got to be part of something special last night.' The plane took off from Aviano Air Base Monday afternoon and touched down in Memphis, Tennessee with a person on board sharing online that they 'got to be part of something special last night'. Showing the precious cargo stretched across the aircraft, the caption highlighted that 'these pallets right here are 500,000 covid-19 testing kits that the aircrew I was a part of' had responsibility for, according to the poster. The post has since been removed. DefenseOne.com reports that the authenticity of the post has been verified. Air Force Chief of staff, General David Goldfein, has not confirmed the shipment mentioned in the social media post but said in a press conference Wednesday: 'We've just made a pretty significant movement into Memphis.' Defense One reports the C-17 aircraft touched down at Memphis International Airport which is a major FedEx hub that would allow onward commercial flights to carry the kits around the rest of the country. Citing a source that is familiar with the mission, the website said the quiet mission was called Reach 911. Similar missions are expected to occur over the next few days as the United States Air Force (USAF) has been flying spare parts to the Aviano base. USAF declined to comment and the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Goldfein said USAF has implemented procedures such as taking the temperatures of Air Force members and isolating them when necessary, plus focusing on 'minimizing movement, keeping them in a bubble'. 'We can move a lot of test kits on a C-17 or a C-5,' Goldstein said, but it means those planes will be out of action for other missions or training. The setup of Air Force control rooms and other spaces have had to change amid the outbreak. By Wednesday seven had tested positive for COVID-19. The Air Force has canceled big calendar events due to the pandemic and Goldstein alongside other big leaders have been teleworking at least three days per week. Donald Trump has been criticized for the delay in testing Americans. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) never discussed providing coronavirus testing kits to the US in the early days of the outbreak. By the end of February, the WHO had shipped hundreds of thousands of test kits around the world - but the US was not among them. Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the WHO, told DailyMail.com that no discussions occurred between the UN health agency and the CDC about providing tests to the US - nor did the WHO offer to send tests. 'This is consistent with experience since the US does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity,' he said in a statement. The WHO published guidelines on January 17 for any nation that was planning to manufacture tests for the virus. However, the CDC told media on the same day that it had chosen to develop its own version of the test. The CDC shipped its first batch of kits to laboratories across the US on February 5. According to CNN, the WHO announced the next day that it had shipped 250,000 kits to at least 70 countries. Less that a week later, several state labs said the CDC diagnostic was returning 'inconclusive results.' This forced the federal health agency to re-manufacture components of the kit, although its unclear what defect occurred. Ever since the CDC started to address this issue, delays have continued. As of Wednesday, just 4,255 specimens have been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19 at CDC labs, according to the CDC's website. However, this does not include tests conducted at US public health laboratories, commercial laboratories and some hospitals. Meanwhile, there have been no reports of delays from countries that received testing kits from the WHO. South Korea, by comparison, has tested more than 270,000 people - about 700 times as many people as the US has. It's unclear whether using the WHO's protocol would have delayed testing the US. There was also plenty of red tape for US public health labs in all 50 states to be granted authorization to test for coronavirus, which didn't occur until March 9. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence announced that any American can be tested for coronavirus as long as a doctor approves it. The move appears to expand upon previous criteria needed for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But how do you determine if you have symptoms ofCOVID-19 and when you should see a doctor? We break down everything you need to know about being tested for the virus that has infected more than 120 Americans and killed at least nine. WHAT ARE THE LATEST GUIDELINES FOR BEING TESTED? There are three groups of people that the CDC recommends get tested. 1. People with symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath who have been in 'close contact' with someone confirmed to have coronavirus 2. Patients with symptoms who have traveled to areas affected by the virus within the last 14 days 3. Those with symptoms who need to be hospitalized and no other cause for their illness is found. They don't need to have a travel history or exposure to another patient HOW DOES THIS DIFFER FROM THE PREVIOUS CRITERIA? When the CDC first began testing, only those with a travel history to China - where the outbreak emerged - or those who had been exposed to a confirmed coronavirus patient were tested. However, the agency says its criteria for testing is always 'subject to change as additional information becomes available.' WHAT TO DO IF YOU NEED A TEST? Health officials strongly advise that anyone who believes they may be infected not show up unannounced at their doctor's office in case they expose others to the highly-contagious disease. Instead, the CDC suggests immediately calling your physician or healthcare provider. 'Your healthcare professional will work with your state's public health department and CDC to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19,' the CDC's website states. If you are suspected of having the virus, you will most likely get tested at a hospital. The test involves getting a swab of the patient's nostril and throat. If the patient has a wet cough, a sample of sputum (a mixture of saliva and mucus) will also be collected. WHY HAS IT BEEN DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET TESTED? There have been multiple reports of people not having accessing to get tested. The first batch of test kits that the CDC sent to state and local health departments were faulty, which led to a delay. Secondly, the CDC had strict criteria for testing, which led to missed diagnoses of people who caught the virus from so-called 'community spread,' meaning it's unknown how they were infected. A third reasonis that some health departments did not leave the decision to test up to doctors as the CDC suggested. For instance, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health initially required doctors to call a hotline to determine if their patients met CDC criteria for testing. Then, before the test could be administered, it had to be authorized at the State Public Health Lab. WILL IT BE EASIER TO GET TESTED NOW? Since the CDC's testing fiasco, several health departments have either received new kits from the federal agency or made their own. Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) policy so allow more labs can apply for approval to test for the virus. The CDC that 75,000 test kits are currently available and more are being manufactured. FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Han told reporters on Monday that close to one million people would be testedby the end of the week. But figures from the Association of Public Health Laboratories show that likely no more than 100,000 people would be tested by week's end."
19,The US will NOT be included in the WHO's trial of experimental treatments for coronavirus because it has not committed to the project yet - but 10 other countries have,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8127451/The-NOT-committed-WHOs-trial-experimental-coronavirus-treatments.html,"The US will not be part of a new trial led by the World Health Organization examining which treatments work best against coronavirus. The so-called 'SOLIDARITY trial' will see researchers from several different countries compare the effects of different drugs on the highly-infectious disease. Included in the trial are remdesivir, originally conceived as a drug to fight Ebola, and an anti-malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization's director-general, said eight countries had committed to joining the trial, but that America was not among them. 'This large, international study is designed to generate the robust data we need, to show which treatments are the most effective,' Dr Tedros told reporters on Wednesday. The SOLIDARITY trial provides simplified procedures to enable even hospitals that have been overloaded to participate.' Countries that will participate include Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Although the US wasn't named as one of the participating nations, Dr Ghebreyesus said he 'trust[s] many more will join.' Dr Tedros also praised the generosity of the global community for contributing more than $143 million USD to the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund. He then encouraged countries around the world to rigorously isolate, test and treatment all suspected to prevent community spread. Hydroxychloroquine and remdesvir are two of just several drugs being repurposed to fight coronavirus. French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, which makes malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, is being temporarily used for the management of coronavirus. But the company said there is insufficient data to determine the drug's efficacy and that any use should be considered 'off-label.' In the case of remdesvir, the medication has been shown to fight against coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is a cousin of the new virus. More recently, it was found to help relieve symptoms in the first American coronavirus patient while he was hospitalized. During the press briefing, the WHO also hit back at President Donald Trump for continuing to refer to the novel coronavirus as the 'Chinese virus.' 'Viruses know no borders and they don't care your ethnicity or the color of your skin or how much money you have in the bank,' DrMike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program, replied. However, he stressed that experts stop pointing fingers at each other. 'This is a time for solidarity, this is a time for facts, this is a time to move forward together. There is no blame in this,' Dr Ryan said. Worldwide, more than 216,000 people have been infected and more than 8,800 people have died. In the US, there are more than 7,800 confirmed cases in all 50 states and 121 deaths."
20,West Virginia Senator says the state reported no coronavirus cases up until yesterday because it had no tests available but now it will be 'catastrophic',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126493/WV-Sen-says-state-reported-no-coronavirus-cases-yesterday-no-tests.html,"A West Virginia Senator has said the only reason they did not report any cases of coronavirus until yesterday was because they did not have the tests to find out whether or not anyone was carrying it until then. Until Tuesday, the state was the only one in America to have not reported a single case of the deadly virus. On Wednesday, Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin said it created a false sense of security that the state's residents were immune to it when in fact, many are old and particularly vulnerable. 'I thought it was just carnage waiting to happen, I wanted to make sure that people understood that they shouldnâ€™t get a false sense of security. 'What we did, they didnâ€™t test. 'Up until a couple days ago we only had 40 tests done, now I think we are at 130 or so, but with that being said, we have no testing, we are not prepared, people think that we are immune from this. 'I thought it was just carnage waiting to happen, I wanted to make sure that people understood that they shouldnâ€™t get a false sense of security. 'When it hits my state â€“ and it has hit â€“ itâ€™s going to be absolutely catastrophic,' he told CNN. The lack of testing has led many experts to say the true number of cases of the virus is far greater than is being reported. There is particular concern for West Virginia because it has a higher population pf elderly and unwell people. A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 51 percent of the population of West Virginia can be considered vulnerable, compared to just 31 percent in Washington DC and 40 percent in New York. In an article for The Atlantic, one army healthcare worker from West Virginia, said the state's healthcare system will be overwhelmed by the coronavirus outbreak. The Surgeon General Jerome Adamssaid that the practical advice for Americans was to stay at home for the next 15 days and avoid social gatherings but it would 'likely' take longer to stunt the spread of the virus. 'If we can get America to pitch in for the next 15 days, we can flatten the curve. 'Fifteen days is likely not going to be enough to get us all the way through, but we need to lean into it now to bend the curve over the next 15 days and at that point we will reassess. 'What you're talking about is our 15 days to stop the spread. 'We want them to avoid gatherings of 10 or more, unnecessary travel, work from home if at all possible. 'When we look at the data, our numbers are where Italy's are two to three weeks ago. 'Do we want to go the way of Italy or do we want to go the way of South Korea and China who were actually able to level off the peak and decrease the numbers,' he said, referring to the two countries' harsh approach which involved people self-containing weeks ago and staying home. Adams said he felt the nation was 'turning a corner' in the amount of people taking the virus seriously. 'We'restarting to turn a corner. People really are [sensing the urgency]. 'I have a 15-year-old son and a 14-year-old son at home. 'They don't care what dad says, even if he is the surgeon general, but by golly do they know that Kevin Durant just got diagnosed with the coronavirus and they're taking it seriously,' he said, referring to the Brooklyn Nets player who, along with three teammates, has the virus. 'Wewant people to understand; chances are you don't have it and chances are if you do have it you will recover.'"
21,"First person to receive experimental coronavirus vaccine says she learned about trial on Facebook, had to sign 45-page waiver and received just over $1000Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126779/First-person-test-coronavirus-vaccine-says-heard-Facebook.html,"The first person to receive the first shotin a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday said that she heard about the trial through a Facebook post. Mom-of-two, Jennifer Haller, 43, of Seattle, Washington, told Refinery 29 that she heard about the vaccine trial about two weeks ago, whenKaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute 'put out a call for volunteers.' 'A friend of mine posted it on Facebook, and I was looking for something to do that could be helpful, so I immediately filled out the survey. The next day I got a phone call to review my health history,' Haller said. 'I passed all those qualifications, and went in the next day to do a physical exam, a blood draw, and get more into my health history. And apparently, it was all good and then I got the call to get the first vaccine' on Monday morning. Before she could get the vaccine, however, she said that she had to sign a 45-page waiver. 'This has never been tested on humans, so thereâ€™s a complete unknown,' she said. Haller said that while the trial is 'offering money,' financial remuneration wasn't the motive behind her volunteering. According to the trial's study volunteer information page, participants will receive $100 per each in-person study visit and those that complete all visitswill be paid a total of $1,100. 'If I was doing it for money like you couldnâ€™t really pay me enough to do this. So itâ€™s just a token, and itâ€™s not really a driver for me at all,' she said. She pointed out that she and her family 'have the resources we need to weather this' and noted that 'I have a deep concern for so many Americans that donâ€™t have the privilege that my family and I have.' Haller, an operations manager at a small tech company, said that while she was able to go to Costco and buy supplies that her family can use over the next few weeks.  'And even that simple act, a lot of people canâ€™t do that,' she said. 'People are losing their jobs, especially in the restaurant industry, the arts community. Itâ€™s devastating, and itâ€™s going to be devastating.' She said that she is also worried about 'the physical health impact for people and also the mental health impact itâ€™s going to have.' Haller said that although her friends 'were definitely concerned' about her signing up for the trial, she said that she 'wasn't scared.' 'My understanding is that itâ€™s similar to what theyâ€™ve done with MERS and SARS, and that the good that can come from it is so much greater than anything that can happen to me, even if it was the worst,' she told Refinery 29. 'Iâ€™m a positive person and I donâ€™t really focus on the potential downsides here. I wasnâ€™t scared. My friends were like, ""You need to be a little more scared about it.""' Haller was among the 45 volunteers who were selected for thepotential COVID-19 vaccine trialat the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle. The injection has been developed in record time after the new virus exploded from China and fanned across the globe. 'We're team coronavirus now,' Kaiser Permanente study leader Dr. Lisa Jackson said on the eve of the experiment. 'Everyone wants to do what they can in this emergency.' Haller received her first vaccine injection on Monday morning. Three others were next in line for a test that will ultimately give 45 volunteers two doses, a month apart. Monday's milestone marked just the beginning of a series of studies in people needed to prove whether the shots are safe and could work. Even if the research goes well, a vaccine would not be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Still, finding a vaccine 'is an urgent public health priority,' Fauci said in a statement Monday. The new study, 'launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.' This vaccine candidate, code-named mRNA-1273, was developed by the NIH and Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Moderna Inc. There is no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they do not contain the coronavirus itself. It is not the only potential vaccine in the pipeline. Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19. Another candidate, made by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is expected to begin its own safety study - in the U.S., China and South Korea - next month. The Seattle experiment got underway days after the World Health Organization declared the new virus outbreak a pandemic because of its rapid global spread, infecting more than 169,000 people and killing more than 6,500. COVID-19 has upended the worldÂ´s social and economic fabric since China first identified the virus in January, with regions shuttering schools and businesses, restricting travel, canceling entertainment and sporting events, and encouraging people to stay away from each other. Starting what scientists call a first-in-humans study is a momentous occasion for scientists, but Jackson described her teamÂ´s mood as 'subdued.' TheyÂ´ve been working round-the-clock readying the research in a part of the U.S. struck early and hard by the virus. Still, 'going from not even knowing that this virus was out there ... to have any vaccine' in testing in about two months is unprecedented, Jackson said. Some of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice. 'We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. ThatÂ´s why weÂ´re doing a trial,' Jackson stressed. 'ItÂ´s not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.' Most of the vaccine research under way globally targets a protein aptly named 'spike' that studs the surface of the new coronavirus and lets it invade human cells. Block that protein and people wonÂ´t get infected. Researchers at the NIH copied the section of the virus' genetic code that contains the instructions for cells to create the spike protein. Moderna encased that 'messenger RNA' into a vaccine. The idea: The body will become a mini-factory, producing some harmless spike protein. When the immune system spots the foreign protein, it will make antibodies to attack and be primed to react quickly if the person later encounters the real virus. That's a much faster way of producing a vaccine than the traditional approach of growing virus in the lab and preparing shots from either killed or weakened versions of it. But because vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, it takes time to test them in large enough numbers to spot an uncommon side effect, cautioned Dr. Nelson Michael of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which is developing a different vaccine candidate. 'The science can go very quickly but, first, do no harm, right?' he told reporters last week. The Seattle research institute is part of a government network of centers that test all kinds of vaccines, and was chosen for the coronavirus vaccine study before COVID-19 began spreading widely in Washington state. Kaiser Permanente screened dozens of people, looking for those who have no chronic health problems and arenÂ´t currently sick. Researchers are not checking whether would-be volunteers already had a mild case of COVID-19 before deciding if they are eligible. If some did, scientists will be able to tell by the number of antibodies in their pre-vaccination blood test and account for that, Jackson said. Participants will be paid $100 for each clinic visit in the study."
22,REVEALED: Food service crew were the primary coronavirus carriers on the doomed Diamond Princess cruise ship and failing to test right away allowed the virus to spread to 700 on board and kill eight,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126961/Food-service-crew-primary-coronavirus-carriers-disaster-Diamond-Princess-cruise-ship.html,"A failure to implement systematic testing for coronavirus among the crew of the Diamond Princess saw crucial days lost as they unwittingly spread the virus across the stricken vessel, DailyMail.com can reveal. Seven hundred passengers and crew were infected and eight died during the novel coronavirus outbreak on the cruise ship last month. Approximately 3,700 on board were quarantined at the Port of Yokohama, Japan for four weeks. Now, a newly published government report, has identified key failings that contributed to the devastating contagion. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Initial Investigation, food service crew members were the primary carriers of the virus across the ship before and, shockingly, after the ship was quarantined. The first coronavirus case detected in a crew member was a food service worker who developed a fever on February 2. Passengers were quarantined on February 3. But despite this and the fact that ship owners were already aware of two earlier cases among passengers the report states, 'Until February 6, no mechanism for systematic testing was implemented,' among crew. Only crew members who self-reported and visited the medical clinic with symptoms were tested. The cruise ship company administered a questionnaire to all crew members on February 3 at which time, according to the report, 'three crew members reported subjective fever.' A second survey just six days later saw 31 crew report a fever â€“ 20 of whom were food service workers. Throughout this time food service crew members continued to carry out their regular duties, delivering food to quarantined passengers in their cabins throughout the ship. In total 15 of the first 20 confirmed cases among crew, were food service workers and the vast majority of other infected staff members were those whose cabins were on deck three - the deck on which food service workers lived. According to the report lessons must be learned if another such contagion is to be avoided or controlled. The CDC concluded that the investigation 'underscores the need for swift epidemiologic investigation as soon as a COVID-19 case is detected in an area of group where a large number of persons gather in a closed or crowded setting (e.g. a cruise ship, music club, health care setting, sports arena, or gymnasium). The report is just the latest critical take on the handling of the coronavirus outbreak on the ill-fated vessel. Cruise ship owners have already been criticized for inadequately disinfecting the ship and mistakenly thinking the threat of infection had dissipated when diagnosed passengers disembarked. The first to develop symptoms on January 23 disembarked two days later before the ship docked at Yokohama. Another, who had become ill on January 22 was still on board when it arrived at the Japanese port on February 3. All symptomatic passengers were tested upon arrival in Yokohama and those who tested positive were disembarked February 4 and 5. All remaining passengers were told to self-quarantine and remain in their cabins for 14 days. But, as this report has now laid bare, the failure to test crew members as the virus spread among them and they continued to carry out their duties on board made a mockery of the edict. Speaking of the Diamond Princess, Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said, 'The quarantine process failed. I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed. People were getting infected on that ship. Something went awry.' "
23,Furious Nets forward Wilson Chandler is BANNED from his own building lobby because his teammates tested positive for coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127497/Nets-forward-Wilson-Chandler-banned-apartment-lobby-teammates-positive-coronavirus-test.html,"It is not publicly known if Brooklyn Nets forward Wilson Chandler is among the team's four players who recently tested positive for coronavirus, but that didn't stop his apartment building manager from kicking him out of the lobby. The 32-year-old Chandler told the story to his Twitter followers on Wednesday - one day after the Nets announced that four players, including injured All-Star Kevin Durant, have tested positive for coronavirus. 'Building manager called me saying ""Oh, I seen Nets players had the virus,""' he wrote on Twitter. '""We would like to know your status. And if you could possibly stay out of the lobby etc. We can't afford to lose our staff.""' 'Didn't even ask was I ok, one,' Chandler continued in a separate tweet. 'And two, she didn't ask me if I had been tested and if it was negative or positive. F*** this building man. I'm going home.' It's not immediately clear where Chandler's offseason home is, although ESPN reported that the aforementioned apartment is in Brooklyn Heights, which sits across the East River from lower Manhattan. Chandler, a native of Michigan, did purchase a home from Denver Broncos defensive end DeMarcus Ware during a previous stint with the Denver Nuggets, according to multiple reports. His Twitter rant accused the building manager of targeting him while ignoring the other foot traffic through the common areas. 'Has to be 300 + plus ppl in this building coming and going,' he wrote. 'Plus Fed Ex and UPs deliveries, Amazon etc. F*** that lady man.' On Tuesday, injured NBA All-Star Kevin Durant and three of his Nets teammates were revealed to have tested positive for coronavirus , joining Utah Jazz stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert as well as Detroit's Christian Wood as the league's only known cases. The club announced the diagnoses on Tuesday afternoon without mentioning any names. Shortly thereafter Durant told Shams Charania of The Athletic that he was among the unidentified players who contracted the virus. 'Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine,' Durant told The Athletic . 'We're going to get through this.' The Nets tested players following a return from flight San Francisco, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. The team paid a private firm to conduct the tests, which came back positive on Tuesday. One player is dealing with aches while others have experienced a few symptoms as well. The team is currently reaching out to those who may have been exposed to the four infected players. 'The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting,' read a team statement on Tuesday."

A variety of brands of baby formula - including the likes ofCow and Gate and Aptamil - are being sold for a huge profit across the sites as mothers across the nation panic about low stocks. On eBay, one seller is flogging Cow and Gate 2 baby milk formula, 800g, for Â£30, while its original retail value on Boots is Â£7.99. But desperate parents have been left with no choice but to fork out, as like many supermarkets across the nation, the website reads: 'We're sorry, this product is temporarily out of stock. Most products are back in stock within two weeks so please keep checking back.' Meanwhile, a pack of 12 Cow and Gate Nutriprem 2, Ready to Use Baby Milk, 200ml, which retails at Â£39.99 on Amazon, is being sold at a starting price of Â£64.65 on eBay. Sellers are even inflating prices on Cow and Gate premature baby milk - designed to help early babies grow - as it's on sale for Â£5.40, rather than the usual price of Â£2.99. And it seems Aptamil 800mg baby milk, which usually retails at Â£10, is in huge demand as it's out of stock everywhere - and is being flogged for Â£28 on eBay. Sarah McCullough, from Northern Ireland, who is a mother-of-two to Lucas, 20 months and Ashton, 10 weeks, told Fabulous: 'It's appalling, especially given the circumstances of so many people out of work and struggling to get by.' She added: 'Babies depend on their formula and for someone to put a mother under pressure to pay out crazy money for their child's survival is absolutely disgusting.' It comes as the shelves of British supermarkets are emptying at pace and staples are being rationed as people stockpile amid the coronavirus outbreak. Shortages previously limited to anti-bacterial hand gel and hand soap have spread to cupboard items such as rice, pasta, couscous, Pot Noodles, bottled water, toilet roll and pet food - as well as chilled items including milk, butter and yoghurt. Pharmacy shelves are also emptying of paracetamol, ibuprofen and immune-system boosting tablets such as Berocca as people prepare to fight off the flu-like illness that has claimed hundreds of lives worldwide. Facebook and Twitter is packed with photographs of empty shelves from major supermarkets across the UK where shoppers appear to have thrown empty boxes into the aisles in the mad scramble for items."

The steep recent plunge in markets â€” with the main indexes down more than 30 percent from last month's peaks â€” has come as investors priced in a complete breakdown in business activity and consumer spending from the coronavirus pandemic. 'We're just in panic mode here,' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.'The fear of, maybe, deflation setting in, is probably one of the reasons why the market is acting the way it is.' It is the latest wild swing in the markets, after Wall Street's worst trading day since 1987 on Monday, and a 1,000-point surge for the Dow on Tuesday. It was the seventh day in a row that the Dow moved at least 1,000 points either up or down. With airports and hotels emptying and airlines asking staff to take unpaid leave to stem losses, the S&P 1500 airlines index sank 16.8 percent, while shares in Hilton, Marriott and Hyatt hotels fell by 20 percent to 30 percent. Trump's request for Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to taxpayers along with $50 billion in loans for airlines did little to stem the bleeding and by noon the Dow and S&P were both down more than 6 percent on the day. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump wants to send checks to Americans in the next two weeks to help support them while more parts of the economy come closer to shutting down. The Federal Reserve has also announced more measures to keep financial markets operating, including another $500 billion liquidity injection announced on Tuesday. Shares in Boeing Co, long a symbol of U.S. tech and industrial power, sank another 15.2 percent and are now down more than 60 percent since the start of the year. 'We're going to have massive disruption and dislocation in our economy,' said Keith Bliss, managing partner at iQ Capital in New York. 'People are conflating what's going on with the coronavirus with what happened in the global financial crisis.' However, investors fear that even dramatic stimulus will not be able to avert a deep recession as the COVID-19 disease continues to spread rapidly across the globe and estimates for the duration of the damage extend out into the summer.  The virus has spread so quickly that its effects havenÂ´t shown up in much U.S. economic data yet. On Tuesday, a report showed retail sales weakened in February, when economists expected a gain. A separate report a day earlier showed manufacturing in the state of New York contracting. 'The global recession is here and now,' S&P Global economists wrote in a report Tuesday. In the latest signs of corporate stress, FedEx Corp slumped 4.2 percent after suspending its 2020 profit outlook and announcing cost cuts. Even Cheerios maker General Mills Inc, which raised its profit forecast citing bulk-buying of its products, fell 6 percent, while the main U.S. airlines dropped between 5.7 percent and 9.3 percent."
26,Prince Harry and Meghan Markle say that efforts to tackle coronavirus are a 'true testament to the human spirit' as they urge the public to 'support' each other in an impassioned Instagram postÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8126735/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-urge-public-support-amid-coronavirus-epidemic.html,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have branded the efforts to tackle the coronavirus epidemic 'as true a testament there is to the human spirit.' Taking to the Sussex Royal Instagram account, the Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 38, shared an inspirational quote alongside a long caption which began:'These are uncertain times. And now, more than ever, we need each other.' 'We need each other for truth, for support, and to feel less alone during a time that can honestly feel quite scary.' As well as urging their 11.7 million-strong following to remain united, they also thanked those working tirelessly around the world to help fight. It comes as a close friend exclusively told DailyMail.com Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are self-isolating in Canada, as Meghan confides in friends that Harry feels 'helpless' and is 'concerned' about the Queen and his father catching coronavirus. It has also been revealed the UK coronavirus infections soared by 676 in a day as the government prepare to reveal the new death toll. The royal's post quickly racked up over 23, 000 likes - with many thanking the royal couple for their supportive words. 'Thank you for those kind, supportive words,' praised one, while a second commented: 'Such a wonderful platform to remind us of the good in the world.' In the post, the couple went on to say how there are many around the world who are in need of support - who are workingto respond to this crisis behind the scenes, on the frontline, or at home. They wrote: 'Our willingness, as a people, to step up in the face of what we are all experiencing with COVID-19 is awe-inspiring. This moment is as true a testament there is to the human spirit. 'We often speak of compassion. All of our lives are in some way affected by this, uniting each of us globally.' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex also revealed thatover the coming weeks they will be posting inspiring stories surrounding coronavirus, in addition to accurate information and facts that we should be aware of. The post concluded: 'We are all in this together, and as a global community we can support each other through this process â€“ and build a digital neighbourhood that feels safe for every one of us.' And royal fans from across the globe have praised Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for the positive use of their platform. 'Harry and Meghan will use their platform for good once again,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'Thanks for your uplifting Post.' 'Now is the time to reach out to everyone regardless of how much we view or feel about each other as the virus is not choosing who to attack. Keep safe everyone.'"
27,"Italy sees 475 new coronavirus deaths - the highest one-day toll of ANY country - and infections shoot up by 4,207, erasing hopes the rate was slowing",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127341/Italy-sees-475-new-coronavirus-deaths-one-day-highest-one-day-toll-country.html,"Italy has recorded the highest one-day official coronavirus death toll since the first case was detected in China late last year. On Wednesday the country reported 475 new deaths from Covid-19, just a day after it looked like Italian coronavirus infections had started to slow. Italy's Civil Protection Agency announced 4,207 new cases of Covid-19 today, bringing the the total up from 31,506 to35,713. Today's news comes amid hopes the Italian lockdown had slowed the spread of the pandemic. The previous record high of 368 deaths was also recorded in Italy, on Sunday. Today's figures mean the number of people in Italy to be infected rests at35,713, of those 4,025 patients have recovered and 2,978 have died. 'The main thing is, do not give up,' Italian National Institute of Health chief Silvio Brusaferro said in a nationally televised press conference. 'It will take a few days before we see the benefits' of containment measures, said Brusaferro. 'We must maintain these measures to see their effect, and above all to protect the most vulnerable.' Italiancoronavirus infections had slowed in recent days after the country took drastic quarantine measures to stop the spread of the pathogen. The number of daily cases in Italy was fairly stagnant at the start of this week, settling down at around 3,500 new patients per day. Tuesday's increase in the overall tally was 12.6 per cent, the second-lowest rate since the virus began spreading in Italy on February 21 - offering hope that the lockdown is bearing fruit even as the death toll rose by 345 to 2,503. Italians have been ordered to stay indoors, with schools and universities shut, shops closed except for grocery stores and pharmacies, and heavy restrictions on travel. Italy will rush 10,000 student doctors into service, scrapping their final exams, in an effort to help the struggling health service cope with the coronavirus. University Minister Gaetano Manfredi said the government would let this year's medicine graduates start work some eight or nine months ahead of schedule and waive the mandatory exams they normally sit before qualifying. 'This means immediately releasing into the National Health System the energy of about 10,000 doctors, which is fundamental to dealing with the shortage that our country is suffering,' he said in a statement. The graduates will be sent to work in general practitioners' clinics and at old peoples' homes, freeing up more experienced colleagues who will be sent to the rapidly filling hospitals. Over three weeks, 1,135 people have needed intensive care in Lombardy, the northern region hardest hit. The region has only 800 intensive care beds, according to Giacomo Grasselli, head of the intensive care unit at Milanâ€™s Policlinico hospital. Authorities have been working to set up hundreds of intensive care beds in a specially created facility in the Fiera Milano exhibition center, but are still waiting for sufficient respirators and qualified personnel. Experts warn that there is a lag time between health measures being taken and their effects becoming conspicuous. That suggests the Italian lockdown imposed last week could now be starting to have a noticeable impact. Infectious disease and computer experts at the University of Genoa estimate the new daily infection cases will peak in Italy between March 23 and March 25. Italy's lockdown is due to end on march 25, although schools and public institutions are set to remain closed until at least April 3. 'Reaching the peak doesn't mean you're in the clear,' University of Genoa professor Giorgio Sestili cautioned. 'It only means that the epidemic has started to slow down and that - a few days later - you will have reached the saturation point of intensive care cases.' The number of new infections in the last four days has been fairly stagnant with 3,497 on Saturday, 3,590 on Sunday, 3,233 on Monday and 3,526 on Tuesday. The percentage increase in cases has been below 20 per cent for the last few days, falling to 12.6 per cent yesterday. The signs of a slowing infection rate will be a relief to doctors on the front line ofItaly's coronavirusoutbreak, who have described 'catastrophic' scenes in hospitals which are creaking with the sheer volume of cases. A new Oxford University study suggests that Italy may be particularly vulnerablebecause it has such an old population and the elderly come into frequent contact with the young. Italy's population is the second-oldest in the world, behind only Japan. Oxford researchers said it was common for young adults in rural areas to live with their parents and grandparents but to commute into cities, such as Milan, to work and socialise. Young people may have been picking up the virus while travelling and brought it home without realising they were ill, the Oxford researchers said. The study is another warning to Britain, which has an ageing population. Older people are known to be more likely to die of Covid-19 if they are infected with the virus. A couple caught having sex in a car were arrested for breaching coronavirus quarantine rules in Italy. The 23-year-old Egyptian man and 40-year-old Tunisian woman were caught in the act by a police officer on the outskirts of Milan on Monday. Quite apart from decency laws, the pair chose a particularly bad time for their roadside fling, with authorities on alert for breaches of the virus lockdown. The pair were accused of ignoring a quarantine rule which bans two people from being in the front or back of a vehicle together, according to news agency ANSA. It is not clear whether the couple will face further action, but authorities have been keeping a wary eye on all road vehicles in order to enforce a ban on travel. Italians are only allowed outside to buy food, give or receive medical care, or travel to work if absolutely necessary. Despite the ample opportunities for indoor entertainment, the couple were caught in the act on a road in Mecenate near Milan which has been heavily hit by the outbreak. Doctors in Italy have told of critically ill patients who should be in intensive care but are instead slumped in busy wards because of a woeful lack of equipment and staff. Worryingly, the doctors who have spoken out are from state-of-the-art hospitals which typically provide excellent care but were caught flat-footed by the virus which is stretching their capacity to breaking point. Medics are struggling to keep pace with the escalating number of cases, including those treating patients at the advancedPapa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in the wealthy city ofBergamo in the virus-plagued Lombardy region. The 950-bed hospital has been brought to its knees because of the crisis, with more than 400 of the beds used by coronavirus patients and three of the hospital's four most senior staff off sick. Intensive care specialist Mirco Nacoti told theWall Street Journal: 'Until three weeks ago, we did everything for every patient. 'Now we have to choose which patients to put in intensive care. This is catastrophic.' The hospital's once rapid emergency response is also at breaking point, with even people reporting heart attacks waiting an hour on the phone because the lines are being bombarded. DrAngelo Giupponi, who coordinates Papa Giovanni's emergency response, said his team takes 2,500 calls daily and brings 1,500 to hospital. Signalling the team were caught off-guard by the epidemic, he said that ambulance staff have not been trained for such a contagion, and revealed many have become infected after their vehicles became contaminated. Dispatcher Diego Bianco, a 40-something with no underlying health conditions, even died. In a sign that Rome is scrambling to react to the outbreak, Dr Sergio Cattaneo said he has seen unused wards outfitted into an intensive care unit in six days. He also claims a hospital laundry room was converted into a giant stretcher-filled waiting room and a tented field hospital erected outside to test possible new virus patients. Dr Cattaneo, head of anesthesiology and intensive care at the public hospital in Brescia in northern Italy, said: 'What is really shocking - something we had not been able to forecast and brought us to our knees - is the quickness the epidemic spreads. 'If the spreading of this epidemic is not put under control, it will bring all hospitals to their knees.' Dr Cattaneo's new ICU added six more beds to the hospital's capacity, bringing to 42 the number of ICU beds dedicated to the virus. Across the Lombardy region, local authorities are pushing ahead with plans to build a 400-bed ICU field hospital at the Milan fairgrounds, even though the civil protection agency has warned that it doesn't have the ventilators or personnel to staff it, and that time is running out. 'The secret has been - and this should be a strong message for foreign countries - to act early on this, in order to avoid - like in our case - having to chase after it day after day,' Cattaneo said. Brescia, an industrial city of nearly 200,000 east of Milan and the capital of a province of 1.2million, is second only to nearby Bergamo in positive cases in Lombardy, the epicenter of the pandemic in Europe. For the past two days, Brescia actually outpaced Bergamo in the number of new infections, on Tuesday adding another 382 positive tests for a total of 3,300 and suggesting that it is becoming Lombardy's hottest hot spot. Indeed, seven of Brescia's deaths this week were among residents of the same nursing home in Barbariga, where another eight elderly people tested positive, local media reported. While many people suffer relatively mild symptoms from the virus, the mortality rate in Italy in people over 80 is 22 percent, according to statistics from the National Institutes of Health. It has been a race against time for Lombardy to add more ICU beds than the patients who need them, not an easy task given that 10 percent of all Italy's infected require ICU admission, primarily for respiratory help. Nearly all admitted patients have interstitial pneumonia, a disease in which the lace-like tissue of the lungs' alveoli become inflamed, leading to progressive respiratory failure, according to Giovanna Perone, director of Brescia's emergency services. 'In the last few days, the number of people arriving here on their own and reporting such symptoms has increased,' Perone said outside the civil protection tents where walk-in patients are tested and then sent to the hospital's converted laundry room to await the results. The onslaught of infections has completely overwhelmed the public health system in Italy's prosperous north, prompting regional officials to beg retired doctors to come back to work and to accelerate graduation dates for nurses and specialists. 'I ask you from my heart, we need your competency, your experience, your efficiency,' said Giulio Gallera, Lombardy's chief healthcare official. 'Give us a hand.' The 25 billion euro aid package the Italian government approved Monday, aimed at bolstering both the health care system and helping businesses, workers and families weather the economic hit, also contains provisions to hire 10,000 more medical personnel. Already Lombardy this week has received 2,200 responses to a 'help wanted' sign on its Facebook page, and hired over 1,000 people, Gallera said. Italy's medical personnel also complain about critical shortages of gear, including protective masks and glasses. Italy's national federations of doctors and nurses issued a joint alarm Tuesday over the more than 2,300 medical personnel who have been infected, 1,900 of them doctors and nurses."
28,Trump CLOSES border with Canada to 'non-essential traffic' and says it is by 'mutual consent' claiming it will NOT affect trade,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126289/Donald-Trump-CLOSES-border-Canada-non-essential-traffic.html,"Donald Trump closed the northern U.S. border with Canada Wednesday, tweeting that 'non-essential' traffic would be banned. 'We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!' he tweeted. How the ban will work and exactly when it takes effect was not immediately clear. The move came afterCanada and the United States had worked out the details of a mutual ban on non-essential travel between the two countries amid the new coronavirus pandemic. Both countries are hoping to choke off the spread of the virus but also eager to continue the critical economic relationship. Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of its exports. Truck drivers and Canadian snowbirds, who live in the U.S. for part of the year, are among those expected to get an exemption. Completely closing the border would cause severe economic damage to both the U.S. and Canada as the two economies are integrated. Much of CanadaÂ´s food supply comes from or via the U.S. and and 98 percent of its oil exports go to the U.S. About 18 percent of American exports go to Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday he would close the country's borders to anyone not a citizen, an American or a permanent resident â€“ and even they have to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival - due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trudeau said an exemption for Americans, despite the rapid rise of cases in the U.S., would be due to 'the level of integration of our two economies.' Trudeau himself went into self-isolation after his wifeGregoire Trudeau tested positive for the virus. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the border is vital to the daily life to people on both sides. 'Nearly 200,000 people cross that border every day and that border and that traffic that goes across that border is literally a lifeline for both the Canadians and the Americans on both sides of that border,'' Freeland said. 'We get our groceries thanks to truckers who drive back and forth across that border,' she said. 'Very urgently needed medical supplies and medicines go back and forth across that border. And essential workers go back and forth across that border every day. So it is a unique relationship for Canada and it's important for us in handling our situation on the border to be sure that we act to get things right.'' But many in Canada criticized the decision to give Americans an exemption. British Columbia Health Minister Adrian Dix said he vehemently disagreed with the American exemption given the surge in cases in neighboring Washington State. Trump has heralded the decision to shut off travel with China following the outbreak as critical to stemming the outbreak, even as U.S. cases have surged and deaths hit the 100-person landmark. Last week he announced the shut off of travel from Europe amid the outbreak there, later adding the U.K. to the list. The administration is now focused on measures to try to cut down on movements of people within the U.S. borders to try to slow the spread of the virus. The U.S. had surpassed 6,500 cases based on Johns Hopkins University data as of Wednesday. Canada, with its smaller population, was just shy of 600."
29,Defensive Trump claims he always treated what he calls â€˜the Chinese virusâ€™ seriously as he's engulfed by healthcare shortages and economic crisisÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126795/Defensive-Donald-Trump-claims-treated-Chinese-virus-seriously.html,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his claim he has 'always' treated the coronavirus seriously and then pivoted to complaining about last month's impeachment inquiry, demanding to know 'where's the whistleblower.' The president spent the morning tweeting on a variety of subjects, including his response to the coronavirus epidemic, opined on the Democratic presidential primary and complained about impeachment. His defensive posture comes as his administration asked Congress to allocate $500 billion for two direct payments to Americans - one in April; one in May - to counter the economic affects of the coronavirus. The White House is also requesting $300 billion to help small businesses and $50 billion for the airline industry, according to Treasury Department documents being circulated. The details were released after Treasury SecretarySteven Mnuchinwarned lawmakers on Tuesday that the unemployment rate in American could drop to 20 per cent. Mnuchin met with Republican senators at the Capitol Tuesday afternoon where he posed risks the economy could face if a coronavirus stimulus package is not passed quickly, Bloomberg News reported. But Mnuchin's office pushed back on the report. 'During the meeting with Senate Republicans today, Secretary Mnuchin used several mathematical examples for illustrative purposes, but he never implied this would be the case,' Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley said in a statement. The administration is also facing questions about whether the United States has enough hospital beds and supplies to treat those infected with the coronavirus. A 100-page government document, issued Friday and reported on by The New York Times, warned thepandemic will last 18 months or more, could come in several waves and cause critical shortages of medicines, equipment, and staff. 'Shortages of products may occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure,' the plan warned. 'This includes potentially critical shortages of diagnostics, medical supplies (including PPE and pharmaceuticals), and staffing in some locations.' P.P.E. refers to personal protective equipment. In his Wednesday morning tweet flurry, President Trump touted his approval rating, which he claims is 53 per cent but it was 44 per cent in the latest Gallup poll and sits at 44 per cent in the RealClearPoliticsaverage. Trump argued his rating is 'not bad considering I get nothing but Fake & Corrupt News, day and night. 'Russia, Russia, Russia', then 'the Ukraine Scam (where's the Whistleblower?)', the 'Impeachment Hoax', and more, more, more.' The president regularly complains that news reports he doesn't like are 'fake news.' During the impeachment inquiry, Trump demanded that the whistleblower, who revealed the details of Trump's phone call with Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky, which then sparked the impeachment process, testify in the inquiry. Trump was impeached on two articles in the House but cleared in the Senate trial. It's not the first time Trump has tweeted about politics as the United States battles the pandemic. He's been critical of governors who have criticized his administration's response to the virus and he has blamed the Obama administration for the lack of testing kits. He said Tuesday he has the right to defend himself and would continue to do so when he saw something on the news he didn't agree with. 'I only do that when I have to respond,' he said of his politically-themed tweets. 'I will continue to do that if they're not going to play fair. Because, you know, they have the media on their side; I don't. I just have me,' he said about Democrats. 'I want it to be bipartisan and nobody's going to be better than me,' the president said during a briefing in the White House press room. 'But when they attack me or these incredible people behind me - I'm not going to let them get away with that. I can't do that.' The president on Wednesday also pushedback at reports his response to the pandemic has taken on a more serious tone in recent days, again calling it the 'China virus,' a term some find racially insensitive. 'I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the 'borders' from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!,' Trump wrote. President. Trump has been criticized for minimizing the disease in its early days but told reporters on Tuesday he's 'always' taken it seriously. 'I've always known this is a real - this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,' he said during a press briefing on the virus. Last month, on Feb. 26, the president down played the effects of the virus. 'We're going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we've had very good luck,' he said. "
30,Think only old people can die from coronavirus? Think again. Expert who led team assessing China's outbreak says NO ONE is safe from the killer virusÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124901/Young-people-dying-coronavirus-despite-elderly-people-worst-affected.html,"Elderly people are the most at-risk of developing severe coronavirus, but experts warn young, healthy people are still dying from the respiratory infection. Globally, more than 200,000 people in around 170 countrieshave been infected with COVID-19 since the outbreak began in China in December. Most of the 8,000 fatalities recorded across the world have been people who are elderly or suffer underlying conditions, and have weakened immune systems. ButBruce Aylward, who assessed the pandemic inChina,said there are an alarming number of young people who have developed complications from the disease. Dr Aylward, of the World Health Organization, has already warned people as young as 30 were dying from the life-threatening virus. Meanwhile, an emergency doctor in Belgium has revealed the shocking lung scans of 'young, healthy people',which he described as 'nothing short of terrifying'. Chinese health officials carried out the biggest ever study on the never-before-seen strain of the virus, using data from 72,000 cases. They found 19 per cent of patients who died were below the age of 60 years. Chinese health officials carried out the biggest ever study on the never-before-seen strain of the virus, using data from 72,000 cases. Results showed the SARS-CoV-2 virus posed the greatest threat to older patients and those with underlying conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. It also revealed the exact breakdown of the cases that had been confirmed. AGE 0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+ CASES (%) 416 (0.9%) 549 (1.2%) 3,619 (8.1%) 7,600 (17.0%) 8,571 (19.2%) 10,008 (22.4%) 8,583 (19.2%) 3,918 (8.8%) 1,408 (3.2%) And what about deaths? AGE 0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+ DEATHS (%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.1%) 7 (0.7%) 18 (1.8%) 38 (3.7%) 130 (12.7%) 309 (30.2%) 312 (30.5%) 208 (20.3%) When the body is faced with a new infection, it builds an immune response that can be activated the next time they become infected. With a new virus such as that which causes COVID-19, nobody has the antibodies needed to fight it. This means anyone can get sick, even if they may appear healthy or go through every winter without being affected by flu or the common cold. 'I would emphasise that there were a lot of people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, who were dying as well,' Dr Aylward said at a conference earlier this month. 'People who did have co-morbid conditions had a much higher ratio of dying from the disease, but in most people there were no other predictors, apart from age, that they could die.' Emergency doctor Ignace Demeyer, on the frontline in Belgium, also warned no one is exempt from catching the virus. Speaking to Belgian broadcaster VRT, Dr Demeyer said they have few elder patients, and more of those aged between 30 and 50 who are â€˜terribly affected by the virusâ€™. ""They all have the same complaints,â€™ he said. ""They have been sick for a week, stayed home with the flu. The flu attack is over, they think. They feel fine for two days. And then they report with complaints of a dry cough and shortness of breath.â€™ Investigations reveal the patientâ€™s blood oxygen levels are very low for their age. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease which can leave some in need of oxygen ventilators. Dr Demeyer also showed recent scans of a coronavirus patient â€“ representing â€˜sporty, young peopleâ€™ â€“ which are â€˜nothing short of terrifyingâ€™. The first scan shows normal, healthy lungs. The second shows air sacs in the lungs filled with inflammatory fluid, which is visibly worse in the third image. 'Those people can of course still heal, but it is a life-threatening situation. And they are people who do not smoke, they have no other condition such as diabetes or heart failure. They are sporty young people,â€™ Dr Demeyer said. A 21-year-old Spanish football coach has died of coronavirus after doctors also diagnosed him with leukaemia, it was reported Monday. Francisco Garcia, who managed the junior team of Malaga-based club Atletico Portada Alta, was rushed to hospital with severe symptoms of the virus. But when he arrived doctors also identified the deadly blood cancer. They said he would have survived if he was not suffering from the pre-existing condition. Mr Garcia is believed to be the youngest victim of coronavirus in Europe. Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported the death, stating that his leukaemia was not detected until he was taken to hospital with coronavirus symptoms. The University of Technology's respiratory infectious diseases expert, Brian Oliver, argued deaths in young people tended to be higher in China than the rest of the globe. 'What happened in China doesn't seem to be playing out in quite the same way elsewhere. In terms of younger people being susceptible, it seemed to be happening a lot more in China but not so much elsewhere and I don't quite understand that,' he said. He described the coronavirus â€“ as with any newly diagnosed infection â€“ as a 'little like a lottery'. 'Because we haven't had these infections before, how our body responds to it is completely unknown... There's always going to be people who have no apparent risk factors and do very badly.' China, Italy and Iran have experienced the highest mortality rates, recording around 7,000 deaths between them. But other parts of Europe, particularly Germany, France and Spain, as well as the US and South Korea, have experienced an exponential hike in cases in recent days. Emergency doctor Ignace Demeyer, on the frontline in Belgium, also warned no one is exempt from catching the virus. Speaking to Belgian broadcaster VRT, Dr Demeyer said they have few elder patients, and more of those aged between 30 and 50 who are â€˜terribly affected by the virusâ€™. ""They all have the same complaints,â€™ he said. 'They have been sick for a week, stayed home with the flu. The flu attack is over, they think. They feel fine for two days.

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease which can leave some in need of oxygen ventilators. Experts fear the UK and Australia are currently two weeks behind most of the globe regarding the coronavirus pandemic â€“ meaning it is likely cases have not yet peaked. There are currently fewer than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK and 71 patients are known to have died. However, health officials fear the true number of cases could be around 70,000 currently. In the UK, a 45-year-old is the youngest known victim. The father-of-two was named as Craig Ruston. He lived in Kettering, Northamptonshire, and had motor neurone disease. Europe's youngest coronavirus was reported to be a 21-year-old football coach in Spain, who had no idea he was vulnerable because of his leukaemia. Francisco Garcia, who managed the junior team of Malaga-based Atletico Portada Alta, was rushed to hospital with severe symptoms of the virus. A study by Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, on more than 72,300 coronavirus patients, is one of the largest to break down death rates in different age brackets. It showed that people aged 10-49 years old had a less than one per cent risk of death. This jumped to 1.3 per cent in those over 50. Outcomes worsened in older patients â€“ the mortality rate was almost 15 per cent in those over 80 years old. Similar data from other seriously affected countries, including Italy, Iran and Spain, are yet to emerge. Fatality rates have proven to vary broadly across the 170 countries affected, ranging from four per cent in China, to almost double that in Italy. However, those figures are based on the number of confirmed cases reported. The mortality rate generally is estimated to be much lower at around one per cent because not all cases of COVID-19 are officially reported. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
31,All 30 MLB teams pledge $1million each for stadium workers amid suspension - but will that be enough if coronavirus pandemic lasts 18 months as federal officials predict?,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124823/MLB-teams-pledge-1M-stadium-workers.html,"While the federal government is warning that the coronavirus pandemic could last as long as 18 months, all 30 Major League Baseball teams have pledged $1 million each to aid workers who are losing paychecks amid the season's indefinite suspension. Last week, MLB canceled the remaining spring training games and announced that the start of the regular season would be pushed back two weeks, to mid-April. However, as the pandemic spread, MLB revised its timetable on Monday, stating that no games would be played for at least eight weeks. That means Opening Day will occur no earlier than mid-May. If the season winds up being reduced from 162 games, the move would be costly for stadium workers, who are paid per event. The extent of the losses remain unknown as a 100-page federal warning predicted a potential 18-month pandemic, which would wipe out the upcoming baseball season entirely. MLB's statement did not mention the potential for an 18-month pandemic. 'Over the past 48 hours, I have been approached by representatives of all 30 clubs to help assist the thousands of ballpark employees affected by the delay in the start of the Major League Baseball season,' MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. 'Motivated by desire to help some of the most valuable members of the baseball community, each Club has committed $1 million. The individual clubs will be announcing more details surrounding this support effort in their local communities. The timing of these announcements will vary because of the need to coordinate with state and local laws as well as collective bargaining obligations in an effort to maximize the benefits realized by each group of employees. 'I am proud that our clubs came together so quickly and uniformly to support these individuals who provide so much to the game we love.' MLB grossed a record $10.7 billion in revenue last season, according to Forbes, but the league's lucrative media contracts could be effected by the current season suspension. 'It just speaks volumes about how even though we're adversaries and even though we compete between the white lines, when something like this pops up, we rally around,' Arizona Diamondbacks manager Tony Lovullo said on a conference call with reporters. 'It's a way for us to come together and support everybody that's effected by this. I think it's a pretty loud statement that Major League Baseball made by showing that kind of support.'"
32,"Texas man, 23, is ARRESTED for lying about testing positive for coronavirus in social media post which also falsely claimed the virus had gone airborne -Â  sparking panic that jammed hospital phone linesÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127039/Texas-man-ARRESTED-lied-social-media-post-testing-positive-coronavirus.html,"A Texas man has been arrested after he lied about having coronavirus in a social media post. Michael Lane Brandin, 23, said in a Facebook post that he tested positive at Tyler County Hospital on Friday. The post now appears to have been removed. 'In a comment on the post, Brandin advised that he was informed by medical professionals in Tyler County that the virus had become airborne,' police said in a statement. It caused panic on phone lines for both the hospital and authorities. Multiple people contacted the Tyler County Sheriff's Office about the claim someone in their county had been stricken with the contagious illness. It was as the COVID-19 pandemic reached new heights last week and states started moves to close down public places as the number of infections and related deaths rapidly increased across the country. Police got in touch with the man who lives in Woodville, East Texas on Tuesday. After County Judge Jacques Blanchette issued an arrest warrant,Brandin turned himself to police later that day. He was jailed on $1,000 bond. He received a class A misdemeanor charge of false alarm or report. He has claimed he was conducting a social experiment when he shared a post claiming to have COVID-19. 'Brandin advised deputies his post was to make a point that you cannot believe everything you view online,' cops said. Tyler County District Attorney Lucas Babin believes the man did it for attention. 'Knowingly communicating, initiating, or circulating a false report/false alarm of COVID-19 that one *knows is false or baseless*, and that would ordinarily cause action by an official or interrupt the occupation of any place of assembly, can be a criminal offense in the State of Texas,' The Tyler County District Attorney's Office posted Monday. 'Texas Penal Code 42.06 - False alarm or report states a person commits an offense if the person knowingly communicates a report of an emergency that he knows is false or baseless and that would ordinarily cause action by an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies.' It comes as medical professions panic they may be infected with the virus and could risk infecting others. One ER physician in San Francisco, Rosny Daniel, shared in a Medium post this weekend that he feels wracked with guilt over possibly infecting patients or colleagues. Amid the pandemic many nursing homes risk running out of protective masks and gowns by next week because of the new coronavirus, and at least one facility already had to resort to using plastic garbage bags to make gowns, an industry group warned Wednesday. Texas saw its first coronavirus death Sunday - a man in his late 90s. As of Monday nightrestaurants and bars closed as the state said no more than 50 people should gather in a space.

33,Chinese doctor in Wuhan claims he made breakthrough in coronavirus pandemic with stem cell injections - having 100% success rate after treating nine mostly elderly patients,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8116881/Doctor-claims-breakthrough-stem-cell-injections-treat-coronavirus.html,"A Chinese doctor who runs a lab in Wuhan - ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic - claims he could save thousands of lives after making a breakthrough in the treatment of the deadly pathogen, DailyMailTV can reveal. Dr. Dongcheng Wu, an expert in stem cell therapy, said he has successfully treated nine patients who were hospitalised with novel coronavirus pneumonia. The patients, mostly elderly, had developed serious breathing issues as well as overwhelming inflammation in their lungs before they volunteered for Dr. Wu's medical trial earlier this month in Wuhan. Alongside conventional treatment, Dr. Wu infused Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) directly into all nine patients' veins. It's claimed they all made a complete recovery within days of receiving the treatment. News of the breakthrough only reached Dr. Wu, who is partnered with American stem cell company Blue Horizon International (BHI), early last week. The new virus, called COVID-19,is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms including a sore throat, headache, fever, cough or trouble breathing. Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure. In an exclusive interview, the scientist told DailyMailTV: 'This treatment could potentially save thousands upon thousands of lives, so naturally we are very happy with these results. 'Yes, it is a cure, but it is still very early in the process and we still have work to do. 'We need to finish the clinical trials to confirm whether the stem cell therapy is safe andefficacy to treat novel coronavirus pneumonia.' Stem cells, often dubbed the building blocks of life, are cells that have the ability to develop into different cell types. They can also help repair damaged tissue. Scientists can take stem cells from adult tissue such as bone marrow but the most controversial type are embryonic stem cells, which come from human embryos. Dr. Wu and BHI only use stem cells taken from the umbilical cord placenta, which is considered throw away tissue. Dr. Brian Mehling, co-founder of BHI, is working closely with Dr. Wu on the research and said the results of the medical trials are 'astounding'. 'As the coronavirus outbreak unraveled, coincidentally it started in Wuhan, China which is where our stem cell labs have been for over a decade,' he explained. 'A lot of people were coming down with severe pulmonary pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis and ultimately they were dying. 'But it's not the viral load that kills them it's the pulmonary complications that develop, just like influenza. 'So our research found that stem cells are extremely effective in decreasing inflammation and also enabling the body to repair damaged tissue. 'So we thought what the heck, let's give it a shot. We gave nine patients, who were in hospital with severe, acute pulmonary dysfunction, we gave them core blood stem cells via IV and 100 percent of them got better, so of course we were astounded.' Stem cells, often dubbed the building blocks of life, are cells that have the ability to develop into different cell types. They can also help repair damaged tissue. Scientists can take stem cells from adult tissue such as bone marrow but the most controversial type are embryonic stem cells, which come from human embryos. Stem cells are also takenfrom the umbilical cord placenta, which is considered throw away tissue. Stem cell research was much hyped a decade ago as the miracle cure for degenerative diseases, like Parkinson's. But things turned sour when the therapy became mired in controversy over the use of stem cells derived from the fetuses of aborted babies. Embryonic stem cells quickly became a divisive and highly-politicized issue in the U.S. Dr. Wu and Dr. Mehling said that since their breakthrough the Chinese Government has approved and fast tracked clinical trials for the treatment. And Dr. Wu's company, Wuhan Hamilton Biotechnology-Co.,LTD, has already received more than $5 million Chinese Yuan ($715,000) in government funding to begin research protocols, with more money expected to come in. Dr. Wu is Chief Science Officer for New York-based BHI, which he is working with to seek the approval needed for clinical trials in the U.S. Sadly, the scientist said it could take months before the treatment officially hits the mass market in China or the U.S. The breakthrough, however, could bring about a sea change in how coronavirus is tackled in the future and is a sign of hope for the most vulnerable. Right now there is no known effective treatment in clinical practice. Coronavirus brings about mild flu-like symptoms in most people, but for the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions, it can be deadly. Speaking to the effectiveness of the treatment, Dr. Wu said: 'It seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of cells and repair the function of the lung. 'UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly protect lung tissue from virus-induced acute lung injuries.' The UC-MSCs are manufactured by Dr. Wu's company at a lab in Wuhan and comply with the requirements of China's medical gold standard - Volume â…¢ of the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (2015 Edition). The doctor says his product has also passed the quality test of China's National Institutes of Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) and his firm is currently the only stem cell institution in the Hubei province. BHI is moving quickly to seek the necessary Food and Drug Administration approvals in the U.S. Dr. Mehling says they have submitted the retrospective study data to an investigational review board (IRB) and once the study receives a rubber stamp, a research paper will be written for publication. His firm is also submitting a FDA protocol and applying for a study which they believe will be approved quickly due to the severe nature of the crisis. Dr. Mehling said because his company has spent 10 years researching stem cell therapy, a treatment which he says is already 'proven' and 'tested', he believes their coronavirus treatment will be 'ready to deploy' sooner rather than later. Dr. Mehling, an orthopedic surgeon, said his firm is also about to publish a long-term safety study on stem cell therapy in which 30 patients received multiple doses over a seven to eight year period with no significant complications. BHI already has two approved clinical trials for UC-MSCs treating osteoarthritis and diabetic nephropathy. Dr. Wu said he has 400 doses of stem cells stockpiled in Wuhan and another 400 could be manufactured within three weeks to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. BHI, which has offices in Europe and the Caribbean, also has plans in place for international expansion to make the coronavirus treatment available to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. With the right infrastructure and supply chain in place, the company will also be able to roll out treatment for dozens of other conditions around the world. But former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and former commissioner of the New York Health Department, Dr Tom Frieden, told DailyMail.com that the CDC will need 'clear evidence' that any coronavirus treatment works. 'The priority now is to learn as much as possible about this virus and what works to stop it,' he said. 'This will include randomized controlled trials of potential treatments, some of which may be effective. 'Until we have clear evidence that any treatment works, and the means to deliver it to those who need it, we need to focus on what we can do now: wash our hands frequently, cover our coughs, not go out if sick, stop shaking hands, and practice social distancing. 'Health care facilities should focus on surging safely by improving infection control, doubling or tripling intensive care capacity, and preparing to deal with large numbers of less severely ill patients and worried well, for example through screening outside in tents.' Dr Frieden is president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global nonprofit initiative and part of the global nonprofit Vital Strategies. Serial science and technology entrepreneur Nova Spirack, who operates a coronavirus information site with a team of doctors and medical experts called germinfo.com, says the new treatment could be 'great' if it passes FDA protocols, but warns that it likely won't be widely available for at least a year. 'Even if they find it working clinically and they have permission to test it on human volunteers, at this stage, if they wanted to go through FDA approval, it will take a year at least,' he explained. 'A lot is happening with stem cell treatments so this doesn't surprise me. 'It looks to be a very promising direction and there's a number of trials in process. 'There are a relatively small number of patients that have been treated so it's early days, but it's a very astonishing direction.' Spirack, a philanthropist and futurist, does note that while any new treatment will miss the window to treat anyone infected in the first wave of the coronavirus, it will be available for what he predicts will be second and third waves of the disease. Dr. Wu is a professor at Wuhan University School of Basic Medical Science, Chu Tian Scholar, and Director of the Stem Cell Centre, Hongqiao Brain Hospital The first cases of novel coronavirus were reported in Wuhan late last year, and until recently, China has borne the brunt of the outbreak. Almost three quarters of the more than 110,000 or so confirmed global cases are in mainland China and more than 3,000 people have died as a result of the virus, with the majority in Hubei province. The Chinese government has placed hundreds of millions of people under lockdown, while others have been unable to return to work due to travel restrictions. Stem cell research was much hyped a decade ago as the miracle cure for degenerative diseases, like Parkinson's. But things turned sour when the therapy became mired in controversy over the use of stem cells derived from the fetuses of aborted babies. Embryonic stem cells quickly became a divisive and highly-politicized issue in the U.S. The biomedical industry relied on the malleable cells for groundbreaking research, but their use raised serious questions of morality and ethics. Today, however, the technology has moved on. Still, Dr. Mehling said stem cell research gets an incredibly bad rap because of misinformation. 'There's a huge biggest misconception about stem cells that has been perpetuated, a lot of people think that stem cells are involved with fetal embryonic tissue, like aborted babies, that's just not the case,' he said. 'That's something that's happened in the past but it's not something happening now at the forefront of stem cell medicine. 'Fortunately today you don't need embryonic or fetal cells to get useful stem cell lines to treat all these different diseases, so the technology has advanced to the point where it's just not necessary to use those sources of stem cells.' Dr. Mehling explained that the stem cells are instead taken from the placenta cord tissue of healthy babies. Another source is the patient themselves. Many experts in the field blame the pharmaceutical lobby for hindering the advancement of stem cell research in the U.S. The pharma giants realized that developing a miracle cure for dozens of serious conditions could seriously dent their revenues, for the simple reason that millions of patients would no longer be reliant on expensive medication.

34,"PIERS MORGAN: If coronavirus killed young people like it does the old, we would have shut down society weeks ago - so the least dumb, selfish millennials like Vanessa Hudgens can do is stop partying and like, wake the f*ck up",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125813/PIERS-MORGAN-Selfish-millennials-help-coronavirus-kill-people.html,"Iâ€™ve wondered for a long time how the millennial generation would cope with a real crisis. Not one of the myriad crises many of them claim to have every second of every day, triggering the biggest explosion of â€˜anxietyâ€™ and â€˜triggeringâ€™ the planet has ever seen. No, a real one. One that impacts every one of us, one that causes genuine hardship and strife, one that causes huge numbers of deaths and rips the global economy to pieces and, one that is a proper valid reason to feel anxious because itâ€™s indisputably frightening and none of us, not even the worldâ€™s top scientific experts, knows how bad it will get before we come out the other side. Well, now I donâ€™t have to wonder because itâ€™s happening. And whilst some millennials are being perfectly stoic and sensible, recognizing the gravity of the situation, some are behaving like complete and utter cretins. I couldnâ€™t believe the idiocy of so many Spring Break students flocking to the beach in Florida, hugging and kissing each other like it was VE-Day. Or the crass stupidity of all those flocking to bars on St Patrickâ€™s Day around Britain and America yesterday, when even Ireland shut down every pub in the country and cancelled all the parades beloved by every town in the country. Or all the blinkered arrogance of all the cocky young chumps bombarding me with â€˜Stop being so f*cking hysterical, itâ€™s just the flu!â€™ abuse on Twitter every time I try to warn them of how bad this pandemic may get, and how urgent it is that they take it more seriously. What kind of mentality, I pondered, makes people so brainless when the weâ€™re in the grip of the greatest potential threat to our existence since World War 2? For the answer, turn to High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens, 31. Yesterday, she turned on her Instagram live â€˜storyâ€™ and broadcast her thoughts on the coronavirus to her 38.4 million followers, many of them young and impressionable. Reacting to the news that the virus may still be wreaking havoc through the summer, she said: â€˜â€™Til July sounds like a bunch of bullsh*t. Iâ€™m sorry, but like, itâ€™s a virus, I get it, I respect it. But at the same time, like, even if everybody gets it, like, yeah, people are gonna die. Which is terrible, but like inevitable? I donâ€™t know. Maybe I shouldnâ€™t be doing this right now.â€™ You, like, THINK? As understandable outrage greeted this staggeringly tone-deaf response, Hudgens dug an even bigger hole by deciding to further clarify her position. Naturally, this involved blaming everyone else for all misinterpreting her disgustingly callous jabberings, and immediately positioning herself as a victim to try to draw the sting out of the vitriol pouring down on her stupefyingly dumb head. â€˜Hey guys,â€™ she whimpered, flicking her hands through her frizzy hair like a ditzy dimwit, â€˜so yesterday I did an Instagram Live and I realized today that some of my comments are being taken out of context. Itâ€™s a crazy time, itâ€™s a CRAZY time and I am at home and in lockdown, and thatâ€™s what I hope you guys are doing too, in full quarantine. And staying safe and sane. Yeah, I donâ€™t take this situation lightly. By any means. I am home.â€™ Then Hudgens gave the obligatory millennial vacuous smile and peace sign to the camera and concluded: â€˜So stay inside, yâ€™all.â€™ Unsurprisingly, this disingenuous load of self-protective crap did little to dampen the furore. So, an hour later, her publicist presumably took charge and ordered Hudgens to issue a grovelling new mea culpa statement saying: â€˜Iâ€™m so sorry for the way I have offended anyone and everyone who has seen the clip from my Instagram live yesterday. I realize my words were insensitive and not at all appropriate for the situation our country and the world are in right now. This has been a huge wake up call about the significance my words have, now more than ever. Iâ€™m sending safe wishes to everyone to stay safe and healthy during this crazy time.â€™ In the general scheme of things right now, the thoughts of someone like Vanessa Hudgens shouldnâ€™t matter. But when someone with 38.4 million followers who hang on her every word is spewing such dangerous nonsense, it actually does matter. It can literally mean people live or die. And her casual, self-absorbed gormlessness explains why all those Spring Break students are partying on the beach, why so many others are still hitting any bars and club still open in Britain and America, and why theyâ€™re so furious at their holidays being cancelled, or their gyms being closed, or their favorite sport being canned. This is a woefully entitled generation thatâ€™s grown up whining about absolutely everything - yet has so little to legitimately whine about given how much safer, healthier, less war-ravaged and more prosperous the world is now compared to any other time in recorded history. They mock and scorn the â€˜Boomersâ€™ (people born between 1946 and 1964 â€“ I donâ€™t quite qualify, having been born in 1965, but this doesnâ€™t stop them calling me one) for being old, out-of-touch, boring and narrow-minded. But one thing my generation knows is the horror of World War 2 because our grandparents who lived through it told us about it. My own grandmother was in her late teens when WW2 started, and I had many conversations with her about what life was like for young people during that tumultuous period. She said it was very very tough, obviously, but it also taught everyone to be strong, resilient, selfless and caring. â€˜We were all in the same boat,â€™ she said. â€˜So, everyone helped each other. We had no choice.â€™ It also taught that generation perspective. Millions of young men had to go and fight for the country, and many didnâ€™t come back. Today, the biggest sacrifice weâ€™re being asked to make is not go to the pub or beach and sit at home for a while watching TV. Is that really too much to ask? The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasnâ€™t enforced measures as draconian as most other countries because he doesnâ€™t think weâ€™d have the patience to stay inside for months on end. In other words, we donâ€™t have the stomach for the fight. I find that notion offensive, and his worryingly vague strategy of half-social-distancing very wrong â€“ perhaps disastrously so - but sadly heâ€™s probably right about many millennials judging by the ludicrous antics of people like Vanessa Hudgens. Fortunately, there are some people of her generation who DO get it. Take pop superstar Ariana Grande, who four days ago tweeted the following message to her 72 million followers: â€˜I keep hearing from a surprising amount of people statements like â€œthis isnâ€™t a big dealâ€, â€œweâ€™ll be fineâ€, â€œwe still have to go about our livesâ€, and itâ€™s really blowing my mind. I understand that is how it felt weeks ago but please read about whatâ€™s going on, please donâ€™t turn a blind eye. It is incredibly dangerous and selfish to take this situation lightly. The â€œwe will be fine because weâ€™re youngâ€ mindset is putting people who arenâ€™t young and/or healthy in a lot of danger. You sound stupid and privileged and you need to care about others.. like, now.â€™ Ariana added: â€˜Like, your hip hop yoga class can f*cking wait, I promise. This a national emergency and a pandemic of global proportions.â€™ Heroes come in many forms at moments such as this, but Ariana Grande is a true hero for grasping the severity of this situation and taking action to properly inform her massive army of young fans as to what the right response should be. We need a lot more Arianas on hugely influential social media right now and a lot fewer Vanessas. This Coronavirus crisis is a war and everyone needs to grow the f*ck up and understand just how serious it is. Especially those young people who still donâ€™t get it. To them, I can only say that every one of your parents and grandparents is incredibly relieved this is a virus that predominantly kills members of our age-groups and not that of our kids. But if it WAS the other way round then I can assure you we wouldnâ€™t be taking a single reckless chance with YOUR lives. So, stop taking a chance with the lives of those older and more vulnerable than you. Itâ€™s time many millennials stopped being so bloody selfish and asked themselves the question President John F. Kennedy asked in his 1961 inaugural address: â€˜And so my fellow Americans,â€™ he said, â€˜Ask not what your country can do for you - but what you can do for your country.â€™ Before itâ€™s, like, too late yâ€™all."
35,Surgeon General says 15 days of lockdown 'won't be enough' to stop coronavirus spread and pleads with Americans to 'pitch in' and stay indoors NOW or risk 'going the way of Italy'Â Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125711/Surgeon-General-says-longer-15-days-self-isolation-slow-coronavirus-spread.html,"The Surgeon General warned on Wednesday that it could take longer than 15 days to slow the spread of coronavirus but that Americans must 'pitch in' and do their part now to stay home and self-isolate if they want the deadly disease to die. Jerome Adams appeared on Today to make the plea, a day after President Trump issued a 15-day set of guidelines to people to work from home where possible and practice social distancing. Millions have heeded the advice and are avoiding going out. Some, like in cities where the pandemic spreading the quickest, are calling for harsher action, like a two-week national shutdown to force people indoors. On Tuesday, startling new data revealed that as many as 2million Americans may die if no further action is taken but that making people self-isolate now for 18 months could cut that figure to 200,000. There has not been a clear cut answer on how long Americans will have to continue living in this current state of crisis. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the current state of crisis could last nine months, whereas experts overseas say it could even longer. On Wednesday morning, Adams said that the practical advice for Americans was to stay at home for the next 15 days and avoid social gatherings but it would 'likely' take longer to stunt the spread of the virus. 'If we can get America to pitch in for the next 15 days, we can flatten the curve. 'Fifteen days is likely not going to be enough to get us all the way through, but we need to lean into it now to bend the curve over the next 15 days and at that point we will reassess. 'What you're talking about is our 15 days to stop the spread. Scroll down for video 'We want them to avoid gatherings of 10 or more, unnecessary travel, work from home if at all possible. 'When we look at the data, our numbers are where Italy's are two to three weeks ago. 'Do we want to go the way of Italy or do we want to go the way of South Korea and China who were actually able to level off the peak and decrease the numbers,' he said, referring to the two countries' harsh approach which involved people self-containing weeks ago and staying home. Adams said he felt the nation was 'turning a corner' in the amount of people taking the virus seriously. 'We'restarting to turn a corner. People really are [sensing the urgency]. 'I have a 15-year-old son and a 14-year-old son at home. 'They don't care what dad says, even if he is the surgeon general, but by golly do they know that Kevin Durant just got diagnosed with the coronavirus and they're taking it seriously,' he said, referring to the Brooklyn Nets player who, along with three teammates, has the virus. 'Wewant people to understand; chances are you don't have it and chances are if you do have it you will recover. 'But what we don't want to do is to have you or anyone elseout there spreading it,' he said. There are more than 7,000 cases of coronavirus in the US right now and 121 people have died. In Italy, which went into self-isolation a week ago, 31,000 people are infected and more than 2,600 have died. South Korea was able to flatten the curve of the virus spread and has now seen a downward trend in new cases for the fourth day in a row due to harsh and early rules that people must stay inside. President Trump on Wednesday referred to the illness as the 'Chinese Virus' and said he'd done a 'very good job from the beginning' by closing the country's borders to China. 'I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the borders form China - against the wishes of almost all. 'Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!' he tweeted. His reference to it as the 'Chinese Virus' has incensed healthcare professionals and members of the public, let alone Chinese dignitaries. In the worst-hit cities and states like New York, officials are now contemplating a 'shelter in place' order to try to stunt the spread of the virus. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that he was 'almost' at the stage of recommending a 'shelter in place' order to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. De Blasio needs Cuomo to agree to it before he can issue it in New York City, where cases are growing faster than anywhere else in the country. Bars, restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and casinos in the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland are all now closed. In San Francisco, people have been told to go into lockdown for three weeks, avoiding all non-essential travel our outings. Trump on Tuesday announced a stimulus plan that would involve sending Americans checks for $1,000 each to try to help them through the economic hardship the virus is sending them towards. The country is being dragged into a recession, with unemployment skyrocketing as non-essential trades drop by the wayside. Already, people in service based industries are losing work and are already fearing how they will pay their bills. There is also a tremendous strain on the healthcare industry. Doctors and nurses are worried about how soon the virus will peak and how intensely it is going to peak. They are also reporting a shortage in essential medical supplies like face masks and gloves and - crucially - ventilators. The most frightening symptom of the virus is how it affects people's breathing. Those who have recovered from it or are recovering from it say they can barely breath. There is a woeful shortage of ventilators in the world as a result of it. President Trump said he was sourcing more but it is unclear where he plans to get them from. The other logistical problem is the shortage of hospital beds. More than 2 million Americans could die of coronavirus if the US does NOTHING - but keeping people apart could cut fatalities to 200,000, study suggests Social distancing of the entire US population, isolation of anyone infected with coronavirus and quarantines for their household members may be the only way to stem the pandemic - and these measures may need to be in place for 18 months, a new study suggests. Researchers at Imperial College London say that if the whole population doesn't hunker down, between 1.1 million and 1.2 million Americans will likely die of coronavirus, even if they are treated. Their study, published Monday, predicts how the coronavirus pandemic is likely to pan out, depending on how the US and UK respond. If the US and UK did nothing, they estimate that 81 percent of each population would become infected, and 2.2 million Americans would die, along with 510,000 Britons. But keeping people away from each other could cut US deaths down to some 200,000, Mother Jones estimated. So far, more than 100 Americans have died since the coronavirus emerged in China in December. The study's alarming findings underscore just how imperative following new US guidelines to stay out of bars and restaurants and not gather in groups of more than 10 for the next two weeks (at least) are to saving millions of lives. The Trump administration's new guidelines - which followed a temporary moratorium on visits to nursing and retirement home facilities - were issued only for 15 days after their Monday announcement, but the Imperial College study suggests far longer efforts may be needed. Even Trump himself drastically changed his tone and told Americans the pandemic may last in the US until July or August. According to their assessment, Imperial College experts believe social contact may well need to be minimized until a vaccine is widely available - up to 18 months from now. They examined the impact of two strategies - mitigation and suppression - on the spread of the virus. They also analyzed the effects of different levels of suppression tactics on the same. In short: mitigation is not enough, and any country that can should practice suppression. The main distinction between the two tactics is who should be practicing them. Mitigation policies would mean 'combining home isolation for suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect case and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of the disease,' the study authors wrote. To be sure, this would help, cutting the number of deaths by about half and alleviating two-thirds of the strain on health care systems. But under those conditions, hundreds of thousands of people in the US and UK alike would likely die in the pandemic, and ICU beds would be overwhelmed by many time over. That leaves suppression. If 'suppression' sounds rather Draconian, that's because it requires measures that are rather strict. They're the kinds of restrictions on movement already being suggested - although not mandated - in the US: Closing down businesses venues that are social in nature, such as movie theaters, bars and restaurants and generally keeping people apart. Fueling all of these measures is a goal of a transmission rate below one, meaning that each infected person passes coronavirus on to less than one other person on average."
36,San Francisco professor is slammed for posting a picture of the Chinese flag with an image of coronavirus along with a stamp saying 'made in China',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126953/Musician-slammed-posting-picture-Chinese-flag-image-coronavirus.html,"A San Francisco-based professor has been slammed by people and authorities in China after sharing a picture depicting the country's flag with an image of the coronavirus. The flag also bore the word 'coronavirus' and a stamp reading 'made in China'. Shanghai-born professor Liu Yunjie, also known as Jay Liu, called the image 'very appropriate' after one friend questioned the decency of his post on Facebook, according to a report. He replied in Chinese: '[The purpose] is to let the whole world know. Otherwise, they will shift the blame to America.' Professor Liu's Facebook account is now restricted for viewing, but the controversial post was captured by Beijing Daily, which reported the outcry yesterday. The news comes as Beijing and Washington lock horns in a new diplomatic row after US President Trump called the coronavirus 'the Chinese virus' three times despite official warnings from China. It also comes as one of Prof Liu's friends, American-Chinese violinist Jiang Yiwen, was sacked by a Chinese college after referring to Chinese people as 'pigs' in a social media reply to Prof Liu. Liu is the Professor of Viola at San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He also serves as the Associate Principal at San Francisco Symphony. His original Facebook post shows a modified version of the Five-star Red Flag, which is the national flag of China. In the picture, the biggest of the five stars, which stands for the Communist Party, was replaced by an image representing the coronavirus. Four Chinese characters, translated as 'made in China', appeared next to the illustration of the virus. Underneath the stars, the word 'Coronavirus' and a stamp reading 'made in China' were laid out. The musician's post sparked an outcry among Chinese social media users, who labelled him as an 'er gui zi', a derogatory expression for someone who betrays their own country. On Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, one typical comment warned 'don't you come back' while another person wrote 'er gui zi are most hateful'. The League of Chinese Orchestras, an organisation affiliated to the Chinese Musician Association, condemned Prof Liu's behaviour, calling it 'unappropriated'. In a statement yesterday, the authority criticised him for 'defaming and humiliating' the Chinese flag. MailOnline has reached out to Prof Liu and San Francisco Symphony for comments on the matter. President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his use of the term 'China virus' to describe the coronavirus, saying 'it's not racist at all.' The president, repeatedly this week, has talked about the 'China virus,' a moniker that has been called racist. China expelled journalists from three major American news outlet in the wake of Trump's words. Trump, who started his Wednesday briefing by saying he had 'important developments in our war against the Chinese virus,' told reporters at the White House he used the description because the virus originated in Wuhan province of China. 'It's not racist at all. It comes from China, that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,' he said during a press briefing. 'I have a great love for all the people from our country, but as you know, China tried to say at one point that - maybe they've stopped now - that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen. It's not going to happen. Not as long as I'm president. It comes from China,' he said. Early Tuesday Beijing demanded 'the U.S. side correct the mistake immediately and halt its groundless accusations' An American-Chinese violinist has been fired by a music college in China after referring to Chinese people as 'pigs'. Jiang Yiwen made the comment while replying to a post from San Francisco-based viola professor Liu Yunjie on popular messaging app WeChat. They were discussing a video interview regarding the American government's policies towards the American Chinese, according to Chinese state media Global Times. He used a pig emoji to represent people from mainland China. Jiang reported wrote: 'It is said those [pig emoji] inside the wall cannot watch it.' He was referring to the people living on the Chinese mainland, whose internet freedom was restricted by Beijing's so-called Great Fire Wall. Jiang's Chinese employer, The Tianjin Juilliard School, labelled Jiang's remarks as 'evil'. The institute said in a statement today that it had dismissed Jiang with immediate effect. Jiang also teaches at Montclair State University and The Bard College Conservatory of Music, according to the Bard College's website."
37,"Coronavirus pandemic will last 18 months or more, could come in waves and cause critical shortage of medical supplies, 100-page federal plan warns",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125051/Coronavirus-pandemic-18-months-100-page-federal-plan-warns.html,"The coronavirus pandemic will last 18 months or more, could come in several waves and cause critical shortages of medicines, equipment, and staff, the government has been warned. A 100-page document, issued Friday as Donald Trump announced a state of emergency, says Washington should close schools and cancel public events to curb the spread of the virus. The missive also urges the President to invoke Korean War-era powers to force industries to respond to the crisis by ramping up production of key items. Activating the Defense Production Act would force companies to accept and prioritize government contracts for items including ventilators, protective gear for medical workers, medicines and diagnostic tools such as testing kits, the plans says. The document, a copy of which was seen by the New York Times, also warns that state and local government resources will be stretched and less reliable as the crisis goes on. 'These stresses may also increase the challenges of getting updated messages and coordinating guidance to these jurisdictions directly,' it says. On Monday Trump urged Americans to avoid public gatherings of 10 or more people, but stopped short of a federally-enforced ban. While individual states have shuttered schools and universities, there has been no order from Washington to do so yet. And Trump has also avoided invoking the Defense Production Act, despite widespread problems with testing that has been blamed on a lack of kits. Asked Tuesday about invoking the act, Trump said: 'Weâ€™re able to do that if we have to. Right now, we havenâ€™t had to, but itâ€™s certainly ready. 'Weâ€™ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we donâ€™t need it. Itâ€™s a big step.' As of Wednesday morning there were almost 6,500 confirmed coronavirus infections in the US - more than double the 2,300 cases reported on Friday when the plan was issued. Deaths have also climbed above 100, more than double the 48 reported Friday. What the plan does not address is the economic impact of the crisis, which is being felt across the globe as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warned that a recession has already begun. Mnuchin told senators in a Tuesday briefing that he believes the economic fallout from the coronavirus is potentially worse than the 2008 financial crisis, Bloomberg reports. He then said that the virus could drive up the unemployment rate to 20 per cent, a level not seen since 1935. Mnuchin lawmakers don't provide a swift financial response to wage workers and small- and medium-sized businesses to alleviate the problems. A Treasury Department spokeswoman later denied that Mnuchin was making predictions, and was giving examples of what might happen if no action is taken. 'Secretary Mnuchin used several mathematical examples for illustrative purposes, but he never implied this would be the case'. Regardless, economists for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley say that a global recession has likely already begun, with the only question remaining how severe the pullback will be, and how long it will last. 'We expect the recession to be front-loaded, with a recovery in [the second half of the year],' said Goldman Sachs' chief economist in a note to clients. 'This assumes that infections will slow significantly by the end of April as the lockdowns and other mitigation measures bear fruit.' Late Tuesday West Virginia also confirmed its first case of coronavirus, meaning all 50 states have now reported at least one case. Meanwhile seven million Californians have been ordered to shelter in place, countless 'non-essential' businesses have been effectively shuttered and more cities - including in New York - are considering ordering similar measures. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has confirmed that the number of coronavirus cases in the Big Apple has surged to 923 with 10 deaths. 'This is moving very fast. We should all be very concerned about how we find a way to slow down the trajectory of this virus,' de Blasio said. 'The idea of shelter in place now has to be considered.' For the next two weeks, the Trump administration has asked that all Americans practice social distancing, which means avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people. Although it falls short of an order, the new guidelines ask that anyone with even mild symptoms stay home for those two weeks in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus. Experts have widely agreed that the US as a whole has surpassed a tipping point in the coronavirus pandemic, and now the infection has spread to all 50 states in the US. As cases surged last week, Trump declared a national state of emergency and Tuesday announced additional measures to expand testing. Now, all US state scan make, validate and use their own tests rather than wait for the FDA's approval. The president also announced that telemedicine must now be covered at no additional costs to publicly insured Americans in an effort to lighten the burden on health care systems and reduce social contact and coronavirus transmission. Still, testing has lagged woefully in the US. As of Tuesday afternoon, less than 50,000 Americans had been tested for the infection, while South Korea and Italy are testing thousands of people per day. Health and state officials have widely blamed the testing shortage for the steep rise in US cases, saying it both delayed public knowledge of just how many cases there were and allowed the disease to continue to spread from unwitting carriers to their families, social contacts and health care workers. The Pentagon is also stepping in to aid the coronavirus outbreak, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper saying the military would donate up to 5 million respirators to hospitals, with 1 million being made available immediately. Esper said the military also would donate 2,000 ventilators held in reserve, as part of the scramble to get U.S. hospitals staffed and outfitted for an anticipated crush of victims of the coronavirus. Ventilators have become an acute issue, with only about 62,000 in use and others in stockpile, but an anticipated need that is far greater. The military normally keeps respirators on hand to protect troops from whatever they might encounter on the battlefield. Some of the respirators are intended for 'single-use,' Esper said. In the case of ventilators, training would be required, with the military available to step in to teach civilians on their use. Officials have struggled to get the critical equipment on-line, and it requires technical aptitude to properly monitor patients experiencing breathing issues or lung failure. "
38,Princess Beatrice's royal wedding plans on hold over coronavirus: Buckingham Palace cancels reception,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126727/Princess-Beatrices-royal-wedding-plans-hold-coronavirus.html,"Princess Beatrice has put her royal wedding plans with fiancÃ© Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi for May 29 on hold over thecoronaviruspandemic. The couple were due to marry at St James's Palace in London, before Beatrice's grandmother the Queen hosted a private reception in Buckingham Palace's gardens. But royal officials revealed today that this reception has been cancelled - and the couple could now host a private marriage with a 'small group of family and friends'. Some 150 guests had been due at the ceremony for the wedding of Beatrice - Prince Andrew's eldest daughter - which was set to be one of the social events of 2020. London-born millionaire property tycoon Mr Mapelli Mozzi, 37, has dual British and Italian citizenship. Italy - the worst-hit European country by the virus - is in lockdown. Buckingham Palace said the couple were aware of the need to avoid taking any unnecessary risks and had reviewed their plans in light of government advice. The wedding day has now been changed after the Government advised Britons to avoid social gatherings to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Beatrice, 31, who is ninth-in-line to the throne and a cousin of Princes William and Harry, became engaged to Mr Mozzi in Italy last September. It continues a torrid six months for Beatrice, whose father Prince Andrew stepped down from his royal duties in the wake of a car crash BBC interview last November. Andrew was grilled over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, but he has vehemently denied sleeping with a 17-year-old who claims she was forced to have sex with him. It also comes after Beatrice's Harry and his wife Meghan caused fury when they announced that they would step down as senior royals on March 31. Beatrice's sister Princess Eugenie married wine merchant Jack Brooksbank at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in October 2018 on a star-studded day. But Beatrice's wedding was always set to be a much more private affair than the wedding of her younger sister - and could now be a far smaller occasion too. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said today: 'Princess Beatrice and Mr Mapelli Mozzi are very much looking forward to getting married but are equally aware of the need to avoid undertaking any unnecessary risks in the current circumstances.' 'In line with government advice for the UK and beyond, the couple are reviewing their arrangements for May 29. 'They are particularly conscious of government advice in relation to both the wellbeing of older family members and large gatherings of people. Therefore, the planned reception in the Buckingham Palace Gardens will not take place. 'The couple will carefully consider government advice before deciding whether a private marriage might take place amongst a small group of family and friends.' The Queen was seen today at a private audience at Buckingham Palace for her last official engagement before decamping to Windsor for weeks of self-isolation. The 93-year-old greeted Captain Angus Essenhigh, the new Commanding Officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth, and his predecessor Commodore Steven Moorhouse. There were bows from the captain and the commodore but no handshakes as they met and spoke with the monarch in the audience room of the Queen's London home. Tomorrow, the Queen will decamp to Windsor Castle, her Berkshire royal residence, as she socially distances herself amid the coronavirus pandemic hitting the UK. The Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace have also been called off and the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party in Edinburgh in July is now under review. The monarch will be based at her favourite home with a reduced household and will be following appropriate advice, a source said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on all people in the UK, particularly the over 70s, to avoid all non-essential contact and travel to control the spread of the virus. Elizabeth II is due to celebrate her 94th birthday next month, and the risk of more severe symptoms from the coronavirus is greater for the elderly. She is not the only royal affected by the Government's new advice. Heir to the throne the Prince of Wales is 71 and the Duchess of Cornwall is 72. Other working royals include the Queen's cousins the Duke of Gloucester, 75, the Duke of Kent, 84, and Princess Alexandra, 83. The Duke of Edinburgh, 98, has already been spending most of his time in the sanctuary of Wood Farm, a cottage on the Sandringham estate. The palace said further announcements would be made on Trooping the Colour, the 75th anniversary of VE Day and a state visit by the Emperor and Empress of Japan. Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masakois are due to stay with the Queen at Windsor Castle in May, but the high-profile occasion is expected to be postponed. Meanwhile schools in Scotland and Wales are set to close in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with those in England widely expected to follow suit. The Welsh Government said all schools will close for an early Easter break by Friday at the latest, while Scotland said schools will also close by the end of the week. In other developments, athird patient in Scotland diagnosed with Covid-19 has died and the FTSE 100 continued its downward slump with a 5 per cent fall this morning. In Norfolk, ababy has tested positive for Covid-19 at the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, the second reported UK case among infants. The youngest person to die in the UK to date is Craig Ruston, 45, who had motor neurone disease and died after his chest infection was diagnosed as coronavirus. Meanwhile filming on EastEnders and BBC Studios dramas including Casualty, Doctors, Holby City, Pobol y Cwm and River City was postponed until further notice. AndSainsbury's became the latest supermarket to announce measures to help the elderly and vulnerable as store shelves became severely depleted. In further developments, pubs and restaurants were told they will be allowed to be turned into takeaways to help provide food for people in self-isolation. And global confirmed cases of coronavirus have topped 200,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. There have been 104 deaths in the UK."
39,"As if the coronavirus crisis wasn't bad enough, Salt Lake City gets hit by its biggest earthquake in 28 YEARS, leaving 55,000 homes without power and very few workers prepared to help rebuild",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126313/5-7-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-Salt-Lake-City-biggest-one-strike-28-YEARS.html,"A5.7-magnitude earthquake shook the Salt Lake City area early Wednesday, knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes, shutting down the city's airport and bringing the light rail system to a halt. The epicenter was just southwest of Salt Lake City and an estimated 2.76million residents likely felt the quake, the US Geological Survey reported. Residents reported feeling shaking across a 100-mile area, with the heaviest impact in Salt Lake County, officials said. Some residents ran from their homes and into the streets as they felt the earthquake shake buildings for 10 to 15 seconds. Scroll down for video People reported feeling the quake in the neighboring states of Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming and Nevada. There were no reports of injuries, but the tremor knocked power to nearly 55,000 homes and businesses, said utility Rocky Mountain Power. Property damage was reported at Rescue Mission of Salt Lake City, where a wall collapsed, sparking an evacuation, reported KTVX. The USGS reported said the earthquake hit at 7.09am about 2.5 miles north of Magna, a township in Salt Lake County located about 10 miles away from Salt Lake City, at a depth of 6 miles. 'From what we have been able to determine, it doesn't appear this was major shaking,' Utah's Division of Emergency Management tweeted after the seismological event. At least six aftershocks were recorded in the immediate aftermath of the main quake, and more were expected throughout the day. The quake damaged the Angel Moroni statue atop Salt Lake Temple, the Mormon Church's largest, knocking a trumpet from the angel's hand. A church spokesman also said some of the temple's smaller spire stones were displaced, according to the Deseret News. In Herriman, just south of the capital Salt Lake City, bricks from the facade of the Silver Crest Elementary School fell in front of the main entrance. Cracks appeared in the brick facade of a Salt Lake City bank building, and rubble appeared on the sidewalk in front of an unoccupied building under construction, social media images showed. Area residents have been sharing videos on Twitter showing the impact of the temblor, which knocked pictured off the walls and dishes from shelves. One recording shows a child having breakfast in her high chair when the quake strikes, visibly shaking the room. 'Oh, my gosh!' her mother exclaims in the background as the girl pauses her meal with a frightened look on her face. Another Twitter user shared a video showing the chandelier in his dining room swinging to and fro during the seismic event. 'Just felt my first earthquake,' Dave Noriega wrote. 'That was crazy.' A social media user from Magna, which was the site of the epicenter, shared on Instagram dramatic photos of household items scattered all over the house after the earthquake. One photo shows a flat-screen TV resting on the floor. Another image shows broken crockery littering the kitchen, along with canned good that had flown out of cabinets. This is Utah's most powerful earthquake since 1992, when a magnitude 5.9 quake rattled the area of St. George. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall addressed the earthquake in a morning tweet, writing: 'I know the last thing we need right now is an earthquake, but here we are, and it sounds like aftershocks are likely.' Operations at the Salt Lake International Airport came to a halt and the control tower and concourses were evacuated, the airport tweeted. Officials were conducting a runway inspection to try to determine if there was any damage, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. Planes headed to Salt Lake City were diverted. The FAA's Salt Lake Air Route Traffic Control Center, which is housed separately from the airport control tower, is handling all air traffic in the area, the agency said. Salt Lake City is the 23rd busiest U.S. airport and a hub for Delta Air Lines. The quake also shut down the light rail service for Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Authorities said older buildings may have suffered structural damage though they did not expect to find severe damage in most structures, said Utah Emergency Management spokesman Joe Dougherty. 'WeÂ´re hearing of lights falling down, bookcases falling down, we've heard of water lines breaking inside of buildings,' Dougherty said. He recommended that people check on their neighbors, but that advice that could be challenging when people are being told to say inside their homes to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 'This is the time for people to really do the right thing, make sure everyone is taken care of,' Dougherty said. 'But we still do need to remember we have a pandemic going on at the same time.' Utah Gov. Gary Herbert urged residents to stay away from downtown Salt Lake City while work crews assessed the damage from the quake. Herbert also said the state's poison control center at the University of Utah in the capital Salt Lake City was evacuated while officials assessed the damage, and he said the coronavirus hotline was down. The Utah Department of Health said it set up a temporary hotline for information about the coronavirus. Amid the virus outbreak, the governor reminded people to stay home or telecommute, unless they are essential employees, or work in public safety. As of Wednesday morning, there were 51 confirmed cases of the deadly COVID-19 virus in Utah, and 7,898 cases nationwide."
40,NYC's iconic Naked Cowboy ignores the coronavirus to entertain an almost empty Times Square - but does add a mask to his barely-there attire,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127577/NYCs-iconic-Naked-Cowboy-ignores-coronavirus-entertain-near-Times-Square-mask.html,"New York City's iconic busker The Naked Cowboy was seen ignoring concerns over the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday to carry on entertaining an almost empty Times Square. It was business as usual for the performer, except for him being a little less naked - having added a protective face mask to his signature barely-there attire. The Naked Cowboy, aka Robert John Burck, was pictured wearing the mask while posing for a photo with a fan on Tuesday. Neither Burck nor the woman - who wasn't wearing a mask - seemed too concerned about social distancing as the half-naked performer picked her up in his arms. The Ohio native has been drawing in the crowds for more than two decades with his iconic outfit choice of cowboy hat, boots and tiny white briefs with 'Naked cowboy' painted on. He started out busking in1997 at Venice Beach, California, before moving to his regular spot in Times Square the following year. Come rain or shine, 365 days a year, the busker braves the elements to sing and play guitar and is now one of New York's biggest tourist attractions. And he is clearly not about to let a little thing like a global pandemic stand in the way of him performing. However, it's unlikely he will be drawing in big crowds for some time, as New York officials rolled out new measures this week to try to slow the spread of coronavirus. The city that never sleeps turned into a ghost town on Monday night as all cafe, bars, restaurants and movie theaters shuttered from 8pm, after officials ordered the ban in a desperate effort to slow thespread of coronavirus. Under New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio executive order, the normally lively bars and restaurants are now restricted to take-out and delivery only for 'as long as necessary' along with casinos, gyms and movie theaters. The usually bustling Times Square has been almost deserted of tourists and residents as establishments shut up shop for the foreseeable future and people were told to practice social distancing. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo insisted Wednesday that the city will not go into total lockdown, but introduced a new order that employers keep 50 per cent of their workers at home. He also announced that a hospital ship, The Comfort, will be sent to New York City to help the cope with the rising number of cases. As of Wednesday morning, 2,382 people had tested positive in New York State, up more than 800 since Tuesday. In New York City cases went up from 814 on Tuesday to 1,339 people testing positive by Wednesday."
41,WHO admits it never offered the US coronavirus test kits in the early days of the outbreak - but the CDC never asked and usually has 'sufficient domestic capacity' for diagnostics,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8126657/CDC-never-discussed-providing-coronavirus-testing-kits.html,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) never discussed providing coronavirus testing kits to the US in the early days of the outbreak. By the end of February, the WHO had shipped hundreds of thousands of test kits around the world - but the US was not among them. Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson for the WHO, told DailyMail.com that no discussions occurred between the UN health agency and the CDC about providing tests to the US - nor did the WHO offer to send tests. 'This is consistent with experience since the US does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity,' he said in a statement. The WHO published guidelines on January 17 for any nation that was planning to manufacture tests for the virus. However, the CDC told media on the same day that it had chosen to develop its own version of the test. The CDC shipped its first batch of kits to laboratories across the US on February 5. According to CNN, the WHO announced the next day that it had shipped 250,000 kits to at least 70 countries. Less that a week later, several state labs said the CDC diagnostic was returning 'inconclusive results.' This forced the federal health agency to remanufacture components of the kit, although its unclear what defect occurred. Ever since the CDC started to address this issue, delays have continued. As of Wednesday, just 4,255 specimens have been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19 at CDC labs, according to the CDC's website. However, this does not include tests conducted at US public health laboratories, commercial laboratories and some hospitals. Meanwhile, there have beenno reports of delays from countries that received testing kits from the WHO. South Korea, by comparison, has tested more than 270,000 people - about 700 times as many people as the US has. It's unclear whether using the WHO's protocol would have delayed testing the US. There was also plenty of red tape for US public health labs in all 50 states to be granted authorization to test for coronavirus, which didn't occur until March 9. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN that looking back, the US should have had a backup, but defended the CDC's tests. 'If you look back and Monday morning quarterback it would have been nice to have had a backup,' Dr Fauci said. 'But what the CDC has done over many, many years when we have things like this is to develop their own test, which is always really a good test, and to roll it out in a way...where they give it to departments of public health.' Worldwide, more than 208,000 people have been infected and more than 8,300 have died. In the US, there are more than 7,300 cases have been confirmed in all 50 states and more than 100 people have died."
42,California rents RVs to protect the homeless and installs outdoor handwashing stations during coronavirus outbreak,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125825/California-rents-RVs-hotel-rooms-protect-homeless-coronavirus-outbreak.html,"Los Angeles' homeless population could find themselves self-isolating inside a beachside RV in the coming months - asCalifornia frees up hundreds of motorhomes and hotel rooms for those in need. Holidaymakers have been asked to leave and others warned to avoid the area surrounding Dockweiler Beech RV site in the city of El Segundo, California, amid preparation for the growing Coronavirus pandemic. Hand washing stations have popped up in Los Angeles and San Francisco around large homeless populations and Governor Gavin Newsom revealed the state is acquiring around 900 hotels with tens of thousands of rooms to be converted for the use of both hospital patients and the homeless. In the next few weeks, dozens of camper vans parked along the beach front are expected to become home to vagrants ordered into quarantine. California boasts a homeless population of more than 100,000 and with no way for them to wash their hands or maintain hygiene, it was a highly at-risk group - diseases already run rife with central LA's Skid Row recently seeing outbreaks of typhus and Hepatitis A. At least 400 people have tested positive for the virus in the state so far, but numbers are rising and many more are yet to be tested. Those who used to live at the RV park were handed a notice last Friday, according to Fox News 11, to tell them their reservations were being canceled 'due to the need for emergency shelter related to the COVID-19 virus'. A Los Angeles County spokesman revealed the area surrounding the RVs should be avoided 'until further notice' as it was being converted into a shelter for people suspected of carrying the COVID-19 virus. 'LA County will work with private sector providers, faith-based groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs) and government partners to support those in isolation or quarantine with comprehensive services to ensure their safety, health and well-being,' they added. 'Supportive housing facilities will be distributed across all areas of the County to limit disruptions as much as possible. 'This is an emergency action that Los Angeles County is taking to comply with the Department of Public Health's orders to keep the entire County safe.' Photographs show dozens of Four Winds RVs lining the coastal area in preparation for an expected rise in the need for emergency accommodation.The state is also acquiring two vacant hospitals to beef up capacity as it faces the possibility of a surge in the number of hospital patients. It comes as it was revealed 'few, if any' California schools will reopen before summer break, Gov. Newsom said Tuesday as he provided a stark assessment of the implications from the spreading coronavirus that threatens to overwhelm the state's hospitals and drain its spending reserves. While urging Californians to stay united and promising 'we will get back to the life that we have lived,' Newsom also acknowledged much is unknown and so the state is preparing for frightening worst-case scenarios. He put the California National Guard on alert for duties that include humanitarian missions like ensuring proper food distribution and public safety as some grocery stores resorted to rationing to control panic buying. The virus is affecting every aspect of life in California and is devastating many of the state's key industries. With the state's reserves approaching $21 billion, Newsom said the state has more money in its savings account than ever before. But he warned that 'the magnitude of this moment may exceed those reserves'. The state Legislature approved $1.1 billion in emergency spending Monday and then voted to suspend its session in what is believed to be the first unexpected work stoppage in 158 years. Lawmakers went one step further Tuesday by closing both the Capitol and the Legislative Office Building to the public 'until further notice.' It's all part of a rapidly escalating reaction that saw three more Northern California counties on Tuesday follow the example of those in the San Francisco Bay Area that told residents to stay at home and go outside only for food, medicine and other essential needs. At a news conference, Newsom did not announce a similar requirement statewide, but previously told bars, restaurants, movie theaters, fitness centers and other gathering places to shut their doors as the death toll crept to 12 and the number of confirmed cases neared 500.  All people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions have been encouraged to stay indoors. when readying the National Guard for action, Newsom's office emphasized it was for duties routinely performed during natural disasters and other emergencies. But Newsom grimly added that 'we have the ability to do martial law... if we feel the necessity.' Imposing martial law would take the extraordinary step of replacing the usual laws with military authority, with the possible suspension of civil liberties like freedom of association and movement. US and California health officials have repeatedly warned the virus could have a devastating impact and the timetable for controlling it isn't known. President Donald Trump on Monday said the crisis could last until August. California's 415 hospitals have been planning for a surge of patients. They have about 88,000 beds and Newsom said health officials are running models to determine needs based on various infection rates and resulting hospitalizations. Under worst-case scenarios, California could be short 20,000 beds, he said. 'So we had a very candid and a sober if not sobering conversation about where we may be and where we need to go together,' he said after the meeting with hospital officials. 'The good news is none of it surprised any of us. We as a state, working with our system, anticipated much of these needs and have been running plans to address them.' He said the state should have the two large hospitals in its possession as early as Friday and will use money from the emergency authorization to get them ready for service. Meantime, on the education front, Newsom said nearly 99 per cent of the state's K-12 schools are shuttered for periods generally ranging from two to five weeks. Newsom, a father of four young children, said his family is among those that have started home-schooling. 'It is unlikely that many of these schools, few if any, will open before the summer break,' he said, urging the more than 6 million schoolchildren and their families to make long-term plans. The state has applied for a federal waiver that means children would not have to face academic tests once they eventually return to school, said Newsom, a first-term Democrat. 'We think it is totally inappropriate for kids to worry about coming back and being tested,' he said. Newsom also shared a personal story that influenced his decision to tell the public to prepare for longer-than-expected closures. He said he returned home late Monday after a hectic day to find one of his two daughters, six-year-old Brooklynn, in her room, her stuffed bunny and most of her bedding on the floor. She was crying and upset about her school being closed and not seeing her friends. 'I told her, ""Honey, I don't think the schools are going to open again"",' Newsom said. 'If I can tell my daughter that and not tell your daughter... then I'm not being honest and true to the people of the state of California. Boy I hope I'm wrong, but I believe that to be the case.' California education and health officials late Tuesday offered guidelines for teachers to assist children with online learning, while offering free access to learning tools. It also offered guidelines for how to distribute free meals. Many of the shuttered schools may be used to provide meals to lower-income students and for child care, Newsom said. Providing child care at a time when residents are supposed to remain well separated to avoid spreading the disease brings its own challenges, Newsom said. Those caregivers 'will want to have personally protective gear, make sure social distancing is practiced, make sure that we not just secure the sites but make sure that they're healthy,' he said. He said some of the money approved by state lawmakers on Monday could go to help with that effort."
43,Tale of two coronavirus-hit cities: How New York and London have taken very different measures to tackle killer epidemicÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125501/How-New-York-London-taken-different-measures-tackle-killer-epidemic.html,"New York and London have had very different responses to the coronavirus crisis that has gripped Europe and the US in recent weeks. Mayor Bill de Blasio put most of the Big Apple on lockdown while in London shops and bars are still open while commuters are still catching the tube to work - all-be-it in reduced numbers. While there are differences in the make up of the cities - New York includes densely populated Manhattan Island, and sprawling London covers twice as many square miles - the varying approaches have raised questions about who has got the response right. The Big Apple and its five boroughs, with some8.6 million residents, has a similar population to London's8.8 million inhabitants. But New York City covers around half the area of Britain's capital, taking up302.6 square miles toLondon's 607 square miles - therefore making social distancing harder over a more densely populated area. Here we explore how the two cities are battling the pandemic. CASES London: London has so far recorded 480 cases with 26 deaths, making it the hardest hit area in Britain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people who live in London should pay special attention to government advice on isolation and social distancing, as the city is ahead of the rest of the country in terms of transmission speed. New York: New York has so far reported having 923 cases and 10 deaths from the virus. New York State with has separate virus figures has been the worst-hit in the US with more than 1,750 infections. TESTING London: Testingin Britain was limited only to those patients whose symptoms are so bad they have to be taken to hospital. Boris Johnson has been criticised for not carrying out mass testing, as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO's director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom, warned yesterday: 'You cannot fight a fire blindfolded, and we can not stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected.' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded an increase in testing on an 'industrial scale' - pointing to the advice from the WHO, which has been highly critical of the move to tell people with symptoms to isolate at home, without being diagnosed. Today, Johnson vowed a dramatic escalation of the UK's coronavirus testing capacity, saying the number of tests a day will be increased from the current level of around 5,000 to 25,000, with NHS staff prioritised. The announcement came amid mounting alarm about the level of screening, with fury that NHS health workers are being forced to self-isolate because they are unsure whether they have the disease or not. It has also been claimed that celebrities have been paying up to Â£345 to private firms for kits to check themselves for the virus at home. China's expert on the virus warned that 'herd immunity', that was championed by the British government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, will not contain the global pandemic because the disease is highly infectious and lethal. Dr Zhong Nanshan told a press conference today: 'Herd immunity won't solve the problem. We don't yet have the evidence to prove that if you are infected once, you would be immune for life.' New York: In New York, authorities said testing is free for all eligible residents, as ordered by a health care provider, but there have been a series of problems with getting the kits to those who need them. Donald Trump was also slammed for his slow response to the outbreak and for not providing sufficient tests as America's testing system significantly lagged behind other countries. Initially the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent out faulty test kits in February which significantly delayed testing. This was followed by a hold-up in sending replacement kits for several weeks. Then, regulatory red tape slowed down private labs who wanted to develop their own tests. Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the US government's response, has since pledged to increase the availability of tests. ENTERTAINMENT - BARS, RESTAURANTS AND THEATRES London: The British government has avoided ordering the closure of bars, cafes, restaurants and clubs. Residents have been advised not to go to gatherings of bars, cafes, clubs and restaurants, butPrime Minister Boris Johnson stopped short of ordering their closure on Monday. London's West End has become a virtual ghost town with Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square seeing a severe drop in traffic and shoppers. Some theares shut down, but some revellers still braved the capital's pubs to celebrate St Patrick's Day on Tuesday, despite the government advice. Johnson has been criticised for not ordering bars, cafes and restaurants to close and instead merely advising punters to stay away. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the government had left businesses 'high and dry', as they would have to take their own decision to close because of lack of demand and therefore not be covered by insurance claims if it was an enforced closure. New York: Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the city-wide shuttering of bars, cafes, restaurants, museums, theatres and libraries while public schools were also closed. He said on Tuesday he is considering making a 'shelter-in-place' order, meaning New Yorkers would only be able to leave their homes for food, medicine and exercise. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo today said there will be no 'shelter in place' order across the state, despite considering the move on Tuesday. The usually bustling Times Square, dubbed the 'crossroads of the world', saw just a handful of pedestrians and vehicles on Tuesday as the city went into lockdown. Some of New York's most popular bars were completely closed and Broadway was deserted as theatres cancelled their shows. SCHOOLS London: Despite many employees working from home and adults being advised to avoid mass gatherings, schools across Britain stayed open. In response many universities have take the decision themselves to stop holding face-to-face lectures with students taking part in classes remotely via video. Jeremy Hunt, the former Tory health secretary and colleague of Johnson's, criticised the PM for not acting faster, describing it as'surprising and concerning'. Rory Stewart, the former Conservative international development secretary who is running to be London mayor as anindependent candidate also slammed Johnson. He said: 'They [the government] should be acting much more aggressively to contain coronavirus. 'Schools should be shut now. If the government are not prepared to shut them now, they should, at the very least, state clearly and transparently what their triggers will be for closing schools over the next few days.' New York: In New York all schools were ordered to be closed along with social venues such as theatres, bars and restaurants. WORK London: Boris Johnson warned Britons to avoid social contact, to work from home where possible and advised people to stay away from public gatherings. New York: The US federal government on Monday urged Americans not to gather in groups of 10 or more and asked older people to stay home. TRANSPORT London: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the London Underground would be running a reduced service after passenger numbers dropped and many commuters worked from home. But many in London are still travelling on the Underground in order to get to work. On Wednesday, rush hour commuters were still being forced to cram into carriages despite the need to keep their distance from other travellers. Trains later in the day were noticeably quieter. New York: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York said it does not plan on changing subway and bus service. Both authorities in London and New York have been carrying out deep cleans of their infrastructure that is most used by the public, such as ticket terminals and hand rails. SPORT London: The London Marathon, which was scheduled to take place on April 26, was postponed until October 4. Wembley Stadium will no longer host Euro 2020 Championships matches it had been allocated after the tournament was postponed until next year. England's international soccer matches at Wembley against Italy and Denmark, due to be played later this month, have also been cancelled. All London's five Premier League teams have had their fixtures postponed after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea midfielder Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive. New York: New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets games were postponed after the National Basketball Association said on March 11 that it was suspending the season until further notice after a Utah Jazz player, Rudy Gobert, tested positive for the virus."

Soprano Begona Alberdi belted out the song from her apartmentin the stylist Eixample district of Barcelona and promised one every night. The 56-year-old is quarantined with her husband following the dramatic decision to shut down the country on Sunday. Footage showsneighbours gathered on their balconies, with one saying 'wow' as Alberdi's powerful voice fills the air. At one point, the cameraman appears to tear up and can be heard sniffling behind the lens. The clip ends with a deafening round of applause from the hundreds of apartments who had been listening. It comes after footage emerged from the coronavirus lockdowns in Rome, Naples and Milan, showing Italians singing from their homes. Shut-in neighbours in Denmark have also been spotted leaning out of their apartmentsto sing Carol King's 'You've Got A Friend', while Parisians clapped health workers last night in France. Alberdi, who has performed for over 30 years, said: 'It was 8pm and neighbours applauded hospital workers and we cheered them on too. It was so moving to see everybody coming together to thank them. 'It touched me and I thought, we live in a very cool world. I thought I want to sing and my husband told me ''do it then'' so I started singing.' She added: 'Now is time to stay at home. We will have time to go on walks and do normal stuff later, this is a life lesson, to make us feel that common objectives can be accomplished after this.' Alberdi's friend alerted her to the videos of her singing on social media, adding that people have asked her to do it daily. She said: 'It is so beautiful and I will continue to carry on during the whole lockdown, one song every evening. 'I have performed at the Liceu [Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona] 273 times and now it seems I have become famous for singing at my window.' Large swathes of Europe has shut down to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak, with the continent recording at least 69,830 cases and 3,000 deaths."
45,Skirting the rules: Fitness trainers set up speakeasy-style studios so they can continue hosting intimate workout classes after gyms were shut down as a result of coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8127243/Fitness-trainers-set-intimate-speakeasy-style-studios-amid-coronavirus.html,"With gyms across the country closing amid the coronavirus pandemic, personal trainers are finding creative ways to keep working with their clients, from speakeasy-style studio gyms that fit only a handful of people to one-on-one sessions at their homes. On Sunday Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti ordered the closure of gyms, restaurants, and movie theaters to prevent the spread of the virus, but some high-end trainers are skirting the rules for both financial security and the wellness of their clients, TMZ has reported. The outlet spoke with several fitness instructors in and around the LA area who are hosting their affluent clients at intimate studio gyms that accommodate just four or five people at a time â€” including the trainer. Celebrity trainer Mike O'Hearn told TMZ that he is having clients come to him, so they can work out at his fully-equipped home gym, which he diligently has cleaned and sanitized. While he believes working up a sweat is a good way to boost your immune system, he has been encouraging people to stay home if they are feeling ill. O'Hearn isn't the only trainer who is continuing to work with clients during the national emergency. Adam Friedman of Advanced Athletics has a mix of clients ranging from everyday people to professional athletes. He told the Los Angeles Times that he is already thinking of ways to serve his clients now that Gold's Gym in Venice has closed. 'This is a matter of survival so Iâ€™m going to do whatever it takes,' he said. 'I had already anticipated asking clients about training at home,' he added. 'Iâ€™m also starting to build an online platform where I can guide people through their fitness routines.' Frmation, a Los Angeles-based fitness studio founded by Justine Kennedy, revealed on its Instagram page that they will continue to offer private lessons while closed to the public. 'Our clients' safety and health will continue to be our top priority, and although we will not be in the studio together, we remain open for privates and have additional availability for those interested,' the trainer explained. 'Feel free to DM us and we will get you set up for the upcoming weeks.' Kennedy, who works with actress Rebecca Gayheart, added that Frmation is also 'working on supplying an online alternative for at-home workouts.' Trainers who are abiding by the rules and avoiding face-to-face contact with their clients have found other ways to keep their scheduled sweat sessions. David Otey, a New York City-based trainer and Men's Health Advisory Board member, told Men's Health that he had planned on continuing his in-person training until gyms in the state were ordered to close. He, like many other trainers, is now working with his clients remotely using FaceTime or Skype to oversee the workout sessions. Otey took to Instagram on Tuesday to share workout tips along with a video of himself living weights in his home gym in New Jersey. Many studios that have shuttered its doors are now relying on digital streaming classes to keep customers. Gwyneth Paltrow's beloved trainer Tracy Anderson closed all of her studios in New York, Los Angeles, and Spain, on Sunday and is providing both virtual one-on-one training sessions as well as classes through her Tracey Anderson Online Studio. 'I am filming content for @tracyandersononlinestudio alone until further notice, but yet the beauty is that I am not alone, and neither are you,' she wrote on Instagram last Friday. 'I love to film in my classes because they provide me with instant energy that is easy for me to tap into. The incredible truth of my relationship with all of you is that we have those lines of energy that are really that strong.' LEKFIT, Busy Philipps' go-to studio, is closed to the public until March 31 but will continue to offer digital streaming classes. The studio is also offering curbside pickup for anyone in LA who needs to buy equipment to follow the workouts at home. The studio was still open last week when Busy revealed that she was streaming the trampoline workouts at home as an extra precaution. '@lektfit streaming is keeping me sane,' she captioned a video of herself doing a series of leg lifts. Celebrity trainer Anna Kaiser, who has worked with Kelly Ripa and Sarah Jessica Parker, streamed her 60-minute workout live from herAKT Nomad studio in New York City live on Wednesday morning. And some kindhearted trainers such as Lacey Stone and Kardashian-family favorite Don Brooks have been offering free Instagram Live workouts during these trying times. A great deal of popular studios already offered online classes and streaming before the coronavirus outbreak, but those who didn't are now scrambling to catch up. Last week, Equinox Media launched the release of its streaming platform, Variis, which offers on-demand fitness classes from SoulCycle, Pure Yoga, and Equinox, among others. Celebrity trainer Justin Gelband, who has worked withKarlie Kloss, Chrissy Teigen, Candice Swanepoel, announced on Instagram on Tuesday that Sequence NYC will soon be streaming his workouts. 'We are all learning this social distancing thing, but we need to STAY ACTIVE and KEEP MOVING!' he wrote. 'Thank you for your support and stay tuned for more details of IG Live classes, streaming platform details and more!' And BurnAlong, a company that helps gyms and studios get their workouts online, has seen an uptick in inquiries from fitness companies in Southern California over the past few days,BurnAlong Co-ChiefExecutive Daniel Friedman told the Los Angeles Times. Actually Awesome Yoga, Open Circles, Theta Pin, and True Fitness were among about 500 gyms and studios that had turned to the company to get their classes online during the pandemic."

Cleaning expert Sandra Redmond, of British company Molly Maid cleaners, revealed the steps everyone can take to keep their homes sparkling, especially with many spending more time inside. Her tips include scrubbing countertops with soapy water before spraying with any product, and wiping down lesser-cleaned areas like the kettle handle and coffee pot every day. Here, Molly shares her tips with FEMAIL... CLEAN BEFORE YOU SANITISE 'Don't just sanitise â€“ clean first then sanitise.We can be tempted to run through our house with disinfectant wipes or spray in hand and using them on all surfaces. 'But it's better to first clean the area with a soapy sponge and/or cloth and then apply any disinfectant. Though it is recommended that surfaces that are being frequently touched by hands, yours and others, such as light switches, door handles (your outside door handle especially) are sanitised daily, you may not have sufficient time to do this. Considering doing these every other day but use a sanitiser or warm soapy water. Appliances such as the kettle and coffee machine, don't get as much use so once a week may be sufficient. Again, consider using a sanitiser or warm soapy water. Remember to unplug any small appliance before cleaning it. In terms of what to clean, anything that you are putting your hands on, should be cleaned. A good rule of thumb is to thoroughly wash your hands when you get home before you touch anything. This is when you are likely to be spreading unwanted germs.  'Also, leave the disinfectant untouched on surfaces for around 30 seconds before wiping. 'In normal times you would want to clean and sanitise every few days, but these are anything but normal times. 'Clean and sanitise kitchen counter-tops daily. 'The reality is that these are used daily, so you should consider cleaning and sanitising them daily. DON'T FORGET CUPBOARDS AND KETTLES 'Remember to clean commonly touched areas. 'While large surfaces like kitchen counter tops get the most attention, don't forget to clean and disinfect those areas we frequently touch such as the kettle, coffee machine, door and window handles, makeup packages, remote controls and possibly the most forgotten area in the kitchen â€“ cupboard and appliance handles. 'Though it is recommended that surfaces that are being frequently touched by hands, yours and others, such as light switches, door handles (your outside door handle especially) are sanitised daily, you may not have sufficient time to do this. 'Considering doing these every other day but use a sanitiser or warm soapy water.' PUT YOUR SPONGES IN THE DISHWASHER 'The very things you use to clean other things is often teeming with germs itself. The Global Hygiene Council found that an average of 19.6 billion bacteria live in the kitchen sponges in British homes. 'You might not want to think about that too much! The good news is that it's easy to send those 19.6 billion bacteria on their merry way. 'Regularly wash your hands.Get into a regular practice of washing your hands when you return home and before you touch anything else.' 'How to clean:Just pop the sponge into the dishwasher or washing machine, or give it a scrub with hot soapy water yourself. 'You could also put it in the microwave on high for a minute or two â€“ and while you're at it, put any other sponges or cloths you regularly use such as bathroom sponges. 'Another tip is to use microfibre cloths because these are easily laundered and very quickly. RUN YOUR WASHING MACHINE - WITH NOTHING IN IT 'To prevent the spread of germs, all underwear, towels and household linen should be washed at 60C or at 40C with a bleach-based, or bio, laundry product. 'It's also a good idea to run the washing machine on empty once a week, either at a high temperature or with a chemical disinfectant to prevent the growth of germs and try not to leave wet washing in the machine as this will only serve to encourage the growth of germs.'"
47,NASA's ISS is the SAFEST place during the coronavirus outbreak due to its health stabilization program that began after the common cold boarded the Apollo 7 mission in 1968,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8126881/NASAs-ISS-SAFEST-place-coronavirus-health-stabilization-program.html,"With at least 164 countries around the world battling coronavirus, there seems to be only one place that has not been infected â€“the International Space Station (ISS). NASA has a strategy in place to prevent astronauts from carrying potentially dangerous viruses and pathogens to the ISS known as 'health stabilization.' Crews heading to the ISS undergo a physical exam 10 days before launch, which includes swabs and other lab tests to make sure they are not currently infected with a disease. If the results prove negative, each individual is asked to limit contact with the public and then enter into a two week-period of quarantine to determine if they are incubating an illness. SpaceX is set to launch its first manned craft carrying two NASA astronauts in May and according to both the firm and NASA, the mission to space is still on despite the pandemic spreading on Earth. Scroll down for video Governments and agencies across the globe are scrambling to limit the spread of the coronavirus â€“ there are more than 206,000 cases and over 8,000 confirmed deaths around the world. Health organizations have released recommendations that include washing hands, social distancing and quarantining those who have been exposed or contracted the virus. However, such tactics have been used by NASA for years and on numerous occasions. Luis Zea, a researcher from BioServe Space Technologies at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Newsweek: 'I would say that, regarding coronavirus, the ISS is probably one of the safest places to be at this point.' 'This comes from the fact that the novel coronavirus can only survive for short periods of time on surfaces and an infected person would likely be screened and diagnosed during the quarantine period astronauts go through prior to launch.' NASA began the health stabilization program following the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 when Wally Schirra, a veteran of both Mercury and Gemini missions, came down with the common cold. Walt Cunningham, who was also on the Apollo 7 mission, said: 'The impact of Wally's cold was tremendous,' Cunningham said, according to BBC News. 'Wally had to blow his nose pretty regularly and he would blow his nose once and fold the Kleenex away â€“ after a couple of times, Don and I said, 'No, no, you're going to have to use those Kleenex more than that.' Schirra's illness made him tired and irritable, and this was reflected in his communications with the ground. Following this fiasco, NASA moved to put health safety preventions in place. Along with being quarantined for observation, all of the astronauts undergo medical training and stay in contact with a team of doctors while aboard the ISS who are able to monitor their health and vitals from the ground. Items sent to the ship are also thoroughly cleaned and sterilize, which will help keep coronavirus from traveling with them, as the virus is unable to survive on objects for a long period of time. 'Items that go up to Station are thoroughly cleaned and sometimes, depending on the item itself, may be sterilized, Zea told Newsweek. 'However, a stringent requirement for sterilization exists for spacecraft that will land on other celestial bodies to ensure that, in the future when we 'sniff' more molecules indicative of potential life, we are not sniffing something that a previous spacecraft brought into that planet. 'In the case of the ISS, microbes travel with the crew, like it or not. In fact, a human has more bacterial cells in and on their body than their own cells, so it doesn't matter where we go, bacteria will accompany us.' The ISS is also designed with 'lifeboats' docked to it that allow all crew members to quickly evacuate in case of an emergency. The International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (Â£80 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000. Research conducted aboard theISSoften requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen. ISS studies have investigatedhuman research,space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology. The US space agency, Nasa, spends about $3 billion (Â£2.4 billion) a year on the space station program, a level of funding that is endorsed by the Trump administration and Congress. A U.S. House of Representatives committee that oversees Nasa has begun looking at whether to extend the program beyond 2024. Alternatively the money could be used to speed up planned human space initiatives to the moon and Mars. "
48,Relax! San Francisco's cannabis dispensaries are declared 'essential' and will be allowed to stay open during coronavirus lockdown for medicinal and recreational usersÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125881/San-Franciscos-cannabis-dispensaries-stay-open-citys-coronavirus-lockdown.html,"San Francisco's cannabis dispensaries have been told they can stay open despite the city going into lockdown over the coronavirus outbreak. The Department of Public Health (DPH) announced in a tweet Tuesday afternoon that cannabis dispensaries can continue to offer delivery and pick-up services across the city because marijuana is classed as an 'essential medicine'. The decision to make the drug storesexempt from the city's shelter in place order means both residents who use marijuana for medicinal purposes and those who use it for recreational reasons can continue to get high during the pandemic. The move backpedaled on previous rules which had shuttered the stores on Monday, when San Francisco went into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. The city's information page on the lockdown stated on Monday and for much of Tuesday that 'recreational retailers are not an essential service' andThe Office of Cannabis had told dispensary owners they must close. City leaders and activists slammed the move to shut the stores, saying the drug is'essential' to people who use it medicinally. 'Cannabis dispensaries should be able to stay open, for take out and delivery only,' San Francisco District 6 Supervisor Matt Haney said on Twitter. 'They shouldn't be told to close. They obviously serve as pharmacies for a lot of people.' The backlash led city officials to renege on initial plans with the DPH tweeting on Tuesday afternoon that the stores now fall into the 'essential' category.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed also tweeted Tuesday evening: 'Cannabis is an needed medicine for many San Franciscans and dispensaries are allowed to continue operating.' Dispensaries sell to bothrecreational users and medicinal users, meaning both groups will be able to continue buying the drug during the pandemic. Cannabis users are being advised to keep a distance of six feet from other people when visiting the stores and on-site consumption remains banned as part of social distancing efforts. Legal cannabis is big business in San Francisco, with about $2.5 billion worth of the the drug sold each year in the state of California.  Fears of a ban on the stores sent vast swathes of people queuing up in the streets outside dispensaries on Monday to stock up. Even in light of the initial lockdown advice, some dispensaries continued to stay open Tuesday, according to the San Francisco Examiner. Grass Roots in Lower Nob Hill and Stiiizy Mission in the Outer Mission kept their doors open Tuesday for customer collections.

49,The Pope says he has asked God to stop the coronavirus epidemic and says people should use quarantine to reconnect with their families,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125507/The-Pope-says-asked-God-stop-coronavirus-epidemic.html,"Pope Francis has asked God to stop the coronavirus epidemic and said people should use their time in quarantine to reconnect with their families. It comes as Italy is battling with the most acute outbreak of COVID-19 outside of China, with 27,980 infections and2,503 deaths as of Tuesday. The Pope has been spending the last few days in the Vatican, although he defied the country's nationwide lockdown on Sunday afternoon to pray for victims of the disease at two churches in the Italian capital. Speaking to daily Italian publication La Repubblica on Wednesday, he said he had asked God to stop the epidemic in Italy 'with his hand'. The 83-year-old pontiff continued:'We must rediscover the concrete nature of small things, of making small gestures toward those around us - family, friends.' 'They are gestures of tenderness, of affection, of compassion, which are nonetheless decisive and important - for example, a hot dish, a caress, a hug, a phone call.' Italian rules instruct everyone to keep one metre (three feet) apart while in public but say nothing about what people can do at home. Addressing those who have lost loved ones in the coronavirus crisis, the Pope said: 'I ask everyone to stay close to those who have lost loved ones, to be close to them in every possible way.' The pope himself has been suffering from a cold since last month. His comments come after the Pope defied Italian government advice to stay indoors and on Sunday walked to church through Rome's deserted streets to pray for the end of the virus. He left the Vatican to visit two churches in the Italian capital, first praying in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore before strolling down the usually bustling Via del Corso. He headed to the St Marcello al Corso, which poignantly hosts a crucifix carried in a 1522 procession in Rome when the city was stricken with plague. Flanked by his security detail, the 83-year-old pope, who has been nursing a cold, decided to walk through the streets 'as if on a pilgrimage,' Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. "
50,Pound slumps to 35-YEAR low against the US dollar as UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's $500billion coronavirus bailout fails to calm markets,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125017/FTSE-100-drops-3-fears-spread-coronavirus-intensify.html,"The pound slumped to a 35-year low against the US dollar today as the Chancellor's Â£350billion coronavirus bailout failed to calm the markets. Sterling dropped to 1.175 against the American currency, while the FTSE lost more than 3 per cent as it teetered on the edge of the psychologically important 5,000 level. The grim slide for the Pound - to the lowest level since 1985 - came as Rishi Sunak defended his package for keeping the UK economy afloat amid the mounting crisis. Boris Johnson has also been facing heavy criticism for his response to the situation, with claims the lockdown was imposed too slowly and there has not been enough testing. Mr Sunak was giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee this afternoon as the Pound hit its low. But he denied that the UK's bailout package was smaller than that in other countries such as France. He said: 'Looking at it in the totality of the fiscal intervention and adding the 30 (billion pounds) and the 20 (billion pounds) together which is Â£50 billion, and then looking at that as a percentage of GDP, for example, you can benchmark to most large economies and you would see that the totality of what we're doing relative to almost any large economy thus far is very significant and I do think that is the right way to look at it... 'In terms of the overall quantum, I think on a benchmark basis as we've done it, it looks like a very comprehensive package.' Mr Sunak also said that measures for individuals and families would be outlined 'as soon as they are developed and hopefully we can have broad support for them'. Asked about the performance of the Pound, Mr Sunak insisted Chancellors never commented on the currency. The FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest firms fell 280 points or 5.3 per cent in the first three hours of trading to 5,015 today. It clawed back some of its losses during the day, ending the day down 198 points or 3.7 per cent at 5,097 this afternoon. Investor sentiment in Europe has been crushed over the past month as countries imposed lockdowns to halt the spread. Similar falls were seen in Europe this morning, where Frankfurt's DAX 30 tanked 4 per cent to 8,581 points and the Paris CAC 40 dropped 2.3 per cent to 3,898 points. US stock futures slid 3.7 per cent in Asia overnight, a day after the S&P 500 rose 6 per cent to 2,529 and the Dow Jones gained 5.2 per cent to 21,237. The FTSE 100 has fallen about 30 per cent since coronavirus fears really began to grip investors on February 24, although it did rebound yesterday by 2.8 per cent. Ed Monk, associate director from Fidelity Personal Investing's share dealing service, said: 'The damage to the corporate world from the COVID-19 outbreak is beginning to be laid out via a host of warnings to the stock market this morning. 'Along with airlines and travel, hospitality will be among the first hit. Brewer Marston's, Wagamama owner The Restaurant Group and Revolutions Bars all warned that trading will be significantly impacted this year. 'Fashion retailer Superdry also confirmed that not only will it not meet profit guidance issued as recently as January, but that it will now not issue guidance for this year. 'Software firm MicroFocus confirmed that it will now not pay a final dividend. Even supermarket Morrisons - which is in a sector that enjoys some insulation in the crisis - confirmed that a planned special dividend now won't be paid.' Italy's prime minister yesterday declared the virus was causing a 'socio-economic tsunami' as European leaders agreed to seal off external borders. Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, said: 'Right now the predominant concern is that all the shutdowns of just about everything is going to lead to a recession. 'The sentiment is being dominated by those fears far outweighing everything else.' Following dramatic monetary policy easing by some of the world's biggest central banks earlier in the week, US President Donald Trump pressed yesterday for a $1trillion stimulus package, while many other governments looked to fiscal stimulus. European airlines and energy firms have been among the biggest decliners as the health crisis halts nearly all travel, crushes oil prices and cripples company finances. The Government has been urged to do more to support the poorest members of society in the wake of the outbreak after allegations the Chancellor's Â£350 billion package did 'nothing' to protect home renters and those on low incomes. Rishi Sunak vowed to do 'whatever it takes' to buoy the economy when he revealed his 'unprecedented' fiscal cannon yesterday, as the number of people thought to have the virus in the UK rose to 55,000 and the official death toll climbed to 71. Yet his package of measures designed to protect businesses was criticised after it failed to acknowledge financial means of supporting those in rental accommodation and people on low incomes amid concerns over potential job losses."
51,"Worldwide coronavirus infection toll hits 200,000 after doubling in less than two weeks",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8125803/Worldwide-coronavirus-infection-toll-hits-200-000-doubling-two-weeks.html,"The worldwide infection toll for the killer coronavirus has now topped 200,000 after doubling in less than two weeks. Cases of the highly contagious virus now exceed 203,000, according to data compiled by the John Hopkins University. The global toll reached six figures on March 7, more than two months after the outbreak first began in Wuhan, China, in late December. But another 100,000 people were infected in just 11 days since then, largely due to a surge in cases in Europe,sparking fears the crisis will only continue to get worse. At least 160 countries and territories around the world have reported cases in every continent except Antarctica. The John Hopkins University also recorded 8,006 deaths, suggesting around4 per cent of patients who catch the virus die from it. But experts say the death rate is probably lower than that becauseof an under-reporting of cases. Many countries - including the UK - are only testing people who are hospitalised due to the virus. Thousands of people will make a full recovery without ever knowing they were infected. Patients infected with the killer coronavirus shed large amounts of the virus before severe symptoms appear, a study has shown. And people continue to remain contagious even after they feel better, researchers found. The German study â€“ one of the first coronavirus studies to have been conducted outside China â€“ confirms the theory that people can spread the virus before they even know they are infected. But it also suggests they can spread it after they recover from the infection. Researchers from the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology in Munich took samples from the nose and throat of nine COVID-19 patients. Results showed the samples had a very high viral load when the subjects were only showing minor symptoms, such as fatigue or a cough.. China, Italy, Iran, Spain and Germanyhave suffered the highest number of infections, according to the team at John Hopkins. Meanwhile, the number of recovered patients around the world has exceeded 82,000, the American universityâ€™s figures show. As fears grow that the pandemic cannot be stopped, some UK scientists suggested that the only way to beat it is through 'herd immunity'. When a coronavirus patient recovers from the illness, their body builds up an immunity to it. If a high enough proportion of a community become protected this way, it stops the disease circulating because the number of people who can be infected is so small.This is called herd immunity. ButChina's top coronavirus expert today warned herd immunity was a counterproductive measure that will not contain the global pandemic because the disease is too infectious and lethal. Dr Zhong Nanshan, the country's senior medical adviser told a press conference:'Herd immunity won't solve the problem.' 'We don't yet have the evidence to prove that if you are infected once, you would be immune for life. Our next step is to develop effective vaccines, which requires global cooperation.' It comes as coronavirus deaths in Europe exceed the toll in Asia for the first time. Europe has suffered at least 3,421 deaths - the majority coming from Italy - compared with 3,384 in Asia. But Italian coronavirus infections have slowed in recent days after the country took drastic quarantine measures to stop the spread of the pathogen. The figures are a sobering warning to Britain, which unlike Italy has not closed schools, shut down shops or blocked travel. The number of daily cases in Italy has been stagnant in the last four days, settling down at around 3,500 new patients per day. Yesterday's increase in the overall tally was 12.6 per cent, the second-lowest rate since the virus began spreading in Italy on February 21 - offering hope that the lockdown is bearing fruit even as the death toll rose by 345 to 2,503. Italians have been ordered to stay indoors, with schools and universities shut, shops closed except for grocery stores and pharmacies, and heavy restrictions on travel. But in Britain, which has taken none of those measures, the 407 new cases yesterday represented the largest daily jump since the virus came to the UK. Experts warn that there is a lag time between health measures being taken and their effects becoming conspicuous. That suggests the Italian lockdown imposed last week could now be starting to have a noticeable impact. The number of new infections in the last four days has been fairly stagnant with 3,497 on Saturday, 3,590 on Sunday, 3,233 on Monday and 3,526 on Tuesday. The Italian death toll rose by 345 to 2,503, with total infections now at 31,506. The percentage increase in cases has been below 20 per cent for the last few days, falling to 12.6 per cent yesterday. Britain's increase yesterday was 26.4 per cent, although it was only 10.9 per cent the day before. The signs of a slowing infection rate will be a relief to doctors on the front line of Italy's coronavirus outbreak, who have described 'catastrophic' scenes in hospitals which are creaking with the sheer volume of cases. They tell of critically ill patients who should be in intensive care but are instead slumped in busy wards because of a woeful lack of equipment and staff. Worryingly, the doctors who have spoken out are from state-of-the-art hospitals which typically provide excellent care but were caught flat-footed by the virus which is stretching their capacity to breaking point. Medics are struggling to keep pace with the escalating number of cases, including those treating patients at the advanced Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in the wealthy city of Bergamo in the virus-plagued Lombardy region. The 950-bed hospital has been brought to its knees because of the crisis, with more than 400 of the beds used by coronavirus patients and three of the hospital's four most senior staff off sick. Intensive care specialist Mirco Nacoti told the Wall Street Journal: 'Until three weeks ago, we did everything for every patient. 'Now we have to choose which patients to put in intensive care. This is catastrophic.' The hospital's once rapid emergency response is also at breaking point, with even people reporting heart attacks waiting an hour on the phone because the lines are being bombarded. Dr Angelo Giupponi, who coordinates Papa Giovanni's emergency response, said his team takes 2,500 calls daily and brings 1,500 to hospital. Signalling the team were caught off-guard by the epidemic, he said that ambulance staff have not been trained for such a contagion, and revealed many have become infected after their vehicles became contaminated. Dispatcher Diego Bianco, a 40-something with no underlying health conditions, even died. In a sign that Rome is scrambling to react to the outbreak, Dr Sergio Cattaneo said he has seen unused wards outfitted into an intensive care unit in six days. He also claims a hospital laundry room was converted into a giant stretcher-filled waiting room and a tented field hospital erected outside to test possible new virus patients. Dr Cattaneo, head of anesthesiology and intensive care at the public hospital in Brescia in northern Italy, said: 'What is really shocking - something we had not been able to forecast and brought us to our knees - is the quickness the epidemic spreads. Chinese health officials carried out the biggest ever study on the never-before-seen strain of the virus, using data from 72,000 cases. Results showed the SARS-CoV-2 virus posed the greatest threat to older patients and those with underlying conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. It also revealed the exact breakdown of the cases that had been confirmed. AGE 0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+ CASES (%) 416 (0.9%) 549 (1.2%) 3,619 (8.1%) 7,600 (17.0%) 8,571 (19.2%) 10,008 (22.4%) 8,583 (19.2%) 3,918 (8.8%) 1,408 (3.2%) And what about deaths? AGE 0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+ DEATHS (%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.1%) 7 (0.7%) 18 (1.8%) 38 (3.7%) 130 (12.7%) 309 (30.2%) 312 (30.5%) 208 (20.3%) 'If the spreading of this epidemic is not put under control, it will bring all hospitals to their knees.' Dr Cattaneo's new ICU added six more beds to the hospital's capacity, bringing to 42 the number of ICU beds dedicated to the virus. Across the Lombardy region, local authorities are pushing ahead with plans to build a 400-bed ICU field hospital at the Milan fairgrounds, even though the civil protection agency has warned that it doesn't have the ventilators or personnel to staff it, and that time is running out. 'The secret has been - and this should be a strong message for foreign countries - to act early on this, in order to avoid - like in our case - having to chase after it day after day,' Cattaneo said. Brescia, an industrial city of nearly 200,000 east of Milan and the capital of a province of 1.2million, is second only to nearby Bergamo in positive cases in Lombardy, the epicenter of the pandemic in Europe. For the past two days, Brescia actually outpaced Bergamo in the number of new infections, on Tuesday adding another 382 positive tests for a total of 3,300 and suggesting that it is becoming Lombardy's hottest hot spot. Indeed, seven of Brescia's deaths this week were among residents of the same nursing home in Barbariga, where another eight elderly people tested positive, local media reported. While many people suffer relatively mild symptoms from the virus, the mortality rate in Italy in people over 80 is 22 percent, according to statistics from the National Institutes of Health. It has been a race against time for Lombardy to add more ICU beds than the patients who need them, not an easy task given that 10 percent of all Italy's infected require ICU admission, primarily for respiratory help. Nearly all admitted patients have interstitial pneumonia, a disease in which the lace-like tissue of the lungs' alveoli become inflamed, leading to progressive respiratory failure, according to Giovanna Perone, director of Brescia's emergency services. 'In the last few days, the number of people arriving here on their own and reporting such symptoms has increased,' Perone said outside the civil protection tents where walk-in patients are tested and then sent to the hospital's converted laundry room to await the results. The onslaught of infections has completely overwhelmed the public health system in Italy's prosperous north, prompting regional officials to beg retired doctors to come back to work and to accelerate graduation dates for nurses and specialists. 'I ask you from my heart, we need your competency, your experience, your efficiency,' said Giulio Gallera, Lombardy's chief healthcare official. 'Give us a hand.' The 25 billion euro aid package the Italian government approved Monday, aimed at bolstering both the health care system and helping businesses, workers and families weather the economic hit, also contains provisions to hire 10,000 more medical personnel. Already Lombardy this week has received 2,200 responses to a 'help wanted' sign on its Facebook page, and hired over 1,000 people, Gallera said. Italy's medical personnel also complain about critical shortages of gear, including protective masks and glasses. Italy's national federations of doctors and nurses issued a joint alarm Tuesday over the more than 2,300 medical personnel who have been infected, 1,900 of them doctors and nurses. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world. "
52,So much for the lockdown: Twerking spring breakers party on St Patrick's Day in Miami's South Beach despite mayor canceling event due to coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125045/Spring-breakers-partying-St-Patricks-Day-South-Beach.html,"Spring breakers have been partying in Miami and still hanging out on South Beach despite curfews curbing large gatherings due to coronavirus. Sections of South Beach were still bustling with holidaymakers on Tuesday despite the pandemic and advice from public health officials to limit gatherings to fewer than 10 people. Over the weekend, Florida officials implemented new restrictions in the area to try and halt the spread of the virus. So far there have been 192 known cases of the infection and six deaths in the state. In South Beach - the most popular part of Miami Beach where thousands flock to spend spring break - an 11pm curfew was introduced and crowds were limited to no more than 250 people. On Saturday Miami Beach City Manager, Jimmy Morales, enacted emergency measures to curb spring breakers from crowding in South Beach with the help of police and civilian ambassadors. But spring breakers yesterday were partying by the hundreds on some beaches, while police have been sweeping others, ordering people away through loud speakers. St. Patrick Day parties and parades, that would have been held on Tuesday, were cancelled around the world. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, said on Monday that due to the outbreak and orders issued by the White House, that spring break was 'canceled' and declared a state of emergency. He said: 'Our measures are intended to send a clear message that spring break is canceled and that everyone, even young people home from school, need to embrace these health and safety concerns.' The federal government on Monday urged Americans not to gather in groups of 10 or more and asked older people to stay home, as the number of infections in the US climbed to more than 6,400, with at least 114 deaths. But hard rules have been left up to the states, creating what New York Govenor Andrew Cuomo derided as a 'hodgepodge'. In South Beach bars, cafes, restaurants and beaches stayed open on Saturday, leading to federal health officials to greet sunbathers with a floating sign warning them to keep their distance from people with symptoms. By early Saturday evening, Miami Beach police began deterring large groups from Lummus Park and clearing the most popular stretches of South Beach, which because of school closings and extended spring breaks had seen more visitors soaking up the rays. Yesterday Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ordered the shutdown of all bars in the state for at least 30 days and limited beach gatherings to no more than 10 people. DeSantis also restricted restaurant occupancy to 50 per cent but left further beach restrictions up to local authorities, and Miami Beach officials enacted a beach closures along a section of the most popular beaches and an 11pm curfew. From 5th Street to 15th Street the famous South Beach was closed on Tuesday, pushing sunseekers to less popular areas that remained open. An empty length of the beach could be seen on Tuesday, as cops closed off the stretch at Ocean Drive, which is usually the epicenter of spring break partying. But young people continued to flout the new guidelines which advised against partying in large groups or gathering in bars and public places. Public areas including playgrounds and portions of the beach boardwalk were closed off as part of the orders. From midnight on Tuesday all bars and restaurants will be closed in Miami Beach following an order from the city's mayor. The famous Duck Tour bus was still operating along Ocean Drive, albeit with markedly fewer passengers as of yesterday. Elsewhere in America, large swathes of major cities looked like ghost towns as sweeping lockdowns were imposed. Officials in six San Francisco Bay Area counties issued a shelter-in-place mandate on Monday affecting nearly 7 million people, ordering residents to stay at home and go outside only for food, medicine and outings that are absolutely essential. The order says residents must stay inside and venture out only for necessities for three weeks. It affects the counties of San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Contra Costa and Alameda, which includes the cities of Berkeley and Oakland."
53,Savannah Guthrie anchors the Today show from her BASEMENT at home after coming down with a 'mild sore throat' and the 'sniffles' amid coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8125871/Savannah-Guthrie-anchors-Today-home-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"Savannah Guthrie made Today history on Wednesday morning when she co-anchored the morning show from her basement at home, after coming down with a 'mild sore throat' and 'the sniffles' amid the coronavirus pandemic. The 48-year-old mother-of-two revealed on Tuesday night that she would be joining her co-anchor Hoda Kotb via video link, while sharing images of the mini studio that had been set up in her New York City basement. 'Hi everybody! Well, this will be a first. Iâ€™m going to be anchoring Today from my house!' she wrote on Instagram - while insisting that she is simply acting out of 'an abundance of caution' and 'to model the super vigilance the CDC has asked of us'. 'Iâ€™m staying home because I have a mild sore throat and runny nose,' she continued. 'This was the advice of NBCâ€™s superb medical team and my bosses. I feel good and am sure I will be back in no time - but during these days, itâ€™s on all of us to be extra cautious and caring of those around us. 'So see you tomorrow on Today - from my basement!' The news comes as it was revealed that a staffer on the Third Hour of Today had tested positive for COVID-19, which NBC revealing on Monday that it had asked hosts Al Roker and Craig Melvin to remain home and 'trace their contacts' to ensure they had not come into contact with the person. As of Tuesday, both were also tuning into the show from home, with Al and Savannah both joining Hoda, 55, via video link on Wednesday morning - a first for the popular morning show. 'And we are back on a busy Wednesday morning, one not like a normal one here on Today,' Savannah said while opening the show. 'This show has been around a long time, 60-something years, but never has this happened before. 'We've got Hoda in our studio, Al and I are working from home, Craig is actually [working] from home as well, we're going to talk to him a little bit later this morning.' Savannah went on to joke about her very 'short' commute, noting that she had simply had to walk down some stairs in order to get to work on Wednesday. 'I will say Hoda, this was the shortest commute in the history of the world,' she told her co-anchor, who clarified that Savannah was in fact 'in her basement'. 'Yeah, I walked down the stairs!' the mom-of-two responded. Hoda then admitted that the set-up on viewers' screens - which showed Savannah in one box, Hoda in another, and Al in a third - was 'a little funky', but said that she was 'happy to be sitting in between you guys'. She did however confess that she was 'feeling a little lonely' in the studio and missing her 'partner in crime'. 'Things look a little different, I feel a little lonely here, I'm missing my partner in crime, she's usually six feet away here!' Hoda joked. For his part, Al, 65, seemed more than happy with his at-home set-up, telling his two co-stars that he had 'just got the coffee maker going'. 'It is very weird I will admit, but... venturing out, making sure you keep that physical distance, [even though] it's eerie, everybody is practicing what [the experts] are preaching.' Savannah joined Al in urging viewers to follow CDC guidelines for social distancing, noting that she is not showing any of the most serious symptoms connected with the coronavirus, but that she feels it is more important than ever to take extra precautions when feeling unwell. 'I have a sore throat and I have the sniffles,' she explained. 'I didn't even think anything of it, because frankly that doesn't seem to be on the official list of symptoms. 'But what I've been told is number one, doctors are getting new information about this novel coronavirus, it's new, that means we're learning about it and the symptoms that present. 'And the other thing is, if you're sick at all, the CDC is saying this is the time to stay home, and so, I had to admit it, and you know me, I like to come rain or shine and spread my germs around, but we don't do that anymore. We stay home, and we keep everybody safe. 'And like I told you, I think of it as a way of loving your neighbor. Love your neighbor and keep them safe.' One upside to Savannah's new working arrangement is the opportunity to spend more time with her husband, Mike Feldman, who - she revealed on Instagram - has stepped in to serve as a producer and technician while she is working from home. 'Big shoutout to my husband @feldmike who has turned into producer and technician!!' she wrote on Instagram, while sharing an image of Mike sitting on a bed while working away on a laptop. The Today show's new normal comes as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US hit more than 6,300. 103 people are known to have died as a result of the illness."
54,"Coronavirus deaths in Europe now exceed Asia's toll with 3,421 compared to 3,384 as EU chief admits the bloc 'underestimated' the virus",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124993/European-Commission-chief-admits-leaders-underestimated-coronavirus.html,"European leaders 'underestimated' the impact of coronavirus, the EU's top official admitted today as the bloc agreed to shut its borders. Ursula von der Leyen said that 'measures which seemed drastic two or three weeks ago need to be taken now' as much of the continent goes into lockdown. The European Commission chief admitted that the virus 'will keep us busy for a long time', in an interview with Bild which was published today. European leaders are banning travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days to contain the spread of the virus and many governments are taking their own drastic measures. 'I think that all of us who are not experts initially underestimated the coronavirus,' von der Leyen said. 'We understand that measures that seemed drastic two or three weeks ago, need to be taken now,' she added. But she rejected the language of French president Emmanuel Macron, who likened the outbreak to war this week, and ordered almost the entire population to stay at home for at least two weeks. 'I will not personally use that term but I understand the motivation of the French president as the coronavirus is a worrying enemy,' she said. Germany's economy minister Peter Altmaier said the United States under Donald Trump had taken the threat of the virus even more lightly. 'The outbreak of the crisis was probably underestimated even more so in the US than in some countries in Europe,' Peter Altmaier told regional press group Funke. 'That is the reason we very much hope that the US will manage to control the situation, also in our own interest,' he added. 'No-one hopes that the US economy would fall into an uncontrolled recession.' The decision to close borders is the most significant emergency measure yet from the EU, which has scrambled to come up with a unified response to the epidemic. The 27 leaders met by video conference to agree the ban on non-essential travel to the bloc. The idea was strongly backed by France, hoping to persuade member states that they need not close doors to each other. Von der Leyen had proposed the bloc's Schengen passport-free zone impose the measure, a drastic and unprecedented move, and that fellow EU states outside the zone follow suit. The ban will be in effect for an initial period of 30 days and will not affect Europeans returning home, social workers, cross-border workers, or citizens of former EU member Britain. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said states 'agreed to impose an entry ban' into the bloc. 'Germany will implement it immediately,' added the leader of Europe's biggest economy, which had initially closed its national borders. 'This is an exceptional measure that shouldn't last longer than necessary,' Sweden's interior minister Mikael Damberg told a Stockholm press conference. After the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron's office said he had 'firmly condemned uncoordinated measures to control internal EU borders, which are not helpful in terms of health and hurt the economy.' Several EU countries have closed their frontiers or imposed new health screening controls that slow cross-border freight traffic, despite calls from Brussels for a single European plan. Italy, Spain, France and now Belgium have opted for widespread lockdowns, ordering citizens to stay at home for all but essential trips. The Netherlands has taken a looser stance, hoping to build collective immunity. Britain initially took a lighter touch but has ramped up its containment measures in recent days."
55,"Russia has deployed 'significant coronavirus disinformation campaign' against the West to sow panic, the EU says",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125577/Russia-feeding-coronavirus-disinformation-sow-panic-West-EU-document-says.html,"Vladimir Putin is being protected from coronavirus around the clock with all of his staff undergoing mandatory testing, it emerged today. The Kremlin said that all workers involved in the presidents' events schedule were being tested for the disease. Russia has recorded 147 cases of coronavirus so far and the authorities have temporarily barred foreigners from entering the country in an effort to prevent it spreading further. 'Everything needed to protect the president from viruses and other illnesses is being done around the clock,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 'The president's work schedule is public and the best proof of the state of his health.' Peskov has previously declined to say whether Putin has been tested for coronavirus, but has said that the president's medical care is of an exceptionally high level. Putin on Wednesday was visiting Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Journalists travelling with Putin on the trip were tested beforehand to prove they were not carriers of the virus. The Kremlin has also told journalists to stay away if they feel unwell. Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said on Wednesday that he'd been tested for coronavirus himself along with all high-ranking Kremlin officials. It comes as Russian media deployed a 'significant disinformation campaign' against the West to worsen the impact of the coronavirus, generate panic and sow distrust, it was claimed. According to a European Union document, the Russian campaign, pushing fake news online in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French, uses contradictory, confusing and malicious reports to make it harder for the EU to communicate its response to the pandemic. A specialist EU database has recorded almost 80 cases of disinformation about coronavirus since January 22, it said. The EU document cited examples from Lithuania to Ukraine and said that on social media, Russian state-funded, Spanish-language RT Spanish was the 12th most popular news source on coronavirus between January and mid-March, based on the amount of news shared on social media. Yesterday it emerged that Kremlin-backed media has broadcast propaganda which blamed Britain for the outbreak and claimed COVID-19 was created as a tool to benefit of the UK. Igor Nikulin, who claimed to be a microbiologist, said onRussia's Channel 1 he was 'certain' the coronavirus was a 'man-made disease'. The disease was also linked to the Skripal Novichok scandal in which the Salisbury government laboratory at Porton Down was accused by Russian media of using the nerve agent on former Russian military intelligence Sergei Skripal in March 2018. In fresh allegations made this week, the programme claimed the British 'smeared something in Wuhan' in the same way that they 'smear[ed] nerve agent on Skripal's door handle'. The Kremlin denied the allegations made in the EU report today, saying they were unfounded and lacked common sense. 'A significant disinformation campaign by Russian state media and pro-Kremlin outlets regarding COVID-19 is ongoing,' said the nine-page internal document, dated March 16, using the name of the disease that can be caused by the coronavirus. 'The overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries...in line with the Kremlin's broader strategy of attempting to subvert European societies,' the document produced by the EU's foreign policy arm, the European External Action Service, said. Peskov pointed to what he said was the lack in the EU document of a specific example or link to a specific media outlet. 'We're talking again about some unfounded allegations which in the current situation are probably the result of an anti-Russian obsession,' said Peskov. The EEAS declined to comment directly on the report. The European Commission said it was in contact with Google , Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft . An EU spokesman accused Moscow of 'playing with people's lives' and appealed to EU citizens to 'be very careful' and only use news sources they trust. The EU and NATO have accused Russia of covert action, including disinformation, to try to destabilise the West by exploiting divisions in society. Russia denies any such tactics, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused foreign foes of targeting Russia by spreading fake news about coronavirus to whip up panic. Russian media in Europe have not been successful in reaching the broader public, but provide a platform for anti-EU populists and polarise debate, analysis by EU and non-governmental groups has shown. The EEAS report cited riots at the end of February in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic now seeking to join the EU and NATO, as an example of the consequences of such disinformation. It said a fake letter purporting to be from the Ukrainian health ministry falsely stated here were five coronavirus cases in the country. Ukrainian authorities say the letter was created outside Ukraine, the EU report said. 'Pro-Kremlin disinformation messages advance a narrative that coronavirus is a human creation, weaponised by the West,' said the report, first cited by the Financial Times. It quoted fake news created by Russia in Italy, the second-most heavily affected country in the world, that health systems would be unable to cope and doctors would choose who lived or died because of a lack of beds. The EEAS has also shared information with Slovakia over the spread of fake news accusing the country's prime minister, Peter Pellegrini, of being infected with the virus and saying he may have passed on the infection to others at recent summits. EU leaders have been conferring by video-conferences since early March. President Vladimir Putin yesterday claimed the coronavirus was 'under control' in Russia and said outbreaks of infection had been contained as the country closed its borders to foreigners."

Francisco Garcia died unexpectedly in Carlos Haya Hospital, Malaga, on Sunday. His stepfather Juan Fernandez, speaking on his own behalf as well as that ofFrancisco's mother Irene Gomez, has since described the football coach's final few days. Mr Fernandeztold the Sun Onlinethat Francisco had started to feel unwell on March 6 but dismissed the symptoms as the onset of a common cold. He decided to go to the GP three days later on March 9 when he continued to suffer with a sore throat. Doctors advised Francisco to take paracetamol and he was sent home after being told that there was no need to worry. But Francisco's condition continued to worsen. Mr Fernandez took him to a health centre the following day, where he was given antibiotics and sent home once again. By the next day Francisco could no longer stand up properly and he had developed a fever, which prompted his parents to take him to hospital. He was diagnosed with pneumonia later that day but his family were refused access to him as he remained in quarantine while awaiting a test for coronavirus. The results eventually came back as positive and doctors also said that they had detected leukaemia in Francisco's blood. Mr Fernandez added:'We knew coronavirus was killing people - but we never thought it would kill Francis. 'We were told he had died on Sunday. All we had over those four days was telephone contact with the hospital. 'We couldn't speak to Francis, we didn't see him and we couldn't pay our last respects. 'He was taken to the cemetery without us being able to say goodbye to him. 'We can't get our heads around what's happened.A fortnight ago we were a normal family.' The family are now all self-isolating as they fear they may now also have contracted coronavirus. Mr Fernandez warned that Francisco's story is proof that the outbreak must be taken seriously. The Spanish Government has banned people from organising wakes for their loved ones amid the pandemic because of the risk of infection. Francisco's body was incinerated on Monday. There have so far been more than 13,000 reported cases of COVID-19 in Spain which have resulted in 624 deaths. Garcia was the fifth victim of the pandemic in the Malaga region but was by far the youngest with others being in their late 70s and 80s. His pre-existing but undiagnosed leukaemia is said to have affected his ability to fight off the virus, according to local health authorities."
57,'My heart hurts': Stars of Netflix hit Cheer sob uncontrollably as they say their final goodbyes after their season was brought to an abrupt end because of coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8127191/Netflix-Cheer-stars-left-tears-final-practice-coronavirus-ended-season.html,"The stars of hit Netflix series Cheers were dealt a devastating blow when their season was brought to a sudden end as a result of the coronavirus - and now the young cheerleaders have shared their heartbreak with the world after saying their final goodbyes to one another. In a series of emotional Instagram posts, some of the show's best known faces opened up about their grief at watching their competition season come to an end before they had the chance to compete at this year's National Championships in Daytona - which were called off earlier this week. 22-year-old Morgan Simianer, one of the most-loved stars of the hit series, took to social media to share images and videos from the team's final practice, many of which show the cheerleaders sobbing hysterically. At the same time, the talented athlete seemed to suggest that she will not cheer again after finishing up her time at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. 'Navarro College Cheer, you are my everything,' she wrote on Instagram. 'My heart hurts that I wonâ€™t cheer again. 'I'm so thankful for the bonds Iâ€™ve created and the memories that Iâ€™ll carry with me forever. Thank you for shaping me into the person I am today. Thank you for providing a family for me and showing me all that this life has to offer.' She concluded: 'Iâ€™m going to miss everything about this. The program. The people. Everything,' before signing off with the team's slogan, FIOFMU. Morgan then added on Twitter: 'My heart hurts, at least I have these people with me for the rest of my life.' Images shared by the cheerleader and her teammates show Morgan, TT Barker, Shannon Woolsey, and Dillon Brandt holding one another while crying; an additional photo shows the foursome posing with their beloved coach Monica Aldama. On her Instagram Stories, Morgan also shared videos of the team having their final huddle, in which they are all seen holding hands as someone off camera can be heard saying through tears: 'God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.' The team were heard saying the prayer regularly throughout the Netflix show after practices and competitions, however fans will no doubt find this clip far more poignant and emotional given the circumstances. Jerry Harris, another one of the most popular stars on the show, shared a team image on Instagram, showing all of the cheerleaders gathered together in the gym for the final time. 'My family forever and always,' he wrote. 'This isn't a goodbye... it's a see you soon.' Shannon meanwhile took to Twitter to share her feelings, writing: 'Spending your last and final year working so hard just to get it all taken away. 'I love you guys so much and I'm so happy we got to spend our last year together. 'And to the others that couldn't be here today, I love you guys forever. BT3CHR - best rookie class ever.' Earlier this week, many of the team members shared their devastation at the news that the National Championships in Daytona, Florida, had been canceled. Varsity Spirit issued a statement canceling all future events for 'at least the next eight weeks of the 2020 competition,' much to the dismay of the cheerleaders at Navarro College. The organization wrote: 'As you may have seen, the CDC just announced their recommendation to cancel or postpone events with 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. 'With that recommendation, we have made the decision to not proceed as planned with scheduled events for at least the next eight weeks of the 2020 competition season.' The events previously scheduled include the NCA and NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance National Championship. The release included: 'We are actively exploring all options, including rescheduling events, extending the competition season, and hosting virtual competitions, to continue to provide a competition experience for the thousands of athletes who have worked so hard this year to compete.' Cheerleader La'Darius Marshall wrote that the cancellation of the premier competition 'isn't goodbye' for the cheer squad. 'Daytona you will be missed and greatly appreciated,' he wrote on Instagram. 'I love everyone one of my teammates and all the love we shared. 'The end of my cheerleading career has come a bit early. For everyone who supported me all this way I want to say thank you and I love you. Iâ€™m heartbroken for my team and coaches.' Coach Monica responded in the comments, writing: 'My heart is breaking!!!! I love you forever!!!!' Dillon admitted that he was sad the season had to com to a close so soon, but was hopeful for the future as he shared a photo from last year's competition when the team won and celebrated with an ocean dive including the trophy. 'Daytona is officially cancelled....as it breaks my heart to type this out.....itâ€™s over,' he wrote. ' This amazing year has come to an end, but no matter what the dreams donâ€™t stop here, Iâ€™m truly thankful for everything that has come from this...Dawgs are forever.' Shannon shared in her sorrow and joy of being on the squad despite trying times. 'As I'm typing this with uncontrollable tears running down my face, i canâ€™t help but think about how bad i just want one more performance with navarro cheer,' she wrote. 'The amount of love i have for this program is indescribable. 'I canâ€™t wrap my head around daytona being cancelled and the season ending way too early, but College cheerleading you did me extremely well & i will miss you more than anything. 'To all the newbies coming to navarro in the future, treasure the time you have there, you will NEVER get anything like it again.' The Navarro cheer squad claims 14 National Championships in the last two decades in addition to five NCA Grand National Championships since 2012; the team became a household name after their Netflix documentary was released earlier this year."
58,Venice's canals are the cleanest they've been in living memory after coronavirus lockdown leaves water clear and fish become visible,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125107/Venices-canals-cleanest-theyve-living-memory.html,"Venetian canals are the clearest they have been in living memory after Italy's coronavirus lockdown stopped boats from bringing sediment to the surface. In a rare welcome side-effect of the health crisis, the usually murky waterways are clear enough to see the schools of fish under the water. White swans are also roaming the canals in a city where the usually overloaded piazzas and alleyways have become almost deserted, while air pollution has declined across northern Italy. With no tourists taking gondola rides along the canals, the sediment in the water has been able to settle at the bottom without being churned about - making the surface clearer. One Venetian local, Marco Capovilla, said he 'had never seen' the water so clear after filming some of the fish under the surface. 'The water now looks clearer because there is less traffic on the canals, allowing the sediment to stay at the bottom,' a spokesman for the Venice mayor's office told CNN. 'It's because there is less boat traffic that usually brings sediment to the top of the water's surface.' 'The air, however, is less polluted since there are less vaporetti and boat traffic than usual because of the restricted movement of residents.' Local resident Capovilla, 40, described the 'striking' clarity of the water in contrast to the usually dirty canals, which he filmed during the lockdown. 'The city doesn't have sewers, so normally everything goes into the canals, including detergents and cosmetics,' the estate agent said. 'Thanks to the quarantine, we are experiencing a cleaner environment.' Bank worker Martina Bettoni, 33, said: 'Seeing so many fish in the canals was extremely rare before the quarantine. 'I hope we'll learn from this tragic time, and that when this is over Venice will be able to strike a balance between tourist crowds and cleanliness.' Images from aEuropean Space Agency-backed programme have already shown pollution in sharp decline over northern Italy. They include significant reductions in NO2 levels in Venice and other major Italian cities such as Milan, Turin and Bologna. There are also signs of falling NO2 levels in Rome, although the quarantine measures have not been in place for so long there. TheCopernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service said nitrogen oxide levels appeared to have fallen by around 10 per cent in the last four weeks. 'Most of its emissions sources are located at the surface and are generated by human activities such as traffic, production of energy, residential heating, industries,' the group said. However, they warned that some sources of pollution could increase. For example, people may use private cars more often to avoid public transport. Venice landmarks such as St Mark's Square have become almost deserted with gondolas empty in a reversal of the city's usual overcrowding problem. Last month's Carnival was cancelled, flights have been scrapped, borders are closing and foreign governments are advising against travel to Italy. Health workers have been seen spraying streets, swimming pools, plazas, pavements and bridges in what the local council describes as 'exceptional measures'. The city is usually one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, attracting more than a million visitors from China alone last year. But the Venice tourist industry had already suffered a blow last year when 'apocalyptic' floods ravaged the lagoon city. The head of the Veneto region which includes Venice has said virus tests will be ramped up from 3,000 to more than 11,000 per day. 'Even if we find just one positive case, it means we will have 10 less infections,' said Luca Zaia. 'I don't really care about the budget. It is less important than the lives of our citizens.' The governor has called on 'everyone to remain in isolation' to avoid putting hospitals under further strain. 'If you do not follow the rules, the healthcare system will crash and I will have to impose a curfew,' Zaia said. Meanwhile, with fewer ships and ferries around Cagliari, Sardinia, locals have been treated to the sight of dolphins swimming up alongside a dock. And as people increasingly shelter indoors, wild boar have been seen roaming around the streets of Sassari on the island."
59,THREE British babies catch coronavirus in space of week: Another infant tests positive and is kept in isolation after nine-month-old boy and newborn also get killer diseaseÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125061/Baby-tests-positive-coronavirus-Norfolk-hospital.html,"A third British baby has tested positive for Covid-19and is now in isolation with two other patients. Health officials at the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk, said a baby is among three new cases identified - and all patients are now being treated in isolation. A hospital spokesman said: 'An extensive ''contact tracing'' exercise is now under way by Public Health England to trace anyone who might have had close (face-to-face) contact. 'Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and what to do if they become unwell in the 14 days after they had contact with the confirmed case.' The infant is one of three to have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week - along with a newborn child in London and a nine-month-old in Manchester. Babies have been infected around the world but they do not appear to be any more susceptible to the deadly virus than adults. Babies also don't appear to get the virus as intensely as adults or even older children, doctors say. The nine-month-old was diagnosed with coronavirus despite neither parent feeling unwell. Myroslava Coates told Sky News she took her son Cassian to see a doctor in Manchester on Monday after he developed a fever, and they were told he had tested positive. She said: 'We weren't expecting that. Cassian had a fever and cold but not the cough and symptoms everyone was talking about. 'We were told to go home to self-isolate for two weeks and keep giving him Calpol as if it was a cold.' At the weekend, a mother and her newborn baby tested positive. The infant was believed to be the youngest patient to have been diagnosed in the UK. The mother was rushed to hospital days earlier with suspected pneumonia and she and her child are being treated at separate hospitals, The Sun reported. The newspaper said the woman was tested at North Middlesex Hospital but the result was not known until after the birth. Chinese health officials carried out the biggest ever study on the never-before-seen strain of the virus, using data from 72,000 cases. Results showed the SARS-CoV-2 virus posed the greatest threat to older patients and those with underlying conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. It also revealed the exact breakdown of the cases that had been confirmed. AGE 0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+ CASES (%) 416 (0.9%) 549 (1.2%) 3,619 (8.1%) 7,600 (17.0%) 8,571 (19.2%) 10,008 (22.4%) 8,583 (19.2%) 3,918 (8.8%) 1,408 (3.2%) And what about deaths?

Now aworried Sheffield father has issued a warning to others after his three-year-old daughter was struck down with suspected coronavirus. Alarm bells rang when Bella Tyler became 'more than just under the weather' before her temperature soared to over 40C. This prompted her worried parents Nick Tyler, 35, and Bethany Harrison, 25, to phone 111 and although they were told they could not get Bella tested for coronavirus, they were informed that there was a 'high probability' that she has COVID-19. The parents were initially worried when their son Jayden, who is four, developed a cough on Friday. However, his symptoms soon disappeared before Bella's condition began to worsen. Mr Tyler, who lives in Dinnington, Sheffield, with his family, said: 'Bella wasn't herself and on Sunday she developed the same cough Jayden had had on Friday so we decided we would give her overnight and see if it cleared up but it didn't. 'The cough then got a bit more frequent so we rang her school up and let them know. Her temperature then rose on Monday as the day went on and it peaked at 40.3C which is worryingly high for a child. 'Normally if a child is over 40C you take them straight to A&E but now we're being fed that much contradictory information you don't know what to do. 'We rang 111 and I told the chap on the phone about her symptoms and went into more depth and he said there is a high probability that she has coronavirus but he said that they were so under pressure with the testing that as of last night they were only testing over-65s. 'In the meantime, we've just got to assume she has got it.' Mr Tyler says that since yesterday Bella's cough has 'worsened considerably' and she looks as if she has come down with the flu. The family have since taken the decision to self-isolate in their home but Mr Tyler is also worried about his partner who is five months pregnant. He said: 'Bella just wants to sleep all day which is unlike her as she is usually so active. 'It is worrying knowing that they won't do any testing for Bella but she is a healthy kid and I'm concerned for Beth too as I've been told coronavirus can cause pneumonia and premature birth. 'We discussed what to do because we live in a three-bedroomed house with two children so it's big enough but we still only have so many rooms. 'We wondered at first if Beth should go to her mum's but then you've got to commit to that for the full time so we were spitballing ideas and then when Bella's condition worsened there was no way she would have left her.' After their scare with Bella, Mr Tyler wants to warn others about some of the myths surrounding the typical symptoms of coronavirus. He said: 'People are getting it so, so wrong and I've heard many people say ''she can't have it because she has a runny nose''. 'Two of the main symptoms are a cough and temperature but it's a strain of flu. If you have got a bit of diarrhoea or a runny nose don't just ignore it. 'It's such a new thing that symptoms are still developing and every day we are learning something different about it so we have to try and evolve with it.' A newborn baby in London, a nine-month-old infant in Manchester and baby in Norfolk have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week. It is not yet know exactly how the babies caught the coronavirus, but the newborn is thought to have caught the bug moments after it was born to a mother with the virus.  Only 2.4 per cent of reported cases in China occurred in children and only 0.2 per cent involved critical illness. There have been no reports of children dying from COVID-19. To protect children from COVID-19 the advice is to follow the same guidelines recommended for protecting anyone. The CDC recommends teaching children to was their handsoften using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and avoid those who are sick. They also advise parents to clean and disinfect often-touched surfaces like tablets, chairs, doorknobs and light switches daily, and washing items including plush toys as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Symptoms of COVID-19 in infants appear to be milder than in adults but they are able to pass it on to other people. If your child is healthy, there is no need for them to wear a facemask, according to the CDC. In a study published in Frontiers in Pediatrics Chinese doctors found that babies could not contract the disease in the womb. Four babies born in Wuhan, while it was the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, did not show any signs of infection after routine testing. A related study also found that babies born by C-section â€“ an operation that cuts a hole in the womb to deliver the baby â€“ may be less likely to catch coronavirus from an infected mother. 'To avoid infections caused by perinatal and postnatal transmission, our obstetricians think that C-section may be safer,' study author Yalan Liu said. 'Only one pregnant mother adopted vaginal delivery because of the onset of the labour process. The baby was normal. Maybe vaginal delivery is OK. It needs further study.' Babies have been infected around the world with COVID-19 but they do not appear to be any more susceptible to the deadly virus than adults. A newborn baby in London, a nine-month-old infant in Manchester and baby in Norfolk have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week. Doctors don't know exactly how the UK babies caught COVID-19, but in the case of the newborn baby it is thought to have happened moments after it was born to a mother with the virus. Babies also don't appear to get the virus as intensely as adults or even older children, doctors confirmed. Of reported cases in China, where the virus started, only 2.4 per cent of cases occurred in children and only 0.2 per cent involved critical illness. There have been no reports of children dying from COVID-19. 'Old people, their bodies have just taken more bruising over the years of living on this planet,' said infectious disease expert said Dr David Kimberlin. 'Their lungs might be less flexible than a child's lungs. They just get more sick from various pulmonary illnesses,' he said. 'My guess is that children are infected with this virus and they just handle it better because their bodies are more resilient,' he told US News.  It is possible that newborns may not have the same reduced symptoms as older babies - as they are particularly vulnerable to infection, say doctors. 'This is a new virus and we do not know enough yet about how it affects children or pregnant women,' said Unicef. 'We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there have been relatively few cases of COVID-19 reported among children.' To protect children from COVID-19 the advice is to follow the same guidelines recommended for protecting anyone.

Elderly people are the most at-risk of developing severe coronavirus, but experts warn young, healthy people are still dying from the respiratory infection. Globally, more than 198,000 people throughout 167 countrieshave been infected with COVID-19. Of those, some 7,989 people have died. Most fatalities have been people who are elderly or suffer underlying conditions, butBruce Aylward, who assessed the pandemic in China - where the outbreak originated - said there are an alarming number of young people who have developed complications from the disease. Dr Aylward spoke at an Australian health conference earlier this month where he said people as young as 30 were dying from the virus. 'I would emphasise that there were a lot of people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, who were dying as well,' he said. 'People who did have comorbid conditions had a much higher ratio of dying from the disease, but in most people there were no other predictors, apart from age, that they could die.' The University of Technology's respiratory infectious diseases expert, Brian Oliver, argued deaths in young people tended to be higher in China than the rest of the globe. 'What happened in China doesn't seem to be playing out in quite the same way elsewhere. In terms of younger people being susceptible, it seemed to be happening a lot more in China but not so much elsewhere and I don't quite understand that,' he said. He described coronavirus - as with any newly diagnosed infection - as a 'little like a lottery'. 'Because we haven't had these infections before, how our body responds to it is completely unknown... There's always going to be people who have no apparent risk factors and do very badly.' China, Italy and Iran have experienced the highest mortality rates regarding the illness. But other parts of Europe, particularly Germany, France and Spain, as well as the United States and South Korea, have experienced an exponential hike in cases in recent days. Experts fear Australia is currently two weeks behind most of the globe regarding the coronavirus pandemic - meaning it is likely cases have not yet peaked. There are currently at least 561 confirmed coronavirus cases in Australia - including six people who died from the illness. Some medical professionals fear this number could soar past 150,000."
60,Washington doctor warns 'we don't have the resources' to deal with coronavirus peak as hospital RUNS OUT of ventilators and staff are forced to wash and reuse face masksÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126007/Washington-doctor-warns-ventilators-needed-coronavirus-peak.html,"A doctor in Washington State has spoken out about the urgent need for ventilators, protective gear for medical staff and space for sick patients, warning 'we don't have the resources' to deal with the peak of the coronavirus in the United States. Dr. Stephen Anderson, an emergency physician at the MultiCare Auburn Medical Center in suburban Seattle, spoke to Good Morning America on Wednesday, describing the scenes on the front lines for medical staff who are already running low on life-saving resources. He warns that he has only a two-day supply of protective masks left while a hospital up the street had already run out of ventilators that morning. President Trump has advised states to attempt to find more ventilators on their own before seeking help from federal government. The news comes as a top U.S. cancer hospital revealed it hadjust one week's supply of masks left after five staff members and three patients tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday. Scroll down for video 'If this peaks early and it peaks hard, we don't have the resources for this and we'll run out of ventilators and space,' Dr. Andersontold ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos. 'There's no question, we need quicker and more tests, we certainly need more space to place people, we need ventilators,' Anderson continued. 'I have ventilators this morning, but the hospital up the street from me is out of ventilators at the moment.' President Donald Trump said states needing respirators, masks and other equipment for medical professionals should first try to acquire the items on their own before turning to the federal government for help. The American Medical Association sent a letter to Pence on Tuesday expressing concerns about the supply shortage and urging him to launch a 'Manhattan Project'-style effort to expand manufacturing of masks, gowns and other gear. 'The AMA continues to hear from physicians across the country about short supplies and limited access to personal protective equipment, which is necessary to keep the health care workforce safe and to protect the health of patients,' the letter said. 'Physicians are reaching out to their state and local health departments, but their supplies of PPE are also inadequate.' Dr. Anderson also revealed that there is an urgent need for protective gear for staff members in his hospital as he guards his own face mask because the hospital only has a two-day supply remaining. 'I've got my mask for today right here and I'm guarding it with my life because it could be my life. We reportedly have two days' supply,' he told Good Morning America. 'We really don't have a deep bullpen. If people get sick and they're out, that takes people off the frontlines to help with this. But by the same token, you don't want to be sick and be around the people that are coming to the emergency department who are already the sickest people in most need in America. 'So we are trying to test our health care workers as quickly and efficiently as we can and getting them back in the ballgame, if possible.' In the hospital, based in the area of Seattle that's been hardest-hit, some nurses in emergency departments are washing and reusing surgical masks, gloves and gowns. They may work on a patient for hours or more before learning they tested positive for COVID-19. The death toll in the U.S. from COVID-19 passed the 100 mark on Tuesday, and Washington state accounts for more than half of those fatalities. Anderson said 'there's a lot of stress' among medical professionals right now, decribing the moodf as 'frighterning'. 'In 35 years of practice, I can say that this is the most anxiety that I have ever seen around the idea of an infectious disease,' he said. 'We are on the frontlines and it's scary, that's where the casualties always happen in any battle.' Many hospitals also lack the more efficient N95 respirator masks, which quickly sold out once the virus reached the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday urged construction companies to donate any N95 masks - which they use to protect workers from fumes - to their local hospitals. The federal government has sent some extra masks and other equipment to the state, though it's unclear when it will be distributed. On Tuesday,Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York City, one of the country's top cancer hospitals revealed that it hadjust one week's supply of masks left aftereight patients and staff members were diagnosed with the coronavirus. BuzzFeed News reported that Sloan Kettering's senior vice president of supply chain and sustaining care, Kreg Korford, told employees that reason supply is low is production. The majority of the hospital's personal protective equipment (PPE) is made in China - the epicenter of the outbreak - and there are currently production and distribution delays in the Asian country. 'It's been a couple of months since new shipments have come,' Koford said, according to a transcript of a staff meeting last Friday, obtained by BuzzFeed News. 'Their manufacturing is coming back online, but we will not likely see that for four to eight weeks.' A hospital spokesperson confirmed the shortage and said administrators are working to find more supplies. This week, a 40-year-old emergency room physician at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland was in critical condition after testing positive for COVID-19, officials said. Anderson said that physician was breathing on a ventilator, but was stable. A nearby nursing home Life Care Center has been the epicenter of the outbreak in Washington state, and many of its residents who got sick from COVID-19 were sent to EvergreenHealth. The hospital has handled more than 100 coronavirus cases since the end of February, and 25 of those patients died, the facility said Tuesday. A physician at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle also has tested positive for the coronavirus, hospital spokesman Brian Donohoe said Tuesday. He did not immediately have information on the doctor's condition. Elsewhere, a 70-year-old emergency physician from Patterson, New Jersey, tested positive for the coronavirus and was isolated in the intensive care unit, according to William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. 'I am deeply saddened by this news, but not surprised,' Jaquis said in a statement. 'As emergency physicians, we answer the call to care for our most vulnerable, even at great personal risk.' Anderson noted some infections among ER doctors and nurses are inevitable because of their high risk of exposure. 'In any battle, when you're on the front lines, you're going to suffer the most causalities,' Anderson said. 'The emergency departments are the front lines.' Anne Piazza, with the Washington State Nursing Association, said the proper equipment is critical, especially since nurses can be exposed to infected patients before they're even tested for the disease. 'I'm hearing reports from nurses being asked to reuse masks,' Piazza said. 'They have to use the same mask throughout their shift. That's unsafe.' Like many U.S. hospitals, the MultiCare Auburn Medical Center has begun screening arriving patients for the coronavirus, then dividing them into those with respiratory ailments and those with things like broken toes or other injuries, Anderson said. The doctors and nurses treat the patients while waiting for the results of the COVID-19 tests. If they're positive, they put on a mask and are moved to a more secure location. The process is similar at Providence Sacred Heart in Spokane, which serves a large area of eastern Washington. When patients test positive for COVID-19 there, they're moved to the Special Pathogens Unit, which is designed to handle people with infectious diseases. Medical staff in that unit wear suits that include hoods with a separate oxygen source, a full face shield and gown. Anderson said his hospital does not have a special pathogens unit. Instead, it uses four 'negative pressure' rooms to isolate patients with infectious diseases. They're full, he said. And so are his facility's ventilators. The federal government has sent Washington state more than 500,000 N95 respirators and a similar amount of masks, along with gowns and gloves. The equipment is being dropped at the Washington Army National Guard's site called Camp Murray, said Mike Faulk, a spokesman for the governor's office. But it wasn't clear when it would be distributed. Health department officials did not immediately respond to a request for that information. They won't last long once released, Anderson said. 'You'd be surprised how fast you'll burn though a half a million masks,' he added. Anderson used to own an N95 mask, but his disappeared a month ago so he makes due with a simple surgical mask, even when doing procedures on infected patients. 'I would love to go to Home Depot and buy one,' he said. 'That's where we used to get them. Painters use them. But they're all sold out.'"
61,"Furious Johnny Depp tore off Amber Heard's nightgown, pinned her to a ping pong table and grabbed her breasts during late night bust-up, London High Court libel battle hearsÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126559/Depp-tore-Heards-nightgown-pinned-table-grabbed-breasts-High-Court-hears.html,"Johnny Depp tore off Amber Heard's nightgown and mocked her while grabbing her breasts, the High Court heard today. The 56-year-old Hollywood star allegedly pinned the 33-year-old actress against a ping-pong table and strangled her in Australia on March 4, 2015. During a furious row the tip of his finger was cut, and he texted his doctor asking what to do. He has claimed Ms Heard caused the injury and put a cigarette out on his face. But texts aired in court today for the first time reveal he texted his doctor, David Kipper, on 7 March and 19 March 2015. He said: 'I cut the tip of my middle finger off. What should I do? Except of course go to hospital. 'I am so embarrassed for jumping into anything with her. F**K the world. JD..' Then 12 days later he sent text message to Dr Kipper: 'Thank you for everything. I have chopped off my left middle finger as a reminder that I should never cut my finger off again. 'I love you brother, Johnny.' Mr Depp was represented at the hearing in central London but one of his lawyers, Kate Wilson, is self-isolating amid the coronavirus scare. The Pirates of the Caribbean star is currently staying in his palatial chateau in the South of France with his barrister David Sherborne, while Ms Heard is in Los Angeles. Both were said to be very eager to start the trial on Monday 23 March, but Mr Justice Nicol voiced concerns about numerous lawyers, and press sharing the same courtroom. Adam Wolanski, QC, representing The Sun and their columnist Dan Wootton in the libel battle with the actor described the events of March 4, 2015. He said: 'That night the complainant shoved Ms Heard into a ping-pong table, threw bottles through window panels of a glass door, then grabbed Ms Heard and tore off her nightgown. 'The complainant grabbed Ms Heard by her neck and choked her against the refrigerator. 'The complainant mocked her, while touching and grabbing her by her breasts and repeatedly shoved her up against the refrigerator. 'The complainant then grabbed Ms Heard by the neck and collarbone, slammed her against the counter-top and strangled her.' In early 2013 the court heard there was another fight between the now divorced couple in which Mr Depp fell to his knees and began crying blaming a 'monster' living within him. On 15 December last year Ms Heard made a witness statement about the row. Mr Wolanski summarising the statement said: 'He said he was sorry, and he wouldn't do it again. He thought he had killed that other person. The monster as he called it. He said it was sickness. 'He would blame his actions on a self-created third person.' Justice Nicol ruled evidence from two psychiatrists Mr Depp used would now have to be disclosed to The Sun. The actor spoke to Dr Amy Banks over skype twice costing Â£1,000 and also consulted Dr Alan Baulstein between 2012 and 2016. In a statement, a spokesman for Ms Heard said: 'Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order from a judge in 2016. 'Four years later, Mr Depp has dragged her to give evidence to a court in London and subjected her to trial by media. As today showed, the evidence in court will ultimately speak for itself.' The libel claim against NGN and Mr Wootton arises out of publication of an article in The Sun in April 2018, under the headline 'Gone Potty - How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife-beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?' Mr Depp has brought separate libel proceedings against Ms Heard in the US, which the court has previously heard are 'ongoing'. Mr Depp and Ms Heard met on the set of 2011 comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. In May 2016, Ms Heard obtained a restraining order against Mr Depp after accusing him of abuse, which he denied. The couple settled their divorce out of court in 2017, with Ms Heard donating her seven million US dollar (Â£5.5 million) settlement to charity. Depp's lawyers disputed the accuracy of the events which were said to undermine his case, saying the judge was misled and adding: â€œWhat the court heard today was not evidence.""  "
62,"Harvey Weinstein 'coerced actress into having sex with him after proclaiming himself the ""King of Hollywood"" and threatening to blacklist her from the film industry,' new lawsuit claims",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8127063/Lawsuit-claims-Harvey-Weinstein-coerced-actress-having-sex-blacklisting-threat.html,"Harvey Weinstein is facing a civil lawsuit in Los Angeles accusing him of coercing an actress into having a sexual encounter with him by enticing her with a film role and threatening to 'blacklist' her from Hollywood if she were to reject his advances. The newly filed civil complaint accuses the disgraced movie mogul of sexual assault and battery stemming from an incident that took place at the high-end Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills in 2014. Weinstein, who was sentenced last week to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault, this morning was transferred from the notorious Rikers Island jailto the high-security Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York. The plaintiff in the lawsuit obtained by TMZ, known only by the generic pseudonym Jane Doe,claims that she first met Weinstein at an event in Los Angeles in 2014, at which time the Miramax co-founder allegedly boasted to her, 'I run Hollywood,' before inviting her to a followup meeting. Scroll down for video The complaint goes on the say that the actress and Weinstein were set to meet in the lobby of the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, but the Shakespeare in Love producer did not come down, instead inviting her up to his suite. According to the lawsuit, Weinstein met the woman at the door wearing a bathrobe without a belt. During their conversation, Weinstein allegedly called himself the 'King of Hollywood,' told the actress she would be perfect for several movie projects, and urged her to be smart about being nice to the right people in the industry. Later, Weinstein excused himself to go the the bathroom. The lawsuit states that when the woman heard the shower running, she exited the hotel room. Sometime after that first meeting, Jane Doe says in the complaint that Weinstein sent her a script for a film and demanded a second-face-to-face meeting at the same hotel. When she went up to Weinstein's room for what she thought would be a business meeting, according to the court filing, the producer again met him in a bathrobe. This time, their conversation took a menacing tone when the powerful movie mogul allegedly threatened to derail the actress' fledgling career if she were to reject him. Jane Doe says she felt cornered and submitted to Weinstein's demands. The lawsuit alleges that during their sexual encounter, the married father-of-five had the woman call him 'king.' The woman, who is suing for unspecified damages, says in the complaint that in the wake of her encounter with the married film producer, she fell into a depression, suffered a mental breakdown and started losing her hair. Weinstein's spokesperson told TMZ on Wednesday his legal team is reviewing the new allegations outlined in the lawsuit. Weinstein, who turns 68 tomorrow,was convicted in February of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree, while being cleared of predatory sexual assault charges. He was convicted of raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013 and of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006. Nearly 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek, have leveled sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein. Weinsteinhad received treatment at a hospital following his sentencing on March 11 after complaining of chest pains. "
63,Harvey Weinstein is on his way to Fishkill prison in upstate New York after spending just days in the notorious Rikers Island - where a guard tested positive for coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126481/Harvey-Weinstein-way-Fishkill-prison-upstate-New-York.html,"Harvey Weinstein has left the notorious Rikers Island prison and is finally being transferred to a state prison. The disgraced film mogul is being sent to the Downstate Correctional facility in Fishkill, New York. The site is about 60 miles north of New York City and is the processing center for new inmates. Weinstein could remain there or could be taken to another facility. However Fishkill was one of the two places that his lawyers requested he serve his 23 year sentence. Weinstein, 67, was found guilty of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress. Since his conviction on February 24 Weinstein has shuttled between Rikers and Bellevue Hospital because he has been experiencing palpitations and had high blood pressure. He spent the last two days at Rikers before being taken to Fishkill, which houses 1,800 inmates. The other facility that Weinstein could be taken to is the Mohawk Correctional Facility in Rome. Weinstein won't be eligible for conditional release with good behavior until 2039, legal experts have said. He faces four separate charges of rape and sexual assault in Los Angeles where the district attorney has vowed to extradite him to face trial. Fishkill has a range of programs that may be of benefit to Weinstein such as counseling and anger management services. The prison is built on land originally bought for the construction of the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane which was constructed in 1892 - some of the buildings are still in use. Weinstein likely chose it because it houses the Regional Medical Unit which can cater to his back problems, diabetes and eye issues for which he has to have regular injections. Fishkill is also one of six prisons that takes part in the Puppies Behind Bars program, where inmates raise guide dogs and service dogs for wounded veterans. Weinstein has already been accused of getting special treatment and not everyone has been happy at the prospect of him getting a place in the medical unit. Jennifer Scaife, executive director of the nonprofit Correctional Association of New York, has said beds are usually for inmates recovering from surgery or about to die. She told the New York Post: 'If he's able to get placed directly into a regional unit, it will be frankly because of his wealth and influence'. Should Weinstein stay at Fishkill he will be in a facility that previous inmates have described as decrepit and dangerous. Prisoner advocates say it is a place where guards routinely abused inmates and in 2015 Samuel Harrell, 30, was killed in what an autopsy said was a homicide. Reports said that Harrell had been beaten by up to 20 guards known as the 'Beat Up Squad' before being thrown down a staircase. In 2013 another prisoner, Kevin Moore, was beaten so badly by guards that he took two months to recover. Ex inmate Daniel Genis wrote on Vice that Fishkill was a 'very easy place to get on 'chemical handcuffs'. He wrote that the 'compound was full of ''droolers'' - men visibly incapacitated by haldol or lithium'. Genis also talked about the 'Beat Up Squad' and said that they 'function as a platoon' and were used to taking down prisoners who had overdosed on synthetic drug K2, the use of which is rampant within the prison.

64,'What a ride the last decade has been': Gisele shares unseen family photos as she bids farewell to life in Boston after husband Tom Brady leaves Patriots forÂ Tampa Bay Buccaneers,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8127307/Gisele-Bundchen-shares-unseen-family-photos-bids-farewell-life-Boston.html,"With her husband Tom Brady understood to be on the verge of signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Gisele BÃ¼ndchen shared an emotional farewell to Massachusetts. â€˜What a ride the last decade has been,â€™ the 39-year-old supermodel captioned a series of Instagram photos on Wednesday. â€˜Boston has been so good to us and will always be in our hearts. We will forever have wonderful memories.â€™ Among the many family photos she shared, the environmental activist began her tribute with a photo of her then three-year-old son Benjamin, now 10, kissing her belly, while she was pregnant with daughter Vivian, now 7. Additional images include their kids, and his son John Moynahan from his past relationship with Bridget Moynahan, with their arms wrapped around each other at Patriots games, planting trees and playing in the snow. The model mom concluded the post with two adorable pictures, one of her kissing her love on the cheek in matching Patriot beanies and a drawing of their blended family all wearing Bradyâ€™s jersey number. The 42-year-old former New England Patriots quarterbackâ€™s surprise departure comes after spending his entire 20-year career with the team that helped earn him six Super Bowls wins, nine AFC titles and three Most Valuable Player awards. Following her husbandâ€™s lead, who posted two goodbyes to the Patriots, the Brazilian beauty added: â€˜Our kids were born and raised there and we have made special friendships to last a lifetime.â€™ As she penned the touching post, the mother-of-two revealed she would miss â€˜the beautiful change of seasons and the rides to the stadium to go cheer for Tom and the Pats.â€™ The Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life author also thanked fans and the â€˜everyone who has been so supportiveâ€™ of her husband and family over the years and their new transition. On Tuesday, Brady took to Instagram to share his own farewell statement, which paid tribute to his fans and teammates as well as Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Bill Belichick, the only coach he's ever played for as a professional. 'Although my football journey will take place elsewhere, I appreciate everything that we have achieved and am grateful for our incredible TEAM accomplishment,' he wrote in social media statement. 'I have been privileged to have had the opportunity to know each and everyone of you, and to have the memories we've created together.' In response to his statement on Instagram, Brady's wife commented: 'Te amo. So much gratitude for all the wonderful experiences and friendships we had in beautiful New England this past few years.' A sixth-round pick in the 2000 NFL Draft, Brady was a backup quarterback until an injury to Drew Bledsoe thrust him into the starter's role in 2001. That season ended with an improbable Super Bowl run and an upset of the heavily favored St. Louis Rams to win the franchise's first NFL title. Brady leaves the Patriots ranking second in NFL history in passing touchdowns (541) and passing yards (74,571). Only 11-time NBA champion and Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell has enjoyed more success in professional sports in the New England area than Brady. According to multiple reports, Brady will sign a new contract with the Buccaneers on Wednesday. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport is reporting that the deal is worth $30 million per season, although the length of the contract is not known. "
65,Confusion over Bernie Sanders as his campaign say he is NOT dropping out of presidential race after Joe Biden sweeps latest primariesÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126153/Bernie-Sanders-assess-campaign-Joe-Biden-sweeps-Illinois-Florida-Arizona.html,"Bernie Sanders campaign manager said Wednesday the socialist 'is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign' after he fell even further behind Joe Biden in three primary elections Tuesday. 'The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,' Faiz Shakir said in a statement, suggesting the Vermont senator isn't in a hurry to make a decision on whether he will drop out of the primary race. During the third mass-voting Tuesday of the presidential primary, Sanders lost all three states that headed to the polls. Instead Biden won the majority of the delegates across Florida, Arizona and Illinois, taking a total of 249 to Sanders' 116. This brought the former vice president even further in the lead with 1,147 delegates to date. Sanders, on the other hand, has 861 delegates and is facing increasing pressure to drop out and clear the way for Biden. Donald Trump used the opportunity to further exploit the division in the Democratic Party. 'The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule,' Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. 'Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters,' he continued. 'Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG' Instead of leaving the race as he continues to slip behind Biden, Sanders has used the coronavirus outbreak to promote his signature issue, universal, government-funded health coverage. Shakir said in his statement that Sanders' 'immediate' focus is instead on 'the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.' Top advisers claim Sanders is considering whether the political landscape will shift as the virus continues to rock the nation. While Sanders' path to the nomination continues to narrow, establishment Democrats are calling on him to drop out in the name of party unity. Biden easily won Florida, Illinois and Arizona over Bernie Sanders on Tuesday, further cementing his position of probable 2020 Democratic nominee further thwarting the democratic socialist. Biden used a webcam speech to thank supporters - and reach out to Sanders' voters telling them 'I hear you,' in yet another attempt to unify the Democratic Party as the Vermont senator remains in the presidential race. 'Sen. Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision - for the need to provide affordable healthcare for all Americans, reduce income inequity that has risen so drastically, to tackling the existential threat of our time - climate change,' Biden said in remarks livestreamed from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. 'Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues,' the former vice president said. 'Together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country.' Biden then spoke to those supporters directly. 'So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Sen. Sanders - I hear you, I know what's at stake, I know what we have to do,' the ex-veep said looking into the camera. 'Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and then unify the nation.' Sanders' chance of winning the nomination was all but snuffed out a week ago when he lost in Michigan. But with a quick win in Florida for Biden this Tuesday night, and then in Illinois, and finally in Arizona, the Vermont senator's campaign became essentially dead. In Florida, Biden was leading by almost 40 points all night - and the race was called as soon as the final polling stations in the Sunshine State closed. Despite coronavirus outbreak fears, turnout in Florida among Democratic voters was up, NBC News reported. The state also allowed for early voting. That could spell good news for Democrats in November.But the state also gave President Trump enough delegates to be the Repuublican Party's official nominee, the Trump campaign announced Tuesday night. In Illinois, the home state of Biden's former running mate President Obama, Biden was also up more than 20 points. Super Tuesday III originally had primaries taking place in Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Ohio - but Ohio's governor forced a last-minute postponement of in-person voting there due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The other three states still held primaries for president and other down-ballot races with election officials making changes to decrease the chances of voters and poll workers contracting the virus. 'I want to thank all of the public officials, and the poll workers, who worked closely with the public health authorities to assure safe opportunities for voting,' Biden said during his remarks. 'It's important for us to get through this crisis protecting both the public heatlh and our democratcy,' he added. Biden and Sanders have had to dramaticallycurtail their campaign activity, subbing in technology for the gripping-and-grinning they would be doing on the trail. It hasn't always gone smoothly. 'Am I on camera?' Biden asked during his campaign's first attempt at a virtual town hall, which featured several sound snafus, guests that didn't know they were live and blank screens for seconds at a time. The Sanders campaign has had better luck - he's the candidate that's attracted the bulk of young voters, after all - as the Vermont senator has now held several virtual events. On Tuesday night Sanders spoke before Biden's win in Florida could be made official when all the polls in the state close at 8 p.m. Sanders addressed a livestream audience on his campaign website and didn't mention the votes being counted - he instead talked about some of his ideas on how to right the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The main one was to 'empower Medicare to cover all medical bills' brought on by the coronavirus emergency. 'This isn't Medicare-for-all, we can't pass that right now,' said Sanders, articulating a major political reality. He also said he wanted to see student loan payments paused, farmers taken care of and nutrition programs, like food stamps, expanded so families, the elderly and the disabled don't starve. 'Finally we must make sure that our response to this health and economic crisis is not another money-making opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street,' Sanders said. Leaning into his longtime role as a U.S. senator, Sanders said he'd be taking his list of proposals to Senate Democratic leadership. The Senate is currently working on a third piece of legislation that could include an Andrew Yang-like 'freedom dividend' to help Americans, though Senate Republicans and the White House are hashing out the details before Senate Democrats will get a chance. In a way to make his pitch interactive, Sanders said he wanted feedback from his supporters. 'We need to know what you're experiencing right now,' he said looking into the camera. 'It's hard to write proper legislation if we are not familiar with the kind of pain and problems that people all across this country are facing.' Three previous online events - a 'fireside chat' on Saturday, a 'concert' and a 'rally' on Monday and then apre-debate program the campaign held before Sanders and Biden faced off at the CNN headquarters Sunday night, attracted 5.3 million views the Sanders campaign said Tuesday. 'Our digital organizing infrastructure is unmatched, and in this moment of fear and uncertainty, we are proud to be able to speak directly to Americans and bring art, music and community into their homes,' Sanders' campign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. Sanders' concert Monday night featured music fromJim James of My Morning Jacket,Neil Young, with a hello from his wife, actress Daryl Hannah, and the Free Nationals. James and the Free Nationals performed in an audience-less venue, while Young beamed in from his home. Despite being the more tech-savvy campaign, the delegate math makes it nearly impossible toyank away the Democratic nomination from Biden - who saw the moderate wing of the party coalesce around his candidacy in the wake of his 28.5 point win over Sanders in the South Carolina primary. Biden went on to win 10 of the 14 states that held contests on Super Tuesday. He also won five of the six states that held primaries one week ago, with Sanders only walking away with South Dakota. Michigan, which Biden won by 16.5 points, had been the last, best hope for Sanders to change the momentum in the race. Tulsi Gabbard is also still running for president. A Biden campaign memo from Tuesday said that when the early vote and the vote by mail were included overall turnout in the Super Tuesday III states was roughly on pace in Arizona and Florida with what it was in 2016, and in Illinois when looking at the 2018 midterm numbers. 'Even if after tonight's contests, Biden hasn't significanly increased that lead, Sanders would need to win upcoming elections by an average of 15-20 points to overtake Biden in delegates,' the note said. 'It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Senator Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or close the delegate differential.'  Still, Sanders doesn't seem to be in any hurry to exit the race stage-left. The primary has been eclipsed by the coronavirus crisis and what President Trump is doing from the White House."
66,Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx wins Democratic nomination against three challengers despite outrage over her handling of Jussie Smollett's prosecution,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124653/Cook-County-attorney-Kim-Foxx-wins-Democratic-nomination.html,"Kim Foxx, the Chicago area's top prosecutor, won the Democratic nomination Tuesday against three challengers who zeroed in on her handling of the Jussie Smollett criminal case. The primary race for Cook County state's attorney was one of the most expensive of its kind, particularly with Navy veteran Bill Conway making his first run for public office with millions of dollars in family wealth. He had been running television ads for months questioning her office's controversial decision to drop charges against the 'Empire' actor. The constant attention put Foxx on the defensive on the campaign trail, touting her record on progressive criminal justice reforms. 'There was an effort to make this election about one big case involving a celebrity,' Foxx said in her victory speech. 'The voters have overwhelmingly put that fallacy to rest.' Smollett is accused of staging a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago.Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case, but questions loom about whether she acted improperly for speaking to a Smollett relative and aide to former first lady Michelle Obama before the charges were dismissed. A special prosecutor reinstated the charges last month, which Foxx blasted as political. On the campaign trail, Foxx tried to redirect the attention to her record praised by criminal justice experts, including the work of a conviction integrity unit and reforms to the cash bail system. But she grew increasingly frustrated, referring to the attention on the case as 'B.S.' Still, she led in endorsements and establishment backing. Several super PACS also worked against her opponents, including Conway, a former assistant state's attorney whose $11.5million campaign came mostly from his billionaire father, William Conway, co-founder of the Washington DC-based Carlyle Group. 'This campaign, for me it's been a once-in-a-lifetime experience,' the younger Conway said in a concession speech on Facebook Live. He said he didn't know what was next but he looked forward to continuing his service to the country. The other Democrats running were former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti and former federal prosecutor Donna More. The win all but guarantees Foxx a second term in November, as Cook County is heavily Democratic. She faces Republican Patrick O'Brien, a former assistant state's attorney. Voter Victoria Hamel, 49, of suburban Chicago, cast an early ballot for Foxx, applauding her work to dismiss low-level marijuana convictions as part of the state's new law legalizing recreational marijuana. 'This is really important for her to get elected so we can keep the forward progress,' she said. 'I donÂ´t see why we would want to stop the car, go in reverse and start back over.'"

That's according to a lively debate on an online forum. Travellers taking part been discussing the places they've visited that don't live up to the hype, with 'pretentious' London and 'miserable' Times Square also in the firing line. The discussion started on U.S-based site Reddit after one user, 'u/_CAD3', posed the question: 'What is the most overrated place in the world?' Redditors were quick to name places in the United States. User 'the_willow_witch' wrote: 'Los Angeles. It smells like pee and it takes two hours to get anywhere. Itâ€™s also extremely hot all the time.' While 'Giant_Anteraters added: 'I went to LA for vacation last winter, and somehow, I had this impression that the ""Hollywood Walk of Fame"" meant that it would be a hotspot for celebrities to hang out and ""walk"" down the boulevard. 'So I specifically went to the Walk of Fame to see if I could find some celebrities. And yep, the only people I spotted were strangers handing out CDs.' Another Californian city, San Francisco, was named as overrated by 'shesagoatgirl', who explained: 'It's super expensive to live, streets smell like p***, high taxes, terrible traffic.' One Redditor, 'eDgAR', called out Times Square, saying it was especially overrated on New Year's Eve. He said: 'Went there a few years with my girlfriend, her brother, and his girlfriend. 'It was miserable. We ended up leaving and watching the countdown on TV at a Korean BBQ place and the four of us felt that was a much better experience.' While AngeryOhioan agreed, saying: 'Itâ€™s like physically being in a sketchy website without an adblocker.' Moving over to the Middle East, 'Cody_Garbrandt' berated Dubai saying that it's 'so expensive'. And 'Btafoh5' also named Dubai as overrated, adding: 'And... It's the f***ing desert! Nothing but expensive cars, hotels and f***ing sand everywhere.' When it came to European destinations, 'scenesequel' named the Little Mermaid in Copenhagen as overrated, saying: 'Tourists stampede out there in droves to see it, and most leave disappointed, saying things like, ""It's just a small copper sculpture on a rock in the harbor"".' While 'RayaaSaphyre' said: 'Paris? City of love my a**! I'm French and I don't understand that Paris hype. It's grey, polluted and people living there are a**holes. WTF?' For 'Yargle_of_Uborg', Bruges is not impressive: 'It's pretty, but there's so little to do there.' 'ChrisJamesCostello' berated London, saying: 'It is full of pretentious a**holes who donâ€™t give a damn about anyone but themselves.' And 'Happy_goth_pirate lambasted the English seaside resort of Blackpool. They explained: 'It's a right of passage that every Brit goes there at some point and it's s***. Everyone knows it's s***. 'But nostalgia is a hell of a drug and you forget just how s*** it is, until you go back and go ""oh yeah, this place is s***"". And y'know what, you yearn for that s*** a year later.' While 'backrowmetronome' simply added: 'Everything is overrated and itâ€™s better just to stay home.'"
68,Amanda Bynes 'will likely lose custody of baby to her father' amid her struggles with ongoing mental health issuesÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8127601/Amanda-Bynes-likely-lose-custody-baby-father-amid-mental-health-struggles.html,"The ongoing mental health issues plaguing former child star Amanda Bynes will likely impact her ability to retain custody of her future child. On Tuesday, the 33-year-old indicated on social media that she was pregnantafter sharing an ultrasound picture which she later removed from her Instagram account. Bynes, who is currently undergoing treatment for her issues, 'lacks the mental capacity to take care of the child' and her parents plan to seek a judges ruling to place the baby in proper care, according to The Blast on Wednesday. The outlet reports that Amanda's parents, who control her conservatorship, will file in dependency court to have a judge review their daughter's mental condition and fitness as a parent. Adding that the most likely scenario will see Amanda living with her parents who will have legal custody her child. Amanda's on-again-off-again fiance Paul Michael, who is believed to be the father, will also be able to file for custody. The two reportedly met in AA. Yesterday, an attorney for the actress, David Esquibias, said the star 'is seeking treatment for ongoing mental health issues.' In a statement toPeopleDavid continued: 'Any reports that Amanda is suffering from drug or alcoholaddiction issues are completely false.' Adding: 'We ask for privacy during this time, and for any speculation about her personal life from the public and the media to cease so Amanda can focus on getting better.' Amanda had been residing at a sober living facility but recently checked into a treatment center to continue her care of mental health issues, according to People's source. The same day that her lawyer spoke out, Amanda shared her ultrasound photo which she had captioned: 'Baby on board!' Paul Michael also shared a slideshow of pictures on his Instagram account, including a selfie of himself and Amanda and also a similar ultrasound photo bearing the She's the Man star's name and Tuesday's date on it. He captioned his post, which has also since been removed: 'Baby in the making.' The news comes just a week after the couple claimed their Instagram accounts had been hacked, leading to reports they had split. Paul said to Page Six: 'Both of our Instagrams got hacked and someone deleted our pictures and sent direct messages saying we broke up.' 'We never broke up and weren't able to log into our Instagrams until last night. Assumably [the person wanted] to make it seem like we broke up.' And with reports that the Amanda Show actress refused to go to rehabilitation earlier this month, Paul confirmed it wasn't a hospital and says her trauma is resulting from her childhood and she is also suffering with anxiety. He added: 'She's not ordered to go to a hospital. She's ordered to go to a residential treatment, which is called inpatient, but she's not in a hospital. She is affected by trauma from her childhood.' Adding: 'The anxiety made her drop out of school and the judge ordered her to work on that in residential treatment ... She's allowed to come and go as long as she goes to therapy. She's doing really well, besides anxiety and trauma.' Amanda - who has struggled with substance abuse and legal issues over recent years - could not legally get married without the permission of the judge in her conservatorship case, as well as her mother Lynn. She was reportedly intent on blocking her daughter's proposed marriage to Paul, feeling it wasn't in her best interest to tie the knot."
69,Outrage as video appears to show Louisiana deputy planting crack cocaine on handcuffed suspect,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125939/Video-sparks-outrage-appears-deputy-planting-crack-cocaine-suspect.html,"A cellphone video that appears to show a Louisiana deputy plant a baggie of crack cocaine next to a handcuffed suspect during an arrest has sparked outrage after it was posted online. The nearly 30-second recording was shared on Twitter, Instagram and Redditon Monday, sparking widespread condemnation and accusations of malfeasance directed at the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. But the Jefferson Parish sheriff says the viral footage does not tell the whole story. On Tuesday, Sheriff Joseph Lopinto held a press conference saying that an internal investigation has revealed that the deputy did not plant the evidence at the scene of the arrest, and that the suspect, Dominique Griffin, 26, has expressed remorse for fueling the false accusations against the officer, and for biting his colleague. According to the sheriff, repeat lab tests showed that the white pills seized from Griffin were found to contain methamphetamine, while a search of his phone uncovered evidence of drug trafficking activity.   The incident began unfolding at 3pm on Monday, when deputies responded to a 911 call reporting a man selling drugs in Bridge City. Responding deputies tracked down the suspect, later identified as Griffin, near the intersection of 4th Street and Westwego Avenue. He allegedly resisted arrest and bit one of the deputies before being handcuffed and placed on the ground, which is where the eyewitness video picks up the action. In the video, a man in a red T-shirt is seen laying on his side on the ground with his hands restrained behind his back and yelling at three sheriff's deputies kneeling or standing around him: 'there ain't no crack in that bag... I'm not a crackhead.' A deputy kneeling in front of the detained man, identified as Dominique Griffin, is seen holding a plastic baggie containing a white substance in his right hand. He then shifts the baggie to his left hand. The deputy drops the packet in the grass and picks up another item, prompting Griffin and the woman recording the arrest to exclaim that the cop had just put the baggie item on the ground and to alert him that he was being filmed. 'Sheâ€™s recording!' another woman could be heard yelling off-camera. The deputy looks up, realizes that he is being videotaped and charges at the woman with the phone. 'Get out the way!' another person warns the woman.' Go inside!' The deputy chasing the eyewitness could be heard yelling, 'Your phone is evidence.' As the woman flees, the video abruptly ends. As of Wednesday morning, on Twitter alone the video has been viewed 4.2million times. As news of the footage allegedly showing a deputy plant drug evidence spread, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office released a statement saying the matter was being investigated. 'Our on-scene deputies have been interviewed in this matter and gave reasonable explanations to the actions depicted in the video,' the first statement from the agency read. It also noted that 'the suspected drug evidence recovered on the scene tested negative for narcotics, but was collected nonetheless and was sent to the Crime Laboratory for further testing.' Further tests found it tested positive for methamphetamine. Griffin was initially booked into the county jail on charges of battery on an officer, battery on an officer with injury and resisting arrest with force or violence. After it tested positive for meth, he was charged with two additional counts of drug possession. In the follow-up statement released on Tuesday, the sheriff's office revealed that each responding deputy was interviewed separately, and that all of their accounts remained consistent. 'All maintained that the bag containing pills was removed from the suspectâ€™s pants pocket prior to being placed on the ground and then picked up again, which was depicted in the social media video,' the press release states. As part of the internal investigation, Griffin was also interviewed and detectives executed a search warrant on his phone, which reportedly was found to contain information that connected the suspect to the drugs seized from his pants pocket. Griffin's phone also yielded text messages related to 'the planning and scheduling of his drug sales.' Sheriff Lopinto said during Tuesday's press conference that Griffin has apologized for biting the deputy, and also expressed remorse over the false accusations claiming evidence planting, which he stressed did not come from him, reported WWL. 'I actually have to thank him,' the sheriff said. 'It's not often in law enforcement that we thank the suspects that we arrest. In this case, he showed a lot of remorse.' Lopinto added that Griffin did not want the deputy to get in trouble because 'he knew he did not do anything wrong and took ownership of the drugs that he had on him in that period of time.'"
70,Sony goes head-to-head with Microsoft by revealing PlayStation 5 specs just a day after its rival details the next-generation Xbox Series X,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8127365/Sony-reveals-PlayStation-5-specs-just-day-rival-details-generation-Xbox-Series-X.html,"Sony has finally unwrapped hardware details on its next-generation PlayStation 5 console. In an online event on Wednesday, the company went into detail on its system hardware for the the first time, detailing the specs that will go head-to-head with its biggest rival Microsoft. Among those specs is an eight-core AMD Zen 2 CPU which is capable of 3.5GHz and a custom GPU based on AMDâ€™s RDNA 2 architecture that is capable of 10 teraflops. Like the upcoming Xbox Series X it will also have a solid stat hardrive that will help drastically reduce load times. According to Eurogamer, the PlayStation 5 will also have 16GB of RAM which will aid the promised super-fast loading times in gameplay. In a demo on Wednesday, Sony showed off how new hardware can load games like Spiderman in one second compared to the eight seconds previously needed by the PlayStation 4. Additionally, system architect Mark Cerny showed that the console could load a gigabyte of data in one second as opposed to the PlayStation 4 which took 20 seconds. The system will also come with expandable storage in the form of USB as well as opposed to Xbox which will be able to load in 1 terabyte expansion cards and will have a 4k Blu-Ray drive that supports discs. As noted by The Verge, Microsoft seems to have the edge when it comes to pure specs. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has previously announced that the upcoming console will have 12 teraflop of GPU performance, which is two times more powerful than the latest Xbox One X and four times more powerful than the specs of the original Xbox One. Thanks to a similar solid state hard drive, Microsoft says the Series X will also be able to pause and resume multiple games instantly. As was previously revealed, this means that players will also be able to instantly start playing their favorite games even after a system reboot. Both consoles are expected to be release later this holiday season though neither has a hard release date yet. Cost for both systems is also a major questions mark. According to a report from Bloomberg which cites sources familiar with the matter, the PlayStation 5's use of in-demand flash memory components may increase the cost of manufacturing to $450, meaning the console will likely retail for at least $470. As noted by Bloomberg, the PlayStation 4 - Sony's current iteration of game console - first retailed for $399 and reportedly costs the company about $380 to manufacture."
71,Why the narwhal got its tusk: Male 'unicorns of the sea' use their horns to attract females as well as battle rivals - and the bigger the better,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8125177/Size-matters-Female-narwhals-attracted-males-biggest-tusks.html,"Male narwhals with the biggest tusks are more attractive to females, scientists have discovered. Those with the largest tusks, which are actually overgrown teeth, are also more successful at fending off rival males as they use them as 'sexual weapons'. Researchers studied 245 adult male narwhals and found the largest of the so-called 'unicorns of the sea' haddisproportionately long tusks. The US scientists expected bigger narwhals to have larger tusks than smaller individuals but were surprised at the enormity of the tusks on the very largest males. Scroll down for video The phenomenon of excessive growth of a certain body part is known as hyperallometry and describes excessive development.  According to the team from Arizona State University, having long tusks gives male narwhals anadvantage when looking for a mate or showing aggression towards fellow males. This gives them an edge in the battle for female attention and makes it more likely they will mate. Zackary Graham, a PhD student at Arizona State University's School of Life Sciences, said: 'We suggest that the narwhal tusk is a sexuallyselected signal that is used during the male-male tusking contests. 'The information that the tusk communicates is simple: ""I am bigger thanyou"".' Narwhals, like walruses and elephants, grow tusks. They grow out of the narwhal's head in a spiral pattern and can be be aslong as 8ft, giving the creatures a unicorn-like appearance. Although this trait in mainly seen in males, some females have also beenfound to have tusks. On rare occasions, males have been seen with two tusks. The researchers analysed theshape, size and structure of 245 adult male and measured the whales' bodies, the width of their tails and the length of their tusks. The team found that two males of the same body size can have tusks ofdifferent lengths, varying from as small as 1.5ft to 8.2ft. The narwhal, or narwhale has the largest canines in the animal kingdom. Narwhals, like walruses and elephants, grow tusks, which are actuallymodified teeth. They grow out of the narwhal's head in a spiral pattern and can be be aslong as 8ft, giving the creatures a unicorn-like appearance. Although this trait in mainly seen in males, some females have also beenfound to have tusks. It projects from the left side of the upper jaw, through the lip and forms a left-handed helix. The tusk is hollow and weighs only around 10 kg (22 lb). About one in 500 males has two tusks, which occurs when the right canine, normally small and less straight, grows as well. However, while tusks were highly variable, it was not matched in measurements for tail size. In the study, the majority of the narwhal tails measured between 1.5ft and 3ft. The researchers said the results provide the best evidence to date that narwhal tusks are used to fight off other males or attract mates,as traits determined by sexual selection often show disproportionalgrowth in individuals of the same age. According to the team, this is because many sexual characteristics arehighly sensitive to nutrient and body condition, so only the strongestindividuals have the energy to produce the largest traits. Mr Graham said: 'Overall, our evidence supports the hypothesis that thetusk functions both as a sexually selected weapon and sexually selectedsignal during male-male contests.

The 14 contestants, who are being housed in Cologne, were stunned into silence as they were informed about the worldwide crisis by host Jochen Schropp during a live televised episode, which aired ahead of its regular slot at 7pm on Tuesday evening. The group - who were some of the last people to be informed about the deadly virus - were also given the opportunity to ask questions to the show's resident doctor Dr Andreas Kaniewski, as well as to speak to their loved ones at home. Plans to keep the contestants in the dark unless a relative became ill were overturned following an uproar on social media over the decision. On Tuesday night, from behind a glass screen, host Jochen Schropp and Big Brother resident doctor Dr Andreas Kaniewski broke the news to the housemates. Speaking in German, Jochen said: 'There is currently a lot going on in world events since you entered the house. 'We'd like to inform you as to why we're here and why we're behind a glass screen.' The camera panned around the seating area as the housemates fell into stunned silence as they were brought up to speed on the coronavirus. 'COVID-19 has basically spread across the world in recent days, triggering a global pandemic. 'This is a disease similar to the flu, and is mainly dangerous for older people,' explained Jochen. Easing the contestants' fears, he added: 'We're going to allow you to speak to your families so you can rest easy. And you can communicate with them as they are all okay.' The producers initially defended their first decision not to enlighten the housemates and told local newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung they would only be informedin certain circumstances. But the channel which airs the reality programme - Sat.1 - faced backlash online from viewers who suggested it was unfair not to tell the housemates. Many took to Twitter to air their grievances over the situation. One wrote: 'I read today that contestants on Big Brother, Germany have no idea what's going on in the outside world with the Corona Virus and TV company is debating whether to tell them! What a liberty!' Another penned: 'So are we gonna talk about how the members of Big Brother in Germany currently have no idea about the coronavirus and nobody is allowed to tell them?' A third said: 'There's people in the big brother Germany house who have been their since Feb 6th and they have no idea about coronavirus [mind blown emoji]'. Another impassioned viewer said: 'People on Big Brother Germany, Brazil, Canada haven't been told about Covid-19. 'I've read some f***ed up s***t recently but that is f***ed up.' Show bosses have also insisted that 'special hygiene measures' have been taken to protect the contestants from getting the infection. Most of the housemates entered the show at its inception on February 6, when the global threat of coronavirus seemed unlikely and only cases in Wuhan, China were confirmed. Four more contestants were introduced to the house on March 6, just three days before the country reported its first coronavirus death. The housemates are in total isolation in a purpose-built compound, which is understood to be well supplied with food and essentials. Since the show began, it has only been interrupted in the same way once before, as in 2001 the American version of the show broke the news to contestants about 9/11 when one relative was presumed missing.  Coronavirus was confirmed as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11. They aren't told aboutmajor news events until after they've been eliminated, but an exception was made in this instance. Big Brother contests aren't the only people who were, until very recently, unaware of the pandemic. Jared Leto was left stunned after emerging from a12-day desert retreat to discover the spread of coronavirus has now become a global crisis. The Oscar winner, 48, was shocked to learn that much of the world was taking extreme measures to fight COVID-19, with countless people self-isolating at home."
73,Delivery men gather outside exclusive restaurant Carbone to pick up 150 orders of take-out as NYC's most exclusive restaurants shut their doors to dine-in customers,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126269/Cluster-delivery-men-gather-outside-exclusive-restaurant-Carbone.html,"There was a cluster of delivery men at Carbone, one of New York City's most exclusive restaurants, on Tuesday night after a ban on dining-in at all bars and restaurants drove hundreds online to place take-out orders.

The cluster of delivery men were not following the same social distancing approach that is being advised by the government- to stay 6ft away from people in crowds at all times for the next 15 days.Many, including the restaurant's chefs and managers, are frantically trying to soak up as much work as they can before the situation becomes even more dire.

74,North Korea claims it has ZERO cases of coronavirus and claim they have conquered the outbreak - but experts say it's 'impossible',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124191/North-Korea-claims-ZERO-cases-coronavirus-experts-say-impossible.html,"North Korea boasts that it has no cases of COVID-19, even as its neighbor to the north China has experienced more than 3,200 deaths from the global pandemic. North Korean leader Kim Jung Un claims that a 30-day quarantine, a closed border and the suspension of trade with China has kept the nation free from coronavirus. But some experts think the claim is just a cover-up. 'It's impossible for North Korea not to have a single case of coronavirus,' Jung H. Pak, a former CIA expert on North Korea, said to Fox News. Pak said the unrealistic brag from Un is likely his way of drawing attention away from North Korea's economy, human rights violations and other criminal acts. Leaders in North Korea's largest city ofPyongyang claim the country has been able to stave off coronavirus infections by fighting for 'national survival.' Officials in North Korea said they found no coronavirus infections among the more than 5,400 people who were released from quarantine. General Robert Abrams, a commander of U.S. Forces Korea, points to the low level of recent military activity in North Korea as one hint that coronavirus likely infected the country. 'It is a closed-off nation, so we can't say emphatically that they have cases, but we're fairly certain they do,' Abrams said. He added, 'What I do know is that their armed forces had been fundamentally in a lockdown for about 30 days and only recently have they started routine training again. As one example, they didn't fly an airplane for 24 days.' Some experts think North Korea's massive malnourishment problem, which can weaken the immune systems of many of its citizens, could contribute to a massive spread of coronavirus. But the country's repressive regime, ironically enough, could help curb the spread of the disease, whatever the true number is. 'There's no human rights or social freedom concerns, there's probably no concern for people starving to death,' Thomas Byrne, president of the Korea Society, who teaches international affairs at Columbia University, told Bloomberg. 'They can really enforce social distancing.' A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department has said the United States is worried about the susceptibility of the North Korean populace to widespread infections. 'The United States is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak,' said Morgan Ortagus, department spokesperson. South Korea, on the other hand, has been praised by other countries for its handling of coronavirus. The spread of the disease has steadily tampered off and is currently around 8,300 confirmed cases. It has tested over a quarter of a million of its citizens for coronavirus, representing roughly one of every 200 South Koreans. In the hopes of getting the same results, the United States and other nations are looking to adopt similar testing methods. As of Tuesday night, there were more than 197,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide with nearly 8,000 deaths."
75,"Prince George and Princess Charlotte will be home-schooled as $23,000-a-year their school moves to 'remote learning' due to increasing absences during coronavirus outbreakÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126545/Prince-George-Princess-Charlotte-home-schooled-amid-coronavirus-fears.html,"Prince George and Princess Charlotte are to be home-schooled as fears grow over coronavirus in Britain. The children, who are educated atThomas's in Battersea, will move to 'remote learning' following advice from the school. It is understood that all children at theÂ£19,000-a-year school will be sent home on Friday as a precautionary measure due to increasing absences. No one has yet tested positive for the virus at Thomas's four schools in Battersea, Clapham, Kensington and Fulham, despite the absences. Charlotte, four, started at the school in September joining her big brother George, six, who started in 2017. A spokesperson for Thomas's London Day Schools said: 'Due to the increasing number of children and staff absent from school because of the coronavirus pandemic, Thomas's London Day Schools have decided to move to remote learning from Friday 20 March. 'From this date the curriculum will be taught through online learning platforms and we have asked parents to keep their children at home and to access their lessons through this system. 'This will ensure that children have continuity of learning when they are unable to attend school. In cases where families are not in a position to keep their children at home (those who are 'front line staff' in the medical profession, for example), the school will remain physically open until the last day of term, Thursday, 26th March. 'We appreciate the support of our school community as we continue to provide the best possible solution for our pupils during these challenging times.' It comes as schools in Wales and Scotland will close by the end of this week while a decision on whether to do the same in England will be taken 'imminently'. The Welsh government announced today that all schools will close for an early Easter break by Friday at the latest. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, said her country will be doing the same due to the impact of coronavirus on staff numbers. And in a sign that the school closures may not be short term, Ms Sturgeon said she could not 'promise that they will reopen before the summer holidays'. No announcement has been made on schools in England but Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested at lunchtime at PMQs - before the Welsh and Scottish decisions were announced - that some sort of action will be taken in the very near future. Thomas's school in Battersea is housed in a Grade II listed building, the former Sir Walter St John's Grammar School which dates back to 1700. The school, which describes itself as Christian, open to children of all faiths, believes in 'praise as the greatest motivator'. Parents are told their children will be in an atmosphere which seeks positive relationships between pupils, teachers and parents. Art, ballet, drama, ICT, French, music and physical education are all taught by specialist teachers from a child's first day. Former pupils include Florence Welch, of the band Florence and the Machine. Others are model Cara Delevingne and her sisters, Poppy and Chloe. In his welcome message on the school website, headmaster Simon O'Malley says: 'Thomas's Battersea is a busy, thriving, purposeful school, educating 560 boys and girls between the ages of four and 13. 'As you would expect of any Thomas's school, the most important school rule is to 'Be Kind'. We offer a rich and broad curriculum, with art, ballet, drama, ICT, French, music and PE all taught by specialist teachers from a child's first day in school.' He added: 'We hope that our pupils will leave this school with a strong sense of social responsibility, set on a path to become net contributors to society and to flourish as conscientious and caring citizens of the world.' William and Kate are familiar figures at the school gate and have thrown themselves into school life, helping out at coffee mornings and cheering George on from the sidelines at sports day. Schools in England haven't yet officially been told to close. The PM said the government would act to 'square the circle' of making sure the spread of the virus is slowed while also ensuring there is not an adverse impact on NHS capacity. Senior figures in the government fear a blanket closure of schools would adversely affect the health service because key workers could be forced off work to look after children. There are also concerns that closing schools could lead to elderly grandparents being asked to look after grandchildren while parents continue to work. The over-70s are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus and have been urged to avoid all non-essential social contact. Education is a devolved matter in the UK which means devolved administrations have the final say on what happens to schools within their borders. A petition demanding all schools and colleges be shut down for an 'appropriate amount of time' has been surging in recent days."
76,Could school be out for the rest of the academic YEAR? Kansas cancels all classes across the state until September while California Governor Newsom says it's unlikely kids will return before summer in a bid to control the pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124421/California-Gov-Gavin-Newsom-says-schools-likely-remain-closed-rest-school-year.html,"Most California schools will likely remain closed for the rest of the school year because of the new coronavirus, Gov Gavin Newsom said Tuesday. Nearly all the state's schools have already shut down as the most populous state tries to stop the spread of the virus, and the rest will soon, he said. 'I would plan and assume it is unlikely that many of these schools, few if any, will open before the summer break,' he said in a news conference streamed online. 'I don't want to mislead you, to six-plus million kids in our system and their families, they need to make some plans at a time when a lot of plans are already being curtailed,' said Newsom, a father of four children. 'But planning with kids is some of the most challenging planning.' The state has applied for a federal waiver that means children would not have to face academic tests once they eventually return to school, said Newsom. 'We think it is totally inappropriate for kids to worry about coming back and being tested,' he said. Scroll down for video Newsom said he returned home Monday after a hectic day to find one of his two daughters, six-year-old Brooklynn, in her room, her stuffed bunny and most of her bedding on the floor, as she cried about the schools being closed and that she could not see her friends. 'I told her, ""Honey, I don't think the schools are going to open again,""' Newsom said. 'If I can tell my daughter that and not tell your daughter ... then I'm not being honest and true to the people of the state of California. Boy I hope I'm wrong, but I believe that to be the case.' Many of the shuttered schools may be used to provide meals to lower-income students, he said after meeting with hospital officials to discuss ramping up 'surge capacity' to handle a likely flood of coronavirus patients. 'We believe we will repurpose not just our operating rooms to potential ICU rooms, which was our conversation today to meet this pandemic, but we'll repurpose a lot of our school sites not only for congregate meals and food to go but also to potentially address these child care needs,' he said. Providing child care at time when residents are supposed to remain well separated to avoid spreading the disease brings its own challenges, Newsom said. Those caregivers 'will want to have personally protective gear, make sure social distancing is practiced, make sure that we not just secure the sites but make sure that they're healthy,' he said. He said some of the money approved by state lawmakers on Monday could go to help with that effort. Newsom signed into law Tuesday a bill that makes sure any public school that closes because of the virus will keep its state funding. That includes $100million for schools to use to either purchase personal protective gear for staff or pay for cleaning. He also signed legislation allowing him to spend up to $1billion 'for any item for any purpose' related to his March 4 declaration of emergency or the coronavirus outbreak. Initially, Newsom will have $500million to spend. But he can increase that spending in $50million increments, as long as he tells lawmakers about it at least three days in advance. The spending cuts off at $1billion. Also on Tuesday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly ordered all K-12 schools in the state to close for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. 'The reality of this pandemic is that it cannot be controlled statewide if school buildings return to normal operations or if they respond inconsistently within our local communities,' Kelly said Tuesday afternoon. A task force is due to present a 'continuous learning' plan on Wednesday for providing instruction by other means, such as online or by small groups, through the duration of the year, a spokeswoman said. Roughly 500,000 students are enrolled in K-12 public schools in Kansas. Other states are in talks about taking similar measures to cancel school for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year. In Florida,Gov Ron DeSantis said that all remaining testing for students K-12 has been canceled for the year. DeSantis said that parents will have a choice to keep their children in the same grade for 2020-2021 school year. He added that there will be no K-12 grades calculated for the rest of this year. On Sunday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the possibility of the city's schools closing for the remainder of the school year, but for right now they are closed until April 20. Officials in Washington state have warned that their school cancellations may last into the fall. 'Weâ€™re likely to be in this all the way to the fall and beyond,' Superintendent Chris Reykdal told KIRO. 'This could be our reality next school year because we donâ€™t have a vaccine in place likely for another 12 months.' Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday that he wouldn't be surprised if Ohio's schools remained shut for the rest of the school year. 'Odds are that this is going to go on a lot longer, and it would not surprise me at all if schools did not open again this year,' DeWine told CNN."
77,"America interrupted: Stark satellite photos reveal how coronavirus has emptied airports, parking lots and landmarks across the nation",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126563/Satellite-images-American-landmarks-airports-recreation-areas-amid-coronavirus-panic.html,"The coronavirus outbreak has dramatically disrupted American life in recent weeks as people self-isolate indoors and avoid crowds to stem the spread of the deadly strain. The pandemic's impact is captured in haunting satellite images which show usually-bustling landmarks, recreational areas and airports across the United States deserted. Private space firm Maxar Technologies shared the series of before and after images taken by its constellation of satellites on Wednesday, just as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US hit 7,323, including 115 deaths. In New York City, images taken on November 4, 2019 - roughly two months before the global outbreak began in Wuhan, China - show the Statue of Liberty, Central Park and Battery Park crowded with visitors. A second set of snaps were taken on March 11, just as the city began to see an exponential increase in cases. As of Wednesday morning, 814 cases have been reported in New York City and seven people have died as Mayor Bill de Blasio and local health officials scramble to stem the spread. The streets grew even quieter this week as all 1,900 campuses in the New York City School District were shuttered and some 27,000 restaurants and bars were forced to limit service to takeout and delivery only. On Tuesday, de Blasio announced that he is considering a shelter in place order which would prevent people from leaving their homes except for necessities. Airports that normally field thousands of passengers a day have been eerily empty in the past several weeks as travelers have cancelled flights for fear of contracting the virus en route and bringing it to a new destination. At Salt Lake City International Airport in Utah, where 51 people have tested positive for COVID-19, a photo taken on March 5 shows the planes at nearly every gate on the tarmac. A second photo from Monday shows only a few planes scattered around the tarmac as several airlines have slashed their schedules by 50 percent or more. Fewer travelers also means lower demand for rental cars, as seen in a second set of photos from the airport. On March 5 the rental car parking lot appears to be about half full, but by Monday it was brimming with unreserved vehicles. At the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Arizona, which has seen 21 cases, three sets of aerial photos tell a similar story. Photos taken on March 5 show the airport tarmac filled with planes waiting to depart and the rental car lot half-empty. Less than two weeks later on Monday, photos show a single plane preparing to take off and the parking lot full of cars. In Vermont, where 18 cases have been reported, the Killington Ski Resort has seen a dramatic decrease in visitors. A photo taken on January 30 shows the resort's parking lot filled with cars as skiiers race down the powdery slopes. But another photo taken on Monday shows the parking lot nearly empty and not a soul in site on the slopes.

On Tuesday,President Donald Trump issued a 15-day set of guidelines advising people to work from home where possible and practice social distancing. Millions have heeded the advice and are avoiding going out. Some, like in cities where the pandemic spreading the quickest, are calling for harsher action, like a two-week national shutdown to force people indoors. Startling new data indicates that as many as two million Americans may die if no further action is taken but that making people self-isolate now for 18 months could cut that figure to 200,000. ALABAMA Alabama health officials on Tuesday ordered the closure of day cares, senior centers and on-site restaurant dining in six counties to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

78,US ambassador to Mexico ignores officials' advice to avoid large gatherings amid coronavirus and takes his family out for a museum visit and to enjoy $2 churros outside Mexico City,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126103/U-S-ambassador-Mexico-ignored-coronavirus-measures-took-family-museum-eat-2-churros.html,"The United States ambassador to Mexico disregarded the growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak and advice to ignore large gatherings and shared pictures of himself and his family out for a trip to the museum and to eat churros. Christopher Landau shared a photo on his Twitter account in which he, his wife and two children were chowing down on $2 churros at a busy restaurant in the east-central city of Puebla, about 60 miles southeast of the government's embassy in Mexico City. 'Enjoying our family weekend in Puebla. Walking the center tonight, we saw a line in this churrerÃ­a and we stayed there,' he wrote late Saturday after posting a family photo, a snap of his children enjoying the night out and an empty plate. 'Excellent decision! 13 churros / $ 50. You eat too well in Puebla,' added Landau, who was appointed ambassador in August 2019. SEE VIDEO BELOW The diplomat, Landau, who was born in Madrid and went to school in Paraguay for five years, also made sure to visit theInternational Baroque Museum in Puebla. Landau gushed about the Baroque art and architecture movement that flourished in Europefrom the early 17th century until the 1740s. 'It is one of the best museums I have ever visited - and frankly I don't consider myself fond of Baroque art,' Landau wrote. 'The whole family enjoyed the interactive exhibits in a spectacular building. We didn't want to leave!' Landau was reprimanded for venturing out in public by some of his Twitter followers on Twitter, who felt he should have exerted better judgement considering that positive cases of the deadly coronavirus have doubled since last Friday, jumping from 41 to 93, as of Wednesday morning. The Mexican government has also reported 206 suspected cases. 'Ambassador, it would be good if you [followed] prevention protocols by # COVID19mx take care of yourself, take care of your family and the people around you,' one Twitter user opined. Another user took Landau to task by asking: 'Mr. Ambassador, do you not think that it is necessary, in the face of the pandemic, to reduce activities where there are crowds of people? The USA government closed flights from Europe, in Mexico there are already infections, this should be serious, what do you think?' The Mexican government has been criticized over lack of measures it has taken to prevent further outbreak of the coronavirus. Over the weekend, it allowed organizers to stage a two-day rock festival headlined by Guns N' Roses in Mexico City that drew over 60,000 music fans an outdoor venue. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador shared videos of a weekend visit to a rural town in southwestern Mexico where he was hugging and posing for pictureswith the masses.

LÃ³pez Obrador said at his morning news conference that he would attend a Saturday celebration for the birthday of revered former President Benito JuÃ¡rez. But he urged people from outside the small Oaxaca state town of Guelatao, where JuÃ¡rez was born, to stay away, saying he didn't want to open himself to criticism 'that the president is not setting an example.' Bracing for the virus to hit Mexico harder, authorities have been urging people to avoid large gatherings, to stop greeting each other with handshakes, hugs and kisses and to maintain a 'healthy distance' from each other."
79,Former Rep. Katie Hill says she has all the coronavirus symptoms but can't get tested - after her father found out he'd spent time with a person with COVID-19Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8123813/Former-Rep-Katie-Hill-says-exposed-coronavirus-tested.html,"Former Rep. Katie Hill has claimed that she was exposed to the coronavirus, is experiencing symptoms but cannot get tested. Hill, whoresigned last year after DailyMail.com revealed that she had been in a relationship with a campaign aide, shared the news in a series of tweets on Monday. 'I was exposed to COVID-19,' Hill wrote. 'I have had a dry cough, shortness of breath, & a fever since Saturday. Hill said her father found out on Saturday that he'd 'spent a lot of time with a person who tested positive for COVID-19'. 'I was exposed to my dad, but I could have been way before that too... we will never know,' Hill tweeted, adding that she then followed the guidelines, 'called the hotline' and answered a series of questions. 'Was told I needed to talk to a doc based on my symptoms, got a phone appt with my primary physician and stayed home in the meantime,' she shared. Hill said her doctor then told her that 'despite my symptoms, since I was not in DIRECT contact with the confirmed case, I wonâ€™t get tested UNLESS Iâ€™M HOSPITALIZED'. 'Because my dad ALSO still hasnâ€™t been tested and thus is not confirmed,' she tweeted. In several other tweets, Hill said she's lucky because she's young.'I probably wonâ€™t get too sick, & I can hang out in my apartment for two weeks. But my doctor told me yes, you almost certainly have it but nothing to do except quarantine myself & if it gets worse, like I literally CANNOT BREATHE, go to the hospital.' She alsoexpressed her thoughts about the way the pandemic is being handled. '1) weâ€™re not testing enough ppl to know how big this thing is; 2) if you think you're in the clear, you're not; 3) our healthcare system is about to be dangerously overloaded & only we can save it so#StayTheF**kHome. 'Despite what the administration is saying, tests are still in such short supply that public health departments are directing doctors to only test in very specific incidences. 'ERâ€™s around the country are warning about how they are already over capacity bc of the ""worried well"". They donâ€™t have tests (or nearly enough) in the ERs. If you go, youâ€™ll expose yourself, transmit disease, and take up room from others. Unless you absolutely have to,' she tweeted. Hill continued: 'This is just me. One person. Donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ve been exposed, if I actually have it, how many people Iâ€™ve in turn exposed. Never will. Will never be in the official numbers unless it gets bad enough so hopefully not. 'Now imagine how many people out there are like me and canâ€™t get tested, or who have the virus and are carrying it and infecting others and have no idea. Our numbers are way off, and likely will be for the foreseeable future 'So, donâ€™t expect a test, shut yourself in, PLEASE donâ€™t go to the hospital unless you ABSOLUTELY have to, and letâ€™s ride this thing out together.' There are more than 6,400 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States with more than 100 deaths.Globally, there are more than 197,000 confirmed cases and nearly 8,000 deaths. Health officials have been warning the government that they're not fully equipped to handle a massive coronavirusoutbreak after experts estimated the US could see as many as 1 million cases of COVID-19. Hospitals are setting up triage tents, calling doctors out of retirement, guarding their supplies of face masks and making plans to cancel elective surgery as they brace for an expected onslaught of coronavirus patients. Depending on how bad the crisis gets, the sick could find themselves waiting on stretchers in emergency room hallways for hospital beds to open up, or be required to share rooms with other infected patients. Some doctors fear hospitals could become so overwhelmed that they could be forced to ration medical care. 'This is going to be a fairly tremendous strain on our health system,' warned Dr. William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Several states have taken strident measures in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. States like New York, parts of California, Illinois, Ohio and others have closed bars and restaurants and limited customers to takeout or delivery options. Schools have closed, including the nation's largest public school system in New York City."
80,Couple caught having sex in a car in Milan are arrested for breaching coronavirus lockdown,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126655/Couple-caught-having-sex-car-Milan-arrested-breaching-coronavirus-lockdown.html,"A couple caught having sex in a car were arrested for breaching coronavirus quarantine rules in Italy. The 23-year-old Egyptian man and 40-year-old Tunisian woman were caught in the act by a police officer on the outskirts of Milan on Monday. Quite apart from decency laws, the pair chose a particularly bad time for their roadside fling, with authorities on alert for breaches of the virus lockdown. The pair were accused of ignoring a quarantine rule which bans two people from being in the front or back of a vehicle together, according to news agency ANSA. It is not clear whether the couple will face further action, but authorities have been keeping a wary eye on all road vehicles in order to enforce a ban on travel. Italians are only allowed outside to buy food, give or receive medical care, or travel to work if absolutely necessary. Despite the ample opportunities for indoor entertainment, the couple were caught in the act on a road in Mecenate near Milan which has been heavily hit by the outbreak. Elsewhere, a family who were relaxing on a lawn were ordered to move by police in San Donato Milanese near Milan today. The region of Lombardy which includes Milan has had the largest number of cases in Italy and hospitals in the northern province are struggling to cope. Doctors have described how medical centres have become 'overwhelmed' with medics forced to make life-or-death decisions about intensive care. There are fears that the health system in the poorer south of Italy would be totally unable to cope if the outbreak occurred on the same scale there. Italy is now requiringanyone entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days unless they are only stopping over for 72 hours or can prove that they must go to work. The latest figures yesterday showed3,526 new cases taking the total to31,506. The number of daily cases has shown signs of steadying in recent days. The Italian death toll rose by 345 to 2,503."
81,103-year-old Iranian woman 'makes full recovery' from coronavirus after being in hospital for a weekÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125603/103-year-old-Iranian-woman-makes-recovery-coronavirus.html,"A 103-year-old woman in Iran has recovered after being infected with the new coronavirus, state media reported yesterday, despite overwhelming evidence the elderly are most at risk from the disease. The unnamed woman had been hospitalised in the central city of Semnan for about a week, IRNA news agency said. But she was 'discharged after making a complete recovery', Semnan University of Medical Sciences head Navid Danayi was quoted as saying by IRNA late Tuesday. The woman was the second elderly patient in Iran to have survived the disease. The other was a 91-year-old man from Kerman, in the southeast of Iran, the news agency said. After being sick for three days, he recovered on Monday despite having pre-existing medical conditions including high blood pressure and asthma, it added. The report did not say how the pair were treated. Since Iran announced its first deaths on 19 February, the novel coronavirus has spread to all of the country's 31 provinces and killed nearly 1,000 people. The elderly are the most vulnerable to the disease, which first emerged in China late last year. It comes asIran said its novel coronavirus death toll surpassed 1,000 on Wednesday as President Hassan Rouhani defended the response of his administration, which has yet to impose a lockdown. The COVID-19 outbreak in sanctions-hit Iran is one of the deadliest for any country outside China, where the disease originated. Rouhani's government reported another 147 deaths -- a record high for a single day in the month since it announced the emergence of the disease. The virus has now killed 1,135 people in Iran out of 17,361 cases of infection based on official figures. Speaking next to ministers wearing face masks Rouhani said: 'Some ask why the government isn't intervening, but I think we have intervened significantly. 'Great things have been done (including) measures no other country has taken,' he said in televised remarks after a weekly meeting of his cabinet.' He added:'We will get past these hard days.' Since it announced its first two deaths in the holy Shiite city of Qom on February 19, Iran has taken a series of steps to contain the virus. It has closed schools and universities until early April and also four key Shiite pilgrimage sites, including the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom. Iran has also discouraged travel, cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers and temporarily closed parliament. The World Health Organization this month estimated the novel coronavirus kills 3.4 per cent of all those infected. But for people aged over 80 the fatality rate was 21.9 per cent, according to a report the WHO carried out with the Chinese authorities. "
82,Fourth NYPD cop tests positive for coronavirus as 17 fellow officers at his Manhattan station go into isolation and another 14 call out sick,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125959/NYPD-1st-Precinct-officer-tests-positive-coronavirus-31-station-call-sick.html,"An NYPD officer in New York City's Lower Manhattan has tested positive for coronavirus, while 31 others at the precinct have called out sick. He is the fourth NYPD officer to test positive for the virus since the pandemic began. The latest case was from the city's 1st Precinct. Another 31 officers that have called out sick - including the precinct's commanding officer and executive officer. Of those, 17 have complained of having flu-like symptoms and are self-quaranting. Officials have said that the officers are being 'monitored' but have not yet been tested for the virus. All told, 17 per cent of the 1st Precinct's staff is currently out sick - a number officials called 'a very large percent of the precinct.' The precinct, however, remains open at this time as officials are investigating to see if the officer who tested positive contracted the virus while on duty, CBS 2 reported. To combat any staffing shortages in the future, the precinct said that it does have a contingency plan. Sources told CBS 2 that the department would institute mandatory 12-hour shifts - similar to tactics used after 9/11. Among the tactics police officers are being asked to use to stay safe are toavoid having unnecessary staffing at crime scenes and, in the event of non-emergency calls, asking people to exit their homes and talk on the street instead of entering homes, NY1 reported. The 1st Precinct officer, who has not been named, is now the fourth NYPD officer to have been publicly confirmed as having tested positive for coronavirus. The other who have the virus are NYPD Transit Bureau Chief Edward Delatorre, Deputy Commissioner for Employee Relations Robert Ganley and a Queens School Safety Agent. The NYPD has 36,000 officers and almost 20,000 civilian employees. Despite NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio warning Tuesday that city denizens should be prepared to shelter-in-place within the coming days, New York State governor Andrew Cuomo said that the city will not be going into lockdown. During a press conference Wednesday, Cuomo said that 'The fear, the panic is a bigger problem than the virus.' Cuomo also said 'I don't believe any policy works unless the geographic footprint is large enough. It can't just be New York City. 'Also shelter in place, you close down your health care system, you close down your food system, you close down your transportation system . And you close down businesses. That doesn't make sense to me because people need to eat travel etc.' A statement posted on theNew York State's website noted that'Any blanket quarantine or shelter in place policy would require State action and as the Governor has said, there is no consideration of that for any locality at this time.' Despite Cuomo's latest statement, de Blasio said that he intends to continuing discussing the idea of locking down the city with the governor. As of Wednesday morning, 2,382 people had tested positive in New York State, up more than 800 since Tuesday. In New York City cases went up from 814 on Tuesday to 1,339 people testing positive by Wednesday."
83,Fox News host Tucker Carlson backs Donald Trump for calling coronavirus 'the Chinese virus' and says it shows the president 'at his best'Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125943/Fox-News-host-Tucker-Carlson-praises-Donald-Trump-calling-coronavirus-Chinese-virus.html,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson praised Donald Trump for repeatedly referring to COVID-19 as 'the Chinese virus'. The president has used the term multiple times on Twitter, prompting critics - including Chinese officials - to accuse him of promoting racist rhetoric against Asians. Carlson addressed the backlash on his show Tucker Carlson Tonight on Tuesday and expressed his support for Trump. 'Today, NBC News sent a tweet suggesting the president's use of the phrase 'Chinese virus' was, quote, both inaccurate and harmful, in tying racist associations between the virus and those from China,' the host said. 'Another statement written by morons in our news media. How is it inaccurate to call a virus from China ""Chinese?""' Scroll down for video 'The president, to his credit, does not seem intimidated,' Carlson added before cutting to a clip of Trump dismissing criticisms at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. In the clip a reporter is heard asking Trump whether he will continue to use the phrase despite having been told its offensive. 'Well, China was putting out information which was false, that our military gave this to them, which was false,' he responded, referencing his administration's previous accusations that China was spreading conspiracy theories about the virus being created by the US military. 'Rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It came from China.' 'Good for him,' Carlson stated at the clip's conclusion. 'That was Trump at his very best.' 'Why would our media take the side of China in a crisis like this?' he asked. A graphic with the words 'Chinese Coronavirus in America' was shown on the screen as he spoke. Federal officials including the head of the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have sought to reduce racist stigma surrounding COVID-19 by warning against referring to the strain in a way that links it with China, where the outbreak began in December in the city of Wuhan. World Health Organization guidelines caution leaders to avoid naming a disease after a location because doing so can stigmatize an area or ethnic group. But Trump - who has faced fierce criticism over his handling of the pandemic in the US and also has a long history of alleged racism and xenophobia - has sought to cast the novel coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.  While COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries. As of Wednesday, 7,323 people in the US have tested positive for COVID-19 across all 50 states and 115 have died. Trump drew the ire of Chinese officials on Monday when he referred to COVID-19 as the 'Chinese virus' in a tweet. 'The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!' he wrote. Beijing responded early on Tuesday by demanding that 'the US side correct the mistake immediately and halt its groundless accusations'. Trump then doubled down, tweeting Tuesday morning about New York's governor Andrew Cuomo - who has demanded the military are activated to build hospitals - that: 'Cuomo wants 'all states to be treated the same.' 'But all states aren't the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all.' Hours later an Asian-American reporter for CBS News added fuel to the controversy when she accused a White House official of calling coronavirus the 'Kung Flu' right to her face. Weijia Jiang, who was born in Chinaand raised in West Virginia, shared the unsettling encounter on Twitter, writing:'This morning a White House official referred to#Coronavirusas the ""Kung-Flu"" to my face. 'Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back.' Dozens of social media users expressed outrage over the comment, charging that Trump is responsible for racist rhetoric surrounding coronavirus. Several other pro-Trump officials have referred to the deadly strain as the 'Wuhan virus', including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sen Tom Cotton (R - Oklahoma) and Congressman Paul Gosar (R - Arizona). Pompeo accused China of spreading conspiracy theories that the virus was the creation of the US military. Contrasting conspiracy theories charging that the virus was created by China as a tool for biological warfare have been aired in pro-Trump circles in the US. Geng Shuang, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Tuesday accused 'certain American politicians' of promoting stigmatization by connecting the novel coronavirus with China. He did not name Trump specifically, but was believed to be responding to the president's tweet hours earlier, Chinese state news agency Xinhuareported. 'We express strong indignation and resolute opposition to this,' Geng said at a daily news briefing. He stressed that the coronavirus outbreak had occurred in multiple places around the world and the urgent task was for the international community to join forces to curb the pandemic. 'The United States should mind its own business first, and then make constructive contributions to the international counter-epidemic collaboration and the maintenance of the global public health safety,' Geng said. China later retaliated by announcing that Beijing would expel American journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Trump responded to the snub by tripling down on the offending term in a string of tweets. 'For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!' the first tweet read. About an hour later he added: 'I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!' In a third tweet he stated: 'I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ""borders"" from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!'"
84,"Nevada orders ALL casinos to close shutting downÂ The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Luxor and New York-New York in effort to slow spread of coronavirusÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125261/Nevada-orders-casinos-nonessential-businesses-close.html,"Gambling will grind to a halt by Wednesday in casino-mecca Las Vegas after Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak shut down all nonessential businesses. 'This is only common sense. This is effecting the lives of our citizens. People are dying. Every day that is delayed here, I'm losing a dozen people on the back end that are going to die as a result of this,' Sisolak said announcing the 30 days closures at a press conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday evening. Slot machines were shut down at midnight Tuesday, local time. The casinos, which employ tens of thousands of workers, will be closedat noon Wednesday. Sisolak added: 'In a time where people are getting sick from simply being near others, this is not the time for gyms to remain open. This is not the time for casinos to remain open.' This is not a time for community recreation centers, clubhouses, movie theaters and malls to remain open.' Nevada has reported more than 50 cases of the virus so far, including one death. Scroll down for complete list of shutdowns Essential services, such as fire, police, transit, and health care services would remain open. The last time casinos closed in Las Vegas was for John F. Kennedy's funeral on Nov. 25, 1963. Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said in an email to The Associated Press Tuesday night that to his knowledge, it was the first time all Nevada casinos have been ordered closed statewide. He previously said this week's intentional casino closures may be only the fourth since gambling was legalized in Las Vegas in 1931. 'The state occasionally revoked a license and ordered one closed, but nothing like this,' he wrote. Sisolak also exempted businesses that provide food, shelter, or social services for disadvantaged populations from closing. He added: 'What are you willing to do to save your life and the life of the ones you love? Please take this seriously. Please stay home for Nevada.' In response, companies including casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp said they would temporarily shut down their establishments. 'It has become clear that we must take this extreme action to help contain the virus and protect the safety and well-being of our team members and guests,' said Caesars Entertainment Chief Executive Officer Tony Rodio. Derek Stevens, owner of the D Las Vegas and Golden Gate, said: 'Although this is a devastating time for our country and our community, I'm confident the Las Vegas resiliency will allow us to rise again, stronger than ever.' The MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts had already said they would be closing temporarily. Wynn Resorts has said it will pay employees for 30 days. The Hoover Dam, near the Arizona border and another Nevada tourist attraction, is temporarily closing to visitors 'because of the nature of the structure and an inability to implement social distancing standards recommended by the' CDC, according to a statement. The highly contagious respiratory illness is on the rise in the United States, with more than 6,400 people infected and at least 109 dead. Following the decision to shut all casinos on the strip the American Gaming Association said: 'Nevada is the epicenter of the resilient American gaming industry. 'The federal government must act swiftly to bring relief to our friends, neighbors, and colleagues in Nevada and all across America whose livelihoods have been severely impacted by these hard but necessary actions.' The shutdown of the multi-billion-dollar industry is a hammer blow for the city's tourism and entertainment sectors as hotel occupancy rates have already begun to nosedive. The leisure and hospitality industry directly employs one of every four workers in the state and has an economic output of about $68 billion in Nevada, according to the Nevada Resort Association. According to Wynn Resorts' official figures on its website, the company's operating revenues over three months up to last September were $1.65 billion. MGM Grand posted net revenues of $3.2 billion over three months up to the end of 2019, the firm's accounts state. Several employees at MGM Resorts International hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, including at least one at Luxor, tested positive in a presumptive test for COVID-19 over the weekend. On Friday it emerged two employees, one at the Luxor and another at the Wet Republic pool, tested positive. In a statement, MGM said they will not be taking any reservations prior to May 1.

85,'We calculated the risk and decided to be together': Idris Elba addresses backlash over his decision to have wife Sabrina by his side when he revealed he has tested positive for coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8124935/Idris-Elba-addresses-backlash-decision-wife-Sabrina-side.html,"Idris Elba has spoken out against critics who suggested his wife Sabrina Dhowre Elba should not have been by his side when he announced he has tested positive for coronavirus. The Luther star, 47, posted a video on Monday night confirming he has tested positive, but appeared with his model wife in the video, who has not been diagnosed with the virus. UK Government guidelines advise those who have tested positive should ideally self quarantine in their home, away from other family members who have not been diagnosed. Idris took part in a Twitter Live video on Tuesday evening to give his fans an update, 24 hours on from his diagnosis. The actor reassured fans he is feeling well, explaining: 'Yesterday was good and bad. Bad because I tested positive, but it was also good because it opened up a lot of conversation around it.' 'I think it made it a lot more real for some people. Definitely made it more real for me and my family.' 'There was so many positive responses to, you know, me talking about it. Some negative too. But there were some definite positive ones. I certainly feltâ€¦my wife and I felt like it was the right thing to do, to share it with you guys,' he added. 'He went on to address the 'negative' comments he had received about choosing to be with Sabrina, explaining the couple, who married in 2019, had 'calculated the risk.' He also explained Sabrina has now been tested. 'Sabrina's good too. Sabrina today finally managed to get a test, and we're thankful for that. Generally, Sabrina's fine. Nervous of course. Worried. Just for clarification, Sabrina wanted to be by my side.' 'As much as we talked about her not coming to where I am, she did and wanted to and I love her even more for it and I would do the same for her.' 'As much as I wanted her to keep safe, we presumed if I had it, the likelihood she would have it too, we calculated that risk,' he went on. 'When something like this is going on in the world, love is all you can get, who am I to turn down my wife's support?' The British actor urged his followers to spread love and advised families to follow guidelines but do what works best for them. Elsewhere in Tuesday night's video Idris appeared to confirm he had contracted the virus fromCanadian Prime Minister's wife Justin Trudeau Sophie, 44, after the two met shortly before they both tested positive for COVID-19. The actor revealed that he was exposed to the deadly disease on 4 March, the same day he posed with Sophie at the We Day UK charity event, in Wembley. Idris said: 'It's hard to say when I got the disease or when I contracted COVID-19, it's hard to say when. I will say that I know I've been exposed to it from March 4. 'That's when the person that came up positive, that was the time I got in contact with that person. 'So essentially, I could have been positive from March 4, but it's hard to say when I contracted someone with corona, you can contract it at anytime but my known exposure was March 4.' Idris met Trudeau's wife Sophie, who has also been tested positive for COVID-19, on 4 March at a We Day UK charity event, in Wembley. Posing for photos together at the event, the pair were in close proximity to each other, as well as other celebrities such as Lewis Hamilton, and attendees. The actor also added in the video: 'On Friday, last week, I was told that someone I had been in contact with had tested positive. 'I am on location about to start filming. The news breaks that this person, who is also in the public eye, has tested positive.' Idris then addressed backlash as to why he was tested for COVID-19 after he had 'no symptoms' and 'felt ok'. Idris said he was on location and about to start filming, he added: 'It was definitely something I had to do as I was about to start filming and be around a lot of people. 'My job made me test immediately, I had to test anyway, as it meant I was putting a lot of people at risk if I had been exposed. We were lucky to get a test very quickly because of the shortages of the test. 'It was the best thing to do, I was going to be around a lot of people starting this film.' Although the star admitted that he is worried as he suffers from asthma, he added: 'I have asthma, so I sort of fit into the high category of most at risk. 'I have a respiratory issue and I have had asthma all my life. Catching corona was definitely not on my bucket list at all but even my asthma is OK. 'Of course I'm worried. I'm worried about having the virus, I'm worried about having asthma and how that could make things really complicated for me really quickly.' He reassured his followers that at present he is feeling fine, explaining: 'Right now though, I am feeling okay. Woke up this morning, didn't have any symptoms. My voice is a little tiredâ€¦checking my fever twice a day. Feel good, feel okay. Been doing a lot of reading about it. You know, asymptomatic is what comes up,' Idris explained about his status. Idris revealed he was inspired to share his coronavirus story after fellow actor Tom Hanks also shared that he tested positive for COVID-19."
86,NHL has its first coronavirus case as an unidentified Ottawa Senators player becomes the latest sports star to test positive amid the league's indefinite suspension,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124673/Senators-reveal-positive-COVID-19-test-NHL.html,"The Ottawa Senators have announced that an unnamed player tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the first NHL player to be diagnosed with coronavirus. The player is in isolation with 'mild symptoms,' and the Senators asked the rest of the team to remain isolated while their medical staff monitors the health of the players. The Senators said the organization is working to notify anyone known to have had close contact with the player and is working with team doctors and public health officials. The NHL suspended play with 189 regular season games left to play. It remains unclear when the league will resume the 2019-2020 campaign. 'As a result of this positive case, all members of the Ottawa Senators are requested to remain isolated, to monitor their health and seek advice from our team medical staff,' the team said in a statement Tuesday. Ottawa played at the San Jose Sharks on March 7 before remaining in California to play the Anaheim Ducks on March 10 and Los Angeles Kings on March 11 before the season was suspended indefinitely last week. 'The health of our players, fans, and community remains our highest priority,' the team said. 'We will continue to do everything we can to help ensure our players, staff, fans and the greater community remain safe and healthy during this time of uncertainty due to the spread of the coronavirus.' On Tuesday, injured NBA All-Star Kevin Durant and three of his Brooklyn Nets teammates were revealed to have tested positive forcoronavirus, joining Utah Jazz stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert as well as Detroit's Christian Wood as the league's only known cases. The club announced the diagnoses on Tuesday afternoon without mentioning any names. Shortly thereafter Durant told Shams Charania of The Athletic that he was among the unidentified players who contracted the virus. 'Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine,' Durant told The Athletic. 'We're going to get through this.' The Nets tested players following a return from flight San Francisco, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. The team paid a private firm to conduct the tests, which came back positive on Tuesday. One player is dealing with aches while others have experienced a few symptoms as well. The team is currently reaching out to those who may have been exposed to the four infected players. 'The organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting,' read a team statement on Tuesday."
87,Steve Kerr says USA Basketball STILL planning to defend gold medal at Tokyo Olympics but admits 'everything is just up in the air' amid pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8124493/Kerr-says-USA-Basketball-planning-Tokyo-2020.html,"According to assistant coach Steve Kerr, the USA Basketball coaching staff for the Tokyo Olympics is still preparing as if there will be a gold medal to defend this summer, even in highly uncertain times caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. Kerr, the head coach of the NBA's Golden State Warriors, said on a conference call that he spoke with Team USA head coach Gregg Popovich, who did not relay any news about a possible postponement or cancellation. Kerr is slated to be on a staff that also includes Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce and Villanova coach Jay Wright, who served under Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs head coach, at the Basketball World Cup in China last summer. Team USA failed to medal, finishing seventh with a pair of losses. 'Everything's just up in the air,' Kerr said. 'There's no sense of whether things are going to be delayed or anything. We're all kind of wondering what's going to happen and so is the rest of the world.' The Olympics are scheduled to start July 24. The International Olympic Committee said Tuesday that the uncertainty of things right now is 'an unprecedented situation for the whole world.' 'The IOC remains fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, and with more than four months to go before the Games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage,' the IOC said, adding that any other 'speculation at this moment would be counter-productive.' USA Basketball revealed last month a list of 44 players - most of the league's biggest American stars among them and 15 of the 16 U.S.-born NBA All-Stars from this season - who are under consideration for the Olympic team. The original plan was to pick a 12-player roster by early June, and for that team to gather in Las Vegas in early July to begin training camp. Officially, no part of that plan has changed yet. Like the NBA and the rest of the sports world, USA Basketball is very much in wait-and-see mode. 'We're just going to plan as if it's going to happen and we're going to try to put together a roster,' Kerr said. 'That's all we can do.' On Tuesday, injured NBA All-Star Kevin Durant and three of his Brooklyn Nets teammates were revealed to have tested positive forcoronavirus, joining Utah Jazz stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert as well as Detroit's Christian Wood as the league's only known cases.

And two days later, Jon Voight took to his Twitter as he led a prayer to God to rid the world of the coronavirus, which is now a global pandemic. The Oscar-winning actor and spirited supporter of Donald Trump, 81, told fellow Americans that 'we will rid this virus' as he asked God to 'wipe away the curse that has taken us down with fear.' Jon, who is the father of Angelina Jolie, also specifically said 'God bless this nation and the entire creation,' as well as specifically asking God to protect 'our president and his family.' He said in the Twitter video: 'This nation is under God with liberty. Joshua has lifted his arc and will show his kingdom that this virus will not wipe out his men. He will battle to the end and he will show Jesus the prayer.' Jon continued: 'Oh Mighty. Oh Lord bring us to our feet to love you more. Oh Lord, oh our Savior, teach us more but lift this veil over our heads. Wipe away the curse that has taken us down with fear. Oh Lord give us peace on our holy land, give us peace for our children and elders.' Adding: 'Oh Lord give us light to shine on our souls so we may strong to fight. Oh Lord, we are all one with you.' Jon concluded with: 'My fellow Americans, we will rid this virus. We will be strong because we are the greatest gift to mankind. We are all God's children. God bless this nation and the entirecreation and may God protect our president and his family.Love to you.' He tweeted out the clip with the caption: This Nation Is Under God.' On Sunday, Jon was snapped as he stocked up on paper towels at a local grocery store in Sherman Oaks amid the coronavirus pandemic that has shut down schools, businesses and more across the world. The global coronavirus pandemic has reached over 200,00 confirmed cases and over 8,222 deaths as of Wednesday afternoon. Domestically, there has been 7,323 confirmed cases in the US with 115 deaths, as of Wednesday afternoon. The risk of serious illness as a result of COVID-19 is particularly high for those in Jon's age group, as senior citizens and those with compromised immune systems are most susceptible to respiratory failure, as stated by the Centers for Disease Control. Jon is father to Angelina, 44, and also James Haven, 46; their mother was actress Marcheline Bertrand, to whom Jon was married from 1971 until 1980. Marcheline passed away in 2007 from ovarian and breast cancer at the age of 56."
89,"Italy's coronavirus crisis was accelerated because young Italians spend more time with elderly relatives and took illness home from the cities to the countryside, Oxford scientists say",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125457/Italys-coronavirus-crisis-worsened-multi-generational-homes.html,"Italy's coronavirusoutbreak may be so devastating because it has such an old population and the elderly come into frequent contact with the young. A study by the University of Oxford has suggested that multiple generations living under the same roofs 'accelerated' the spread of the virus in rural Italy. More than 31,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus in the crisis-hit country and at least 2,503 people have died â€“ a death rate of almost one in 12. The country has the world's second oldestpopulation after Japan â€“ 22 per cent of people are over 65 â€“ and people in that group are known to be more likely to die if infected. But it could be the movements of young people which triggered the disaster. It's common for young adults in rural areas to live with their parents and grandparents but to commute into cities, such as Milan, to work and socialise. They may have been picking up the virus while travelling and brought it home without realising they were ill, the Oxford researchers said. Another study published this week suggested that 86 per cent of patients may have no idea they're ill in the early stages of a country's epidemic, raising the risk of this deadly spread going unnoticed. And the UK also has an ageing population â€“ there are 11.9million people over the age of 65 and people are living, on average, three years longer than they did in 2003 â€“ so the way the virus has spread in Italy could be a lesson for the British Government. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people not to visit sick or elderly relatives as one of his dramatic measures announced this week to protect the UK. Italy's devastating outbreak has been centred around Milan and the more rural areas surrounding it in the Lombardy and Veneto provinces. The whole country is in lockdown and all citizens have been banned from travelling and urged from going outside â€“ all tourists have been sent home. In their study, published in the journal Demographic Science, the researchers wrote: 'Even relatively few connections between communities can lead to a stark reduction in average network distances; the so-called small world phenomenon. 'Such community â€œconnectingâ€ individuals might be those young people around Milan that work in the city but reside in the most hard-hit villages in the surrounding with their parents and grandparents. 'Thus, intergenerational co-residence may have accelerated the outbreak by creating intercommunity connections that increase the proximity of elderly to the initial cases, an area for further study.' THE SICK MUST STAY AT HOME Anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms is urged to stay at home and limit social contact, including with their doctor. NO TRAVEL ACROSS ITALY Travel is only allowed for 'urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons'. Grocery shopping is considered a 'necessity' and still allowed. To avoid work-related travel, public and private companies have been urged to put their staff on leave. Flights, trains and public transport will continue but Prime Minister GiuseppeConte says he wants as many people as possible to stay at home. People who do want to travel will need to fill in a document explaining their reasons for doing so and carry it with them. NO PUBLIC GATHERINGS 'All forms of gatherings in public places or sites open to the public' are banned, the decree says. Cinemas, museums, theatres, pubs, dance schools, betting shops and discos are all closed. Weddings and funerals are banned. Schools and universities will remain shut until April 3. Bars and restaurants were only allowed to open between 8am and 6pm, the decree said, and only if a distance of at least 3ft could be kept between customers. Sporting events of all levels and disciplines were cancelled - stopping play in the Serie A football league.Fixtures in international competitions can go ahead but will be played behind closed doors. Gyms, sports centres, swimming pools, spas and leisure centres must close. SHOPS MUST KEEP 3FT DISTANCE Shops can remain open but only if they can guarantee the 3ft safety distance for customers. Big and mid-sized shopping centres have to close at the weekend. Food stores are allowed to remain open at all hours. NO LEAVE FOR HEALTH WORKERS Leave for health workers is cancelled. People accompanying their friends or relatives to emergency units are not allowed to stay with them in the waiting rooms without express permission. The danger of the lifestyle described in the study is that the city-goers interact with a lot of people, visit busy places and work or travel in more cramped conditions. They risk picking up the virus and spreading it without realising, either because they get such a mild illness, or because it is transmitted before they get sick. And through this route, the virus could make its way out of a city like Milan â€“ where travellers will have brought it in â€“ into smaller villages in the countryside. Italy has the biggest population of elderly people in Europe, and the second oldest in the world, with almost a quarter of people (22 per cent) aged 65 or older. And the median age â€“ the middle of the age range â€“ is 46.5 years old, according to the CIA â€“ the fifth highest in the world. For comparison, the UK's median age ranks 50th is 40.6 (18 per cent aged over 65) and the US's is 38.5 (17 per cent over 65). The older someone is, the more deadly catching the coronavirus can be. Age is known to be one of the biggest risk factors because the immune system and lungs are naturally weaker so the body is less able to fend off pneumonia, which the virus causes in severe cases. Older people are also more likely to have the types of long-term illnesses which raise the risk of coronavirus becoming fatal, such as diabetes or heart disease. Research has found that people aged 80 or over have a 14.8 per cent risk (one in seven) of dying if they develop COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. But one of the authors of the Oxford study, Dr Jennifer Dowd, said simply trying to shut off old people from the rest of the society would not be enough. The Government in the UK had spoken of trying to protect the elderly with a 'cocoon' strategy by keeping them inside care homes and their own homes. Officials came under fire last week for appearing to suggest they were hoping the virus would spread among healthy, young people, to build up a herd immunity which could protect the vulnerable by making the virus unable to spread through the population. Now, however, over-70s in Britain are being urged to stay home and avoid contact with other people to reduce their risk of getting infected. But Dr Dowd said: 'One of the points that we were trying to make is that it's not necessarily just about isolating the older population,' Wired reported. 'We are identifying that they're the most vulnerableâ€”but the general social distancing that's being encouraged to flatten the curve.' 'Flattening the curve' is a phrase that refers to trying to prolong and outbreak and spread the cases out over a longer period to reduce the pressure on hospitals. 'I think our point was that's actuallyimportant when you have a higher fraction of your population that is vulnerable,' Dr Dowd added."

The Islamic republic is one of the worst-hit countries with the virus outside of China after announcing its first death on February 19. 'Now everyone knows about this disease, and what is very strange is that some don't take it seriously,' Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi said in a televised news conference. 'If people help, we can control it, and if not, then expect it to last more than two months.' Raisi said 1,192 new infections were confirmed in the past 24 hours, raising the total to 17,161. Tehran province had the highest number of new cases with 213. Isfahan in central Iran was second with 162, followed by East Azerbaijan in the northwest with 84. The deputy minister complained that in Tehran 'bazaars are busy' and that people travel in their cars despite warnings not to do so. 'Just be patient for these two weeks so that, God willing, we can overcome this virus,' Raisi said. The country's New Year holidays start on March 20 this year and will last until early April, with many Iranians traditionally travelling to popular spots such as northern provinces. Iran is yet to impose any lockdowns but officials have repeatedly called on the public to stay home for the holidays. The regime on Monday closed four key Shiite pilgrimage sites. Theholy shrines of Imam Reza in Mashhad, Fatima Masumeh in Qom and Shah Abdol-Azim in Tehran were shut until further notice. The country yesterdayissued its most dire warning about coronavirus, suggesting 'millions' could die in the Islamic Republic if the public keeps ignoring health guidance. A state television journalist who is also a medical doctor gave the warning after Shiite faithful pushed their way into the courtyards of two major shrines that had just been closed over fears of the virus. The country said yesterday it has temporarily freed around 85,000 prisoners including political detainees in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus. The regime has been widely criticised for its handling of the outbreak, including for its reluctance to shut down holy pilgrimage sites. Most cases across the Middle East have been linked to Iran, with many countries shutting down travel."
91,Brooklyn residents yell at people in the street to go home because 'You can get people sick just by being out'Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126255/Brooklynites-spreads-coronavirus-awareness-chanting-flatten-curve-home-balcony.html,"Residents of the upmarket Brooklyn Park Slope neighborhood have taken to using their balconies as a way to spread the coronavirus 'flatten the curve' and stay at home message. One man, who has not been identified, was caught on video as he chastised the people milling about on the sidewalks below. 'Flatten the curve, go home!' the man could be heard shouting and clapping to emphasize his point. Once he started up, other people off-screen, but near the person who recorded the video, could be heard joining in and also shouting 'go home.' The man is at least the second person in the borough to have used his balcony as a pedestal to share information about the need to prevent the spread of coronavirus. In another video, another unidentified man can be seen standing on a different balcony, explaining why passersby should be self-quarantining. 'We know people who do not show symptoms can still spread the disease,' the mansaid. So even if you feel perfectly healthy and not showing symptoms, you could be spreading the disease right now.' He also pointed out the particular danger the virus presents for the elderly or immuno-compromised. 'You can get people sick just by being out,' he added. Government officials are starting to use the term 'flattening the curve,' relating to decreasing or slowing down the spread of the virus. By lowering therate of infection, the epidemic is then spread out over time - as opposed to peaking in a sharp spike - which creates less demand on the healthcare system, allowing for more patient care as cases are spread out across the outbreak, according to Our World in Data. Despite NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio warning Tuesday that city denizens should be prepared to shelter-in-place within the coming days, New York State governor Andrew Cuomo said that the city will not be going into lockdown. During a press conference Wednesday, Cuomo said that 'The fear, the panic is a bigger problem than the virus.' Cuomo also said 'I don't believe any policy works unless the geographic footprint is large enough. It can't just be New York City. 'Also shelter in place, you close down your health care system, you close down your food system, you close down your transportation system . And you close down businesses. That doesn't make sense to me because people need to eat travel etc.' A statement posted on theNew York State's website noted that'Any blanket quarantine or shelter in place policy would require State action and as the Governor has said, there is no consideration of that for any locality at this time.' Despite Cuomo's latest statement, de Blasio said that he intends to continuing discussing the idea of locking down the city with the governor. As of Wednesday morning, 2,382 people had tested positive in New York State, up more than 800 since Tuesday. In New York City cases went up from 814 on Tuesday to 1,339 people testing positive by Wednesday."

It was already a historic birthday forMillie Erickson, a great-grandmother who resides inSterling Village nursing home, but with her turning the century in the midst of a national emergency caused by the coronavirus it looked like it may be difficult to celebrate. With the elderly and those with underlying conditions more at risk of serious illness from the coronavirus, many nursing homes, including Millie's, have placed a ban on visitors meaning that her family were restricted from bringing her in a cake and gifts. But they gathered outside the 100-year-old's window anyway to sing 'Happy Birthday' and make sure she felt their love on the special occasion. Scroll down for video Throwing on a 'Happy Birthday' cowboy hat and holding a sign that read 'Today is My 100th Birthday', Millie was ready to party even if a sheet of glass kept her removed from her adoring family. They crowded around to sing as a nurse brought Millie in a wheelchair over to watch. 'Nothing is stopping the Erickson family from wishing their Matriarch Millie a happy 100th birthday!' the nursing home posted, sharing a video from inside her room as Millie watched her family serenade her. 'We can't go inside to see her because she's quarantined in,' Gary Erickson, her son, toldWCVB. 'It was really nice they let us do this. She doesn't usually cry, but she did. She's just thrilled to see everybody, and she's lived a good long life.' Millie reacted to the birthday treat with a smile, blowing kisses to all as they told their mom, grandmother and great-grandmother that they loved her. Visitations at nursing homes have faced strict restrictions in recent weeks to prevent residents from catching the coronavirus."

The Instagram account @Dogsworkingfromhomefeatures pooches interfering - in the cutest of ways - with their owners' attempts at productive homeworking. The page, set up by brand manager Mark Polchleb, from Melbourne, said having his own pets,Billie and Ollie, at his feet during self-isolation inspired him to ask others to share snaps of how their doting pooches are reacting to their presence. Scroll down for video There's only one rule to those wanting to submit their own photos - the dogs have to be shown in a home setting and can't be pictured being taken out for walkies. And, social media hasn't disappointed, with one snap showing a bespectacled pooch tackling a hefty tome, and two doting golden retrievers staring intently at their owner at work. Polchleb, who has a separate Insta account to document the lives of the two canines he shares with his husband, told theGuardian: 'I just took advantage of the fact that my dogs are at my feet. I thought â€˜we all need a bit of happiness in our lives right now.' After asking owners to contribute their own snaps of how their pets react to them beavering away at a laptop,Polchleb says he was 'inundated' with responses and now has hundreds of adorable photographs to post online.  He said that anyone who owns a dog has probably experienced their inquisitiveness at their owner homeworking, saying: 'I think weâ€™ve all experienced trying to type on the keyboard with the dog edging its head into your hands.' One such submission includes a short video, shared by @hazelnuttini, mother to seven rescue dogs, that shows her fluffy offspring, named Lucky, Tonic, Kim Tan, Flubby, Pugsley, Ginny and Maria, causing merry chaos in her home."
94,"Coronavirus-hit cruise ship with 1,000 mainly British passengers and crew docks in Cuba after it was left stranded for more than a week in the CaribbeanÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126445/Coronavirus-hit-cruise-ship-docks-Cuba-left-stranded.html,"A British cruise ship that has been stranded for more than a week in the Caribbean after several cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed onboard is set to dock in Cuba today to allow weary passengers to disembark and fly home. The mostly British passengers stranded on the COVID 19-stricken MS Braemar will then be repatriated by plane. Britain's Foreign Minister Dominic Raab expressed gratitude on Tuesday in parliament to Communist-run Cuba for offering a safe haven to the ship which has more than 1,000 mainly British passengers and crew aboard, after several Caribbean ports refused to let it dock. Coronavirus has plunged the cruise industry into chaos as the global tightening of entry requirements has left many ships stranded or quarantined. Cruise lines have suspended future trips in recent days. 'Prevention and contention of new coronavirus require the efforts of entire international community,' said Cuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez. 'Let's reinforce health care, solidarity and international cooperation.' Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, which operates the Braemar, said it would dock at the Mariel port, just west of Havana, early on Wednesday. Passengers would return to Britain from the capital's international airport in the evening on four charter flights, it said, including a separate one for passengers who had received a positive diagnosis for coronavirus or displayed any flu-like symptoms. Any not considered well enough to fly would be offered support and medical treatment in Cuba. There are 28 passengers in isolation on the Braemar who have shown influenza-like symptoms, Fred Olsen Cruise Lines said. This includes two people who tested positive for the new coronavirus at its last port of call, Willemstad, Curacao, on March 10. Since then the ship was refused docking in Barbados and the Bahamas, which are both part of the British commonwealth - an irony not lost on some passengers. 'We should all remember what #Cuba has done for us, stepping in when none of the British Commonwealth countries and protectorates in the region offered any help,' tweeted one passenger aboard the Braemar, Steve Dale. The coronavirus has been slower to reach and spread in the Caribbean than much of the rest of the globe. The Cuban government has so far confirmed seven cases in the country, after reporting its first ones last week. Authorities are screening travelers at airports and have stepped up the production of face masks while banning large cultural events. Family physicians are paying more home visits to monitor local communities. Yet the government has not canceled flights from countries hardest hit by the pandemic, restricted internal movement or banned social gatherings, in contrast to other countries in the region, eliciting concern among some Cubans, as has the arrival of the Braemar. 'There were only a few cases ... but now we are filling up on more,' said Pablo Cruz Estrada, 28, while polishing up a 1948 Dodge at a car wash in Havana, known for its vintage U.S. cars. 'Who would come up with such an idea?' "
95,"Prince William and Kate Middleton 'want to help' during the coronavirus outbreak and are set to 'revamp' their work in response, source tells Vanity Fair",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8125929/Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-set-revamp-work-response-coronavirus.html,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 'want to help' and are set to 'revamp' their work in response to the coronavirus outbreak, a source has told Vanity Fair. Kate Middleton, 38, and Prince William, 37, will temporarily divert their attention from their key work, and instead focus on supporting the nation as it tries to cope with the pandemic. A source told royal reporter Katie Nicholl: 'The Cambridges are not in the vulnerable sector and they want to help. Their aides are going through the latest government advice but itâ€™s fair to say the focus of their work will shift.' Katelaunched her Early Years work earlier this year, which was described at the time as a 'lifelong project' for the royal, while Prince William announced further work in the conservation sector in December. The source went on to reveal how the Cambridges were determined to help the vulnerable and provide support to the British public. Explaining the key role the royal family would play in the crisis, the source added that they would be 'very important' in providing stability for the worried nation. They added that Prince William and Kate would prioritise 'supporting the community and vulnerable people in society' in the coming months. The refocus means shifting away from their primary work, which the couple have been focusing more on in the last year. The Duchess spent weeks publicizing herFive Big questions On The Under-Fives survey, which launched in January and promised to guide her future work. She also spoke onGiovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast about heranxieties and spoke of worrying about falling short in parenting. A source told People at the time that the deeply personal conversations were 'not a vanity exercise' but part of her work as a 'credible' voice in the Early Year's space. Meanwhile Prince William launched themulti-million pound Earthshot Prize in December, which was also described as a decade-long project to award of 50 environmental pioneers a cash prize for their work. The comments that the Cambridges would shift focus comes shortly after it was announced the Queen will base herself at Windsor Castle early and will likely stay there beyond the Easter period as she follows advice on coronavirus. Buckingham Palace announced today that the 93-year-old head of state will decamp to the Berkshire royal residence on Thursday - a week earlier than she usually does for Easter Court. The Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace have also been called off and the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party in Edinburgh, which takes place in July, is under review. "
96,Aries should do jumping jacks while Cancers should cuddle with pets: Astrology Instagram account reveals best 'cures' for boredom for each star sign while people remain quarantinedÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8123987/Astrology-meme-account-reveals-best-cures-boredom-star-sign.html,"A popular astrology meme account has revealed the best 'cures' for boredom for each star sign as people around the country remain quarantined inside their homes amid the coronavirus pandemic. Courtney Perkins, the writer behind the Instagram account @notallgeminis, considered the attributes of all 12 astrological signs when she compiled a humorous list of things people can do to keep busy now that they can no longer go out and socialize. 'Itâ€™d be cool if yâ€™all were nice in the comments if I made a mistake but also def trust health professionals over an astrology meme account in terms of life advice,' she captioned the first set of astrology memes. Aries The first sign of the zodiac is ruled by Mars, the planet of desire, action, and energy. Aries are impulsive, passionate, and sometimes bossy, but they never have any problem stealing the spotlight. Keeping that in mind, Courtney chose a wide breadth of physical activities to keep Aries occupied, ranging from energy-burning workouts to intimate self-care. 'Do jumping jacks. Walk around your neighborhood at off-peak hours and keep a safe distance from anyone you may see. Furiously masturbate,' she wrote. Taurus Taurus is the stable, practical, and down-to-earth sign of the zodiac that puts great thought and effort into their relationships. Ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty, a Taurus wants the best of everything and to enjoy life as much as possible. Great food is important for those who are born under this sign and cooking is something that comes naturally to them. Courtney recommended that Tauruses use their free time to cook delicious meals and cuddle up for a movie night. 'Make a cozy a** pillow fort. Learn Molly Baz recipes,' she wrote, referencing the food editor atBon AppÃ©tit. 'Watch the rom-coms of your youth. Snuggle.' Gemini Gemini is the most sociable, communicative, and versatile sign of the zodiac. The sign is ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, technology, and the mind, so it's no wonder Geminis are social butterflies. People who were born under this sign like to flaunt every aspect of their life and keep busy with texts, emails, and instant messages. Knowing that Geminis needs to communicate in some way, Courtney suggested they join Letterboxd, a social network where film lovers can write and share reviews. 'Get a Letterboxd account and go review all of your favorite and least favorite movies. You love offering your opinions and making lists. This is a great way to kill time,' she noted. Cancer Cancers are caring, sensitive, and nurturing by nature. Ruled by the ever-changing moon, Cancers tend to be moody and are constantly changing their emotions. Because they are nurturing and protective of others, they tend to act like an unofficial mom to everyone in their life. Courtney advised bored Cancers to focus on caring for their beloved pets and self-improvement when they're not spending time reminiscing about the past. 'Cuddle with your pets Maybe teach them a new trick,' she wrote. 'Take FaceTime lessons and learn an instrument. Tap into your nostalgia and watch old movies.' Leo Leos are confident, demanding, and leaders of the zodiac. The sign is ruled by the Sun, and naturally, Leos like to be the center of attention. They tend to be spontaneous, and they typically don't think twice about buying a new outfit on a whim if they think it will boost their appearance. Courtney offered Leos a mix of attention-grabbing activities as well as a philanthropical way to clean out their cluttered closets. 'Sing loudly. Find new musicians you like. Call your friends. Tap into your creative side. Take nudes,' she advised. 'Clean out all of the things you haven't worn in six months and vow to take them to the thrift store when it's safe again.' Virgo Virgos are shy, analytical, and perfectionists. They don't speak unless they have something worthy to say. Ruled by Mercury, the planet of mind and communication, Virgos are detail-oriented and have a tendency to analyze everything. Those who are born under this sign are also drawn to service and are never one to shy away from helping someone in need. Courtney suggested that Virgos take the opportunity to challenge themselves in the kitchen while minimizing the need for grocery store runs by using SuperCook, a search engine that lets people find recipes with the ingredients they have at home 'Become a master chef,' she wrote. 'Use SuperCook to search for recipes using only the ingredients you have in your house. Write. Do the project you always say you want to do.' Libra Libras are diplomatic, sociable, and artistic. They are social butterflies who love connecting with others. The sign is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty, and like Venus-ruled Taurus, Libras love to be surrounded by beauty and art. Keeping that in mind, Courtney has advised Libras to put their love of shopping to good use during these uncertain times. 'Shop online. Buy gift cards to places you'll want to buy things from later, and give a present to your future self while supporting the economy,' she suggested. 'Go on a social media spiral of finding new favorite graphic designers and artists.' Scorpio Scorpios are passionate, deep, and mysterious, portraying either a funny or flirty side depending on their mood. Ruled by Pluto, the planet of power and control, Scorpios have an incredible capacity for concentration. Courtney recommended that they pass the time by binge-watching one of the most thrilling series on television. 'Watch all of Killing Eve on Hulu. Season 3 comes back soon and it's full of sexy intrigue and mystery. Things you love!' she noted. Sagittarius Sagittarians are optimistic, adventurous, and humorous, which is what makes them so attractive to other people. The sign is ruled by Jupiter, the planet of expansions and big things. Sagittarians love to travel spend a great deal of their time discovering new and interesting places. Courtney suggested a variety of activities to keep Sagittarians' brains stimulated, including the film review social network Letterboxd. 'Whip out the board games, the puzzles, the crosswords. Read, she advised. 'You crave stimulation. Go find it. You'd like Letterboxd too, opinionated a**... ' Capricorn Capricorns are practical, patient, and matter of fact. Serious in nature, they like to portray an image of being successful. The sign is ruled by Saturn, the planet of tough lessons and wisdom. Capricorns tend to be 'old souls' who are passionate about tradition and following the rules. Courtney stressed that Capricorns should try to stay relaxed while at home, even if that means taking some time away from work. 'Try to give yourself a break from work if you can, or just do it if it makes you feel better,' she wrote. 'Designing a website is fun. Enjoy morally judging the people of Reddit's r/amithea**hole.' Aquarius Aquarians are independent, eccentric, and innovative. They march to the beat of their own drum and can sometimes seem a bit 'out there' to the casual observer. The sign is ruled by Uranus, the planet of freedom and revolutionary vision. In addition to being ahead of their time, Aquarians have a strong humanitarian streak and are always looking to help someone in need. Courtney suggested that cooped up Aquarians stimulate their mind by learning something new or using Flow Free, a brain puzzle app. 'Lose yourself in the mindless joy of the app Flow Free,' she advised. 'Learn the meaning of tarot cards. Watch videos of people doing accent tutorials and learn them. Do every fun face filter video on Instagram. Invest in new meme accounts.' Pisces The last sign of the zodiac is ruled by Neptune, the planet of dreams, fantasy, creativity, and illusion. Pisces are creative, empathetic, imaginative, and spiritual. There is a part of them that always wants to escape reality, whether it is through physical activity or curled up with a good book. Courtney offered activities that will help Pisces relax and tap into their creativity while stuck inside for the foreseeable future. 'Nap, more than usual. Water your plants. Fap. Draw,' she suggested. Search for videos of ""Yoga you can do from you bed,"" then watch them on mute to avoid The YouTube Voice.'"
97,Mother resorts to making her own toilet paper after not being able to find it FOUR TIMES in the supermarket,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8123521/Mum-makes-toilet-paper-not-able-four-times-supermarket.html,"A mum has resorted to making her own toilet paper after four unsuccessful trips to the supermarket to buy rolls for her family - and it only cost her $19. The Australian woman posted on Facebook, where she said she knew she needed to 'find a solution' because she lives in a household of women. 'I found my solution at Bunnings. I made 80 of these microfibre cloths,' the woman wrote. 'After use, they go straight into a bucket of bleach with a lid on it, which sits beside the toilet.' The woman explained that when the bucket is filled with the microfibre cloths, she sticks them all into the washing machine in a separate load with some Napisan. 'A pack of 20 microfibre cloths costs about $11.95 from Bunnings,' she said. To make the cloths, the woman said she cut them into quarters and 'over-locked the raw edges', meaning she got about 80 from the 20 cloths and spent 15 cents each. 'The small bucket with the lid is also from Bunnings and cost $6.50,' she said. While the mum acknowledged that her current toilet paper situation is far from ideal, she said it has its perks insofar as it's environmentally friendly, reusable and reduces flushing - meaning they can save on water. 'Our household alone saves about 25 flushes per day, so I can justify a small load to wash every couple of days,' she said. The mum added that originally she thought about using old towels, but microfibre is 'softer for the feminine bits and dries quicker when washed'. 'If we could all do this, it would reduce the need for toilet paper, save us all money in the long run and be better for the environment,' she said. The woman's post was met with a huge reaction online, where people were quick to applaud her for her clever idea. 'Good on you for doing this, it's an absolutely brilliant idea,' one person posted. 'About time someone got this situation in perspective and highlighted that there are lots of alternatives at our fingertips. Good work,' another person added. Some said that the situation was much like using cloth nappies, while others said they are doing similar with flannels. 'Took us two weeks to find a 12 roll pack... I will probably be doing this next pay to stretch the rolls out. Sad what we have to resort to but will be good in the long run for the environment,' one person posted. Despite her post, the supermarkets have reassured Australians that supplies of toilet paper will not run out, even though they do not last long on the shelves. "
98,Bono pens emotional ballad for Italians in the wake of coronavirus pandemic as he encourages them to 'sing from the rooftops',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8126447/Bono-pens-emotional-ballad-Italians-wake-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"Bono has released a newsong dedicated to Italians who are currently in the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic. The U2 frontman, 59, took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a video singing the ballad as he revealed his inspiration behind the track. The new song, Let Your Love Be Known, is the first music Bono has released since U2's 2017 album, Songs of Experience. Bono revealed that he wrote the song an hour before posting it online, and shared a video of himself performing the tune whilst playing the piano. In the song, which was written on St Patrick's day, Bono described walking through the deserted streets of Dublin. He added that he was fearful of the thought of isolation during the coronavirus outbreak but had been inspired by the footage of quarantined Italians singing to each other from their balconies. Lyrics include: 'You canâ€™t touch but you can sing across rooftops / sing to me down the phone / sing and promise me you wonâ€™t stop / sing and youâ€™re never alone.' Bono shared the video captioned: 'For the Italians who inspired itâ€¦ for the Irishâ€¦ 'for ANYONE who this St. Patrickâ€™s day is in a tight spot and still singing. For the doctors, nurses, carers on the front line, it's you weâ€™re singing to. Bono'. Yes there was silence Yes there was no people here Yes I walk through the streets of Dublin And no one was near Yes I donâ€™t know you No I didnâ€™t think I didnâ€™t care You live so very far away from Just across the square And I canâ€™t reach But I can ring You canâ€™t touch But you can, you can sing Across rooftops Sing down the phone Sing and promise me you wonâ€™t stop Sing your love be known Oh let your love be known Yes there is isolation You and me weâ€™re still here Yes when we open our eyes We will stand down the fear And maybe I said the wrong thing Yes I made you smile I guess the longest distance Is always the last mile And I canâ€™t reach But I can ring You canâ€™t touch But you can, you can sing Across rooftops Sing to me down the phone Sing and promise me you wonâ€™t stop Sing and youâ€™re never alone And again Sing As an act of resistence Sing though your heart is overthrown Sing when you sing there is no distance So let your love be known Oh let your love be known Though your heart is overthrown Let your love be known Last week, thousands of Italians in Rome, Milan, and Naples applauded healthcare workers from their balconies and windows as they raised spirits with a flashmob during the draconian coronavirus lockdown. Families and neighbours also sang and crashed pots and pans together for the performers in cities across the country, organised through messaging service WhatsApp for noon today. Rejoicing spectators exclaimed patriotic and uplifting phrases including 'Viva l'Italia' (Long live Italy) and 'Vinceremo' (we will win). The few cars on the street joined the chorus by blaring their horns. Many also waved banners decorated with rainbows and the phrase 'Andra tutto benne' (everything will go well). The worldwide infection toll for the killer coronavirus topped 200,000 on Wednesday after doubling in less than two weeks. Cases of the highly contagious virus now exceed 203,000, according to data compiled by the John Hopkins University. The global toll reached six figures on March 7, more than two months after the outbreak first began in Wuhan, China, in late December. But another 100,000 people were infected in just 11 days since then, largely due to a surge in cases in Europe, sparking fears the crisis will only continue to get worse. The music industry has been one area affected by the contagious virus, with several festivals and events, including Eurovision, Glastonbury and Coachella cancelled. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.  "
99,Spain will close ALL hotels by Tuesday: Tourists are told to leave NOW as the country's coronavirus death toll reaches 598,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126305/Britons-told-leave-Spain-Madrid-closes-hotels.html,"British tourists have been told to leave Spain within days after the Spanish government announced that all hotels would close from next Tuesday. The Foreign Office today warned British travellers to 'make travel plans to return as soon as possible' after Madrid announced the shutdown. Holidaymakers are urged to 'contact their tour operator or airline as soon as possible' to make arrangements to fly home. Spain has imposed a near-total lockdown and banned people from leaving their homes except to go to work, buy food or receive medical care.  'The Spanish government have confirmed that all hotels will close in Spain from Tuesday 24 March,' the FCO said in a statement. 'We therefore advise British travellers in Spain to contact their tour operator or airline as soon as possible, to arrange their return journey home before this date.' The outbreak in Spain has become the worst in Europe outside Italy, with more than 13,700 people infected and 598 dead. Britons made nearly 19million visits to Spain last year, and many British expats live in the country, meaning many holiday plans are likely to be ruined by the outbreak. Other British tourists are facing a similar struggle to get home from countries including Morocco and Cyprus. Holidaymakers struggling to return home have accused airlines of leaving them stranded and demanding extortionate fees. Tom Widdall, who is in Morocco with his heavily pregnant girlfriend, was due to fly home from Agadir to Manchester on Saturday, but his easyJet flight was cancelled. He said he has been unable to get on to an earlier flight and claimed he has been 'abandoned by easyJet and abandoned by the embassy'. EasyJet told passengers it is 'doing all we can to assist'. Spain has declared a state of alert, shutting all but essential services and ordering its population of 46 million people to stay at home. People are only allowed to go out to buy food or medicine, to go to work or to get medical treatment. Fines for breaching the rules can be up to 30,000 euros (Â£27,200) and a public address system is reinforcing the message in Spanish, Catalan, English and German. Madrid remains the worst-hit area, accounting for 5,637 cases, or 41 percent of the infections in Spain, while the death toll there rose to 390 - around two-thirds of the national total. The number of infections could well be higher, because Spain - like many other countries - has been struggling with a shortage of testing kits. In Madrid alone, the health authorities said they were in touch with more than 20,000 patients by phone. Health minister Fernando Simon said on Tuesday that the patients interviewed were a mixture of 'confirmed and suspected' cases. Spain is now set to receive a new batch of testing kits, meaning medics will 'run tests on anyone showing symptoms,' the health minister said today. The minister warned it could 'substantially increase' the number of positive cases. Earlier, prime minister Pedro Sanchez warned that the virus had not yet peaked in Spain in an address to a nearly-empty parliament. 'The worst is yet to come, as our health system feels the impact of caring for such a huge number of infected people, as the days of isolation drag on, when we feel the economic impact' of the pandemic, he said. 'I am asking you to make sacrifices but I'm also calling for unity... it is what we have to do to save many lives,' he said.  Sanchez's government officially declared the 15-day state of emergency on Saturday. It is only the second such declaration since the country returned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The other time was during a 2010 air traffic controllers' strike. The Foreign Office is now advising against all but essential international travel, including to Spain, because of the coronavirus outbreak."
100,Everything ship shape gentlemen? Queen meets outgoing and incoming captains of her namesake HMS Queen Elizabeth warship during last of her Palace meetings before she self-isolates at Windsor CastleÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126059/Queen-hosts-Buckingham-Palace-meeting-self-isolation.html,"The Queen was seen today at a private audience at Buckingham Palace for her last official engagement before decamping to Windsor for weeks of self-isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 93-year-old head of state greeted Captain Angus Essenhigh, the new Commanding Officer of the Royal Navy warship HMS Queen Elizabeth, and his predecessor Commodore Steven Moorhouse. There were no handshakes, just bows from the captain and the commodore, as they met and chatted with the monarch in the private audience room of the Queen's London home. On Thursday, the Queen will decamp to Windsor Castle, her Berkshire royal residence, as she socially distances herself amid the coronavirus pandemic as the number of UK deaths reached 71 with 1,950 cases. The Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace have also been called off and the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party in Edinburgh, which takes place in July, is under review. The monarch will be based at her favourite home with a reduced household and will be following appropriate advice, a source said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on all people in the UK, particularly the over 70s, to avoid all non-essential contact and travel as part of unprecedented peacetime measures aimed at trying to control the spread of Covid-19. Elizabeth II, the nation's longest reigning monarch, is due to celebrate her 94th birthday next month, and the risk of more severe symptoms from the coronavirus is greater for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.  Investitures will be rearranged and the annual Maundy Service at St George's Chapel has been cancelled, the palace said. Future audiences will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, the palace said. She is not the only royal affected by the Government's new advice.Heir to the throne the Prince of Wales is 71 and the Duchess of Cornwall is 72. Other working royals include the Queen's cousins the Duke of Gloucester, 75, the Duke of Kent, 84, and Princess Alexandra, 83.

The palace said in a statement: 'As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, a number of changes are being made to the Queen's diary. 'Her Majesty will move to Windsor Castle for the Easter period on Thursday 19 March, one week earlier than planned. It is likely the Queen will stay there beyond the Easter period. 'In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, a number of public events with large numbers of people due to have been attended by the Queen, and other members of the royal family, in the coming months will be cancelled or postponed.' An investiture had been due to take place at the palace on Wednesday. Sixty-one recipients, accompanied by guests, were due to gather in the ballroom to collect a range of accolades, from MBEs to knighthoods and damehoods. The Easter period is expected to be a quiet one for the monarch, as is usual, a source said. Each year, the Queen takes up official residence in Windsor for a month over Easter between March and April, known as Easter Court. The Queen also usually hosts a Dine and Sleep event during her stay when guests are given a bed for the night in the castle, but this will undoubtedly not take place. Famous guests in the past have included director Tim Burton, actress Helena Bonham Carter, Bond star Daniel Craig and actress Rachel Weisz. On Friday, Her Majesty's upcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden were postponed because of thecoronaviruspandemic. She is also said to have been advised to cancel her annual garden parties in May and June in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Earlier this month the Queen is reported to have vowed not to let the outbreak stop her from performing her duties and to set an example by 'keeping calm and carrying on' until there is 'compelling advice to the contrary'.

'Whilst these are not confirmed cases we feel that this is a prudent step that prioritises the health and wellbeing of our employees and visitors. 'We continue to monitor the situation and Government's public health guidance closely. The rest of Windsor Great Park remains open as usual.' ThePrince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall had already pulled out of their spring overseas tour just days before it was due to begin. The Queen was due to visit the Bentley Motors Factory in Crewe, and the Jodrell Bank Observatory and Square Kilometre Array Global Headquarters in Macclesfield on March 19.She was also due to visit Camden on March 26, but full details of the trip had not yet been released.

'In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, Her Majesty's forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden will be rescheduled. 'Audiences will continue as usual. Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice.'

The day of engagements next Thursday would have seen the monarch travel to Cheshire to meet staff and apprentices at the Bentley factory, operate the Lovell Telescope at the observatory and meet local school children engaging in hands on science activities.

Charles was set to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina on March 17 and 18, be joined by Camilla in Cyprus from March 18 to 21, and head to Jordan together until March 25. 'Owing to the unfolding situation with the coronavirus pandemic the British government has asked their royal highnesses to postpone their Spring tour,' a spokesman for the royal couple said yesterday.

The news comes after Charles shared a Namaste bow with Baroness Floella Benjamin on Thursday amid the coronavirus pandemic, as she collected her damehood at Buckingham Palace. The pair were spotted exchanging the greeting, which avoids any unnecessary touching of hands, during the investiture ceremony. Known to millions as the host of Play School and Play Away, Baroness Benjamin, a beloved children's TV presenter, was recognised for her services to charity in the New Year Honours List. The Liberal Democrat life peer has dedicated over 40 years to campaigning for young people and supports charities including Barnardo's, Sickle Cell Society and Beating Bowel Cancer. After receiving her damehood, the 70-year-old, from London, said: 'You get such a buzz from giving back and making a difference, changing the world, and to get an honour like this after these years it's like wonderful recognition. 'Today, it's giving me a wonderful feeling in my heart. I haven't done charity work for any ulterior motive but only to change people's lives. 'To get it, it is like wow, how exciting. But I'm still thinking: what more can I do? To me, it doesn't end here.' A 'huge admirer' of Prince Charles, Baroness Benjamin said she was 'thrilled' to receive her damehood from him on Thursday."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation on Monday to warn against social gatherings in public places in an attempt to mitigate the deadly virus' spread. However, the Gypsy King took it upon himself to nip out with close friend and fellow boxer Isaac Lowe to celebrate the feast of Saint Patrick. The 31-year-old was in a joyful mood as he sank pints while wishing his followers a happy St Paddy's Day on Instagram. Fury has been on top of the boxing world since his emphatic win over Deontay Wilder last month. The Manchester-born heavyweight claimed the WBC heavyweight title, completing a remarkable comeback from his battle with substance abuse and depression. However, while things are looking up for Fury, they could be tumbling down just as quickly as he faces an investigation into fresh claims about previous doping charges. As revealed by Sportsmail, Fury and his cousin Hughie Fury are facing explosive allegations that a member of their team allegedly offered a farmer Â£25,000 to lie about how they each failed a drugs test in 2015. While the national doping watchdog is remaining tight-lipped, Sportsmail understands they are set to act on the extraordinary new information brought to light by the Mail on Sunday. If the Furys are found guilty of a potential new charge of tampering with the initial investigation - which led to backdated two-year bans for the Furys in 2017 for their nandrolone positives - then they would each be facing possible eight-year suspensions for a second offence. It comes after the startling claims of Lancashire farmer Martin Carefoot, who says he lied when he submitted two written statements to the Furys' legal team in 2017 to say he had supplied the fighters with uncastrated wild boar. The defence blamed the presence of nandrolone metabolites on the 'ingestion of offal of uncastrated wild boar or pig, or alternatively from contaminated supplements'. The Furys have not yet addressed the allegations, which include a claim from Carefoot that he was promised Â£25,000 from a member of their entourage, via a friend, for his complicity. 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES The Olympic torch relay in Greecewascancelled on Friday March 13 - just a day after the flame was lit in Olympia.

103,'What does a toilet paper shortage mean?' Friends who went rafting off the grid in the Grand Canyon for 25 days are 'trying to piece the world together' as they return to learn about coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125969/Friends-went-rafting-grid-Grand-Canyon-25-days-return-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"A group of rafters have emerged from a 25-day trip in the Grand Canyon to learn the coronavirus outbreak has turned into a global pandemic. California man Zach Edler, 27, Mason Thomas, 29, and Sarah Knaack, are some of a group that were blissfully unaware of how COVID-19 has changed the way of life in America and other parts of the world, while they stayed off the grid from February 19 to March 14. While the friends are concerned for loved ones and the devastation going on in the world, in some ways they wish they could go back to blissful ignorance. 'We had so much fun. We lived in the moment. We were some of the only people in the world who had no idea. I liked it better then,' Elder, a raft guide and part-time elementary-school teacher, told the New York Times. They only learned about the panic shopping and business closures from another guide upon completion of the journey in Arizona. 'He gave us a look, sighed, and then launched into it,' Elder explained. 'Half of us thought he was joking. It's like, here's an old river guide pulling our leg. I mean, I've heard some pretty big tales out on the river.' Knaack, who is a nurse, described a feeling of 'disbelief' but says the women on the trip recognized that it was not a prank, sooner than the men. Still they didn't realize the extent to which the pandemic had affected their usual lives. 'I think the girls believed it right away,' Knaack told the Times. 'He said it in this real ominous way but then he just walked away to see about lunch and we were left nervously joking with ourselves totally unsure what was going on.'

Sports games and other events have been canceled as states ban public gatherings of large groups. Thomas said the moment he realized the pandemic level was when they first received cell phone service outside of the canyon and a text came through from his mother. 'The first one was from my mom,' Thomas said. 'It was like, ""You need to text me the second you get this. The world is going crazy.""' She's immunocompromised so I was definitely worried.' He added: 'We're sitting here trying to piece the world together. What does a toilet paper shortage mean? Why are they out of toilet paper?' The reality was evident when the friends stopped off at a hotel for the night and staff were being protective of tissue rolls that have been scarce in some supermarkets around the world. 'The lady at the hotel was like, ""We have toilet paper; just don't steal it."" And the TV was showing some sports game from the '80s or something and it was this reminder that, ""Oh, everything's canceled"",' Ms. Knaack said. 'It's like, ""How'd we go from paradise to hoarding rice and beans?"" She said that after another rafter accessed Amazon.com on their phone to search for toilet roll and it wasn't available: 'That was a moment where it felt pretty real.' Take-out and drive-thru restaurant use is being encouraged to prevent the spread of coronavirus and restrictions as tightening by the day. On Saturday the group started experiencing the panic others have felt for the several weeks they were exploring the Grand Canyon. 'It's just like this whirlwind of information,' Edler explained about a simple trip to In 'N' Out Burger in Kingman, Arizona. 'You're overwhelmed being in public for the first time and then you have this virus to think about. I'm standing in line for a burger and looking around thinking, ""So, is it here right now?""' The friends said that often before going on trip that take them off the grid they joke that they could come back to a world that is drastically different to when they left. 'Of course, it never happens. Except for this time. This time it did,' Elder said. They knew about coronavirus but Thomas says he 'figured if it was bad maybe we'd just all be washing our hands even more or something more serious. But not this'. Thomas has been trying to 'stay away from the full fire hose of news' as they're forced into reality. They see the trip as a positive and as Knaack gets ready to go back into the medical field where professionals are needed now more than ever, she thinks it good that she got in a vacation while she could. 'There was probably less overall stress and worry this way,' Knaack told the Times. 'We rafted the Grand Canyon, so there are no regrets at all,' Edler said. 'Some people wouldn't like this but I loved that blissful ignorance. It allows you to enjoy the beauty of life.' 'It would be worse to have been sitting and stewing in it,' Thomas added. It's a similar experience toJared Leto, who has been left stunned after emerging from a 12-day desert retreat to discover the spread of coronavirus has now become a global pandemic. The 48-year-old Oscar winner was shocked to learn that much of the world was taking extreme measures to fight COVID-19, with countless people self-isolating at home. The Hollywood star shared his thoughts on social media shortly after being reunited with his smartphone. 'Wow. 12 days ago I began a silent meditation in the desert. We were totally isolated. No phone, no communication etc. We had no idea what was happening outside the facility,' he began. 'Walked out yesterday into a very different world. One that's been changed forever. Mind blowing - to say the least. I'm getting messages from friends and family all around the globe and catching up on what's going on. Leto's 4.3 million Twitter followers wouldn't have known that he was incommunicado, as he had multiple tweets scheduled to post while he was silently meditating.

104,Instagram influencer with 1.3 million followers reveals she has coronavirus after live-streaming her test she got from doctor friend despite normal Americans being turned away,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8126131/Influencer-tests-positive-COVID-19-getting-test-doctor-friend.html,"A New York City-based fashion influencer has caused outrage after she managed to get tested for the novel coronavirus thanks to her personal connections â€” even while there is a shortage of tests across the US and other Americans are being turned away by doctors. Arielle Charnas, who has 1.3 million Instagram followers and afashion line at Nordstrom called Something Navy, revealed on the social media platform on Monday that she was experiencing symptoms like sore throat and fever. But while symptoms alone aren't enough for most other Americans to get one of the limited available tests, Charnas called up a doctor friend who bent the rules for her â€” and theunfairness is infuriating some social media users. Charnas posted video in her Instagram stories on Monday, saying she was experiencing a sore throat, headache, fever, chills. A doctor told her to treat herself at home and 'quarantine herself' â€” but didn't offer a test. The US is currently short on available tests, which are being allocated to the most at-risk individuals â€” meaning many younger, healthier patients who come down with COVID-19 symptoms are being denied tests and told to simply quarantine themselves. But Charnas reached out to a friend, Dr. Jake Deutsch, who runs the Cure Urgent Care facility on the Upper West Side â€” and he told her to stop by for testing. She documented the trip, pullingup in car with her husband Brandon as a health professional performed the test through the window. Later, she updated followers to say that while a flu test came back negative, she tested positive for COVID-19. 'I wanted to give you all a health update,' she wrote. 'This morning, I learned that I tested positive for COVID-19. 'While the virus seems to be everywhere that you turn, it's meaning and importance completely changes when it affects you personally. 'Now that I've officially tested positive, here is my plan per the recommendation of my doctors: Continue to quarantine/self-isolate, get lots of rest and drink fluids, get in touch with the family and friends that I've been in close contact with over the past 2 weeks so they can be even more diligent in their own self-quarantine and look out for any symptoms. She said her two daughters weren't showing symptoms, but her husband is also unwell. She added that she's had a sore throat, chest heaviness, a low-grade fever that last two days, headache, sinus pressure, zero appetite, body aches, and skin sensitivity. 'We are truly living in an unprecedented time, but if social media has shown us anything in the past couple of days, it's that we are all in this together.' She also addressed those who are upset that she managed to get a test, but mistook the anger as being about her ability to access healthcare when others can't â€” rather than the fact that she used a powerful connection to get a test that is being rationed for the most vulnerable. 'I realize that there are many individuals, both in New York City, and nationwide, who do not have the ability to receive immediate medical care at the first sign of sickness, and access to care is #1 priority in a time like this.' 'It is the responsibility of our government offices to ensure all American can access necessary tests and I acknowledge how lucky I am to have had that access.' Meanwhile, other peopleacross the US have been denied tests, despite showing symptoms just like Charnas. 'The idea of anybody getting [the test] easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that,'Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last week. 'Do I think we should be? Yes. But we are not. 'The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing.' After Vice President Mike Pence said that there was 'no barrier' to testing and anyone who's doctor ordered a test could get one, doctorscame forward to say that, baed on on-the-ground experience, that was 'totally false.' Yet still, severalrich, famous, powerful, and connected people have managed to get tests while others can't. Last week, some scoffed when New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Fox News: 'It almost seems like the more wealthy and powerful you are, the more able you are to access a test.' Yet there are multiple reports of these wealthy and powerful people avoiding the limitations that face the wider population. The Utah Jazz NBA team got 58 players and staffers tested after one of their own, Rudy Gobert, was diagnosed with the disease. According to the Daily Beast, that was nearly 60 per cent of the stateâ€™s daily testing ability â€” and 20 per cent of their total available tests. Kris Jenner was also tested after she attended the birthday party for someone who tested positive. She, however, tested negative. Heidi Klum's husbandTom Kaulitz and singer Celine Dion have tested negative as well. Idris Elba announced on March 16 that he had tested positive, as have Matthew Broderick's sister Janet, Universal Music chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge, Nets star Kevin Durant, and three unidentified Nets teammates."

106,Chinese people come up with creative hairstyles to help secure their masks because their ears hurt from holding the face covers for too long,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8125495/Chinese-come-hairstyles-hold-face-masks-protect-ears.html,"Chinese people have come up with a series of creative hairstyles to help hold their masks while they are at work. A humorous video demonstrates the different ways people can use to spare their ears from hurting after they wear the face covers for a whole day. Women are seen tying their hair into buns while some men resort to hairbands or even bath towels. The video has amused millions of Chinese people after it was shared on social media platforms. 'This is too funny! These people are adorable,' one comment read. Another said: 'They are very creative people. Now I want to try this!' Chinese bloggers have also uploaded hair and makeup tutorials to teach people how to style themselves while wearing face masks. This came after officials in China ordered their citizens to wear face masks regularly to contain the spread of the disease. Millions of Chinese residents have resumed work after the country is now deemedto be under control during the escalatingcoronaviruspandemic. Beijing reported just one new domestic case yesterday in comparison to 15,152 just five weeks ago while the number of deaths and infections in Europe continue to soar. Meanwhile, the killer virus has claimed at least 71 deaths and infected nearly 2,000 people in the UK. The coronavirus pandemic has now infected more than 200,000 people around the globe after doubling in less than two weeks. Between the start of the outbreak in December and March 7, there were 100,000 confirmed cases recorded. But another 100,000 people have been infected in just 11 days since then, largely due to a surge in cases in Europe. The John Hopkins University, which announced cases had surpassed the 200,000 mark, also recorded 8,006 deaths. The current death toll suggests 4 per cent of patients who catch the virus die from it. But experts say the death rate is probably lower than that becausethe true number of infections is much higher. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
107,Sisters dubbed the 'world's most identical twins' who share a bed and boyfriend reveal they only eat ONCE a day and do six-hour workouts even though they know it's 'unhealthy'Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8126221/Worlds-identical-twins-share-bed-boyfriend-reveal-eat-day.html,"A pair of twins who have been dubbed 'the most identical in the world' have revealed they only eat one meal a day and work out for six hours everyday. Anna and Lucy DeCinque, 34, from Perth, Australia, said they were 'addicted to exercise' and 'often feel exhausted' as a result of their draining lifestyles. Speaking on their YouTube channel the twins, who share a bed with their joint boyfriend Ben, 39, said they become stressed when they can't exercise. Lucy said: 'We only eat once a day, we know that's bad. 'It comes from our mum. We know that's unhealthy but we only eat at night.' Anna added: 'Whatever works for you works for you. Everybody can take things differently. Everything in moderation.' They added that they don't encourage their followers to copy their unhealthy habits. 'We exercise too much. We are addicted to exercise. The scary excessive kind,' the explained. 'We went on the treadmill for two hours, then we weight trained for two hours, then we walked around the house.It took up most of the day. 'Today we were so exhausted we couldn't even get up.' 'The other day we were so exhausted we couldn't really finish the workout but we did anyway.' They added their doctor has told them off, and they 'tend to go overboard' with things. The twins previously revealed they share a bed with their boyfriend of nine years, Ben Byrne. Speaking onAustralian TV programmeHughesy, We Have a Problem, last year they discussed their relationship with the mechanic who they first started dating in 2012. The sisters, who live with Ben and their mother said on the show: 'We sleep in a king size bed, bigger than a king size bed - about six inches more.' They said that they would sleep either side of Ben and when host Dave Hughes asked if they were both present when the other had sex they replied 'yes.' Lucy added: 'There's no jealousy in the relationship if Ben will kiss Anna he will kiss me Lucy.' Anna added: 'Ben accepts us he doesn't mind that we dress alike and want to be together, he doesn't judge us. 'We always have each others backs there's always two against one. He gets double the love double the attention.' The sisters also expressed their desire to marry their longterm boyfriend, however polygamy is banned under the Australian Marriage Act 1961. 'Okay, so we share a partner Ben and we would like marry him one day but the law in Australia says we can't, so what do we do?"" they told the panel. The twins uploaded the sneak peek of the appearance with the caption: 'We share a unique problem. WE WANT TO MARRY THE SAME MAN.' Hughes and two other fellow guests struggled to wrap their heads around the sisters' plight laughing and cracking jokes about their unusual issue. The siblings, who splashed out nearly $250,000 (Â£138,917) on cosmetic surgery to make themselves look more alike before reversing the effects, went on to detail the lengths they go to stay identical. Lucy said: If she goes to the toilet I have to go at the same time because we eat and drink the same, we shower together, we're just never apart. 'It's stressful being us, we have to measure our plates, every thing has to be identical.' The sisters went on to admit that they even plan to be pregnant at the same time, claiming it's 'Ben's job' to make sure that happens. The sisters first found fame after they spent thousands on matching surgery to remain identical. When they reached their 20s, the sisters opted for years of lip fillers, breast implants, facial tattooing, skin needling, laser treatments and even eyebrows and hair extensions. But the twins - who once had 14 beauty procedures in two weeks - later decided to have their eyebrow and lip tattoos removed and let their fillers dissolve after realising they'd overdone the procedures.

108,Tekashi 69 gets sued by Fashion Nova for hiding his criminal dealings from them before going to jail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8124257/Tekashi-69-gets-sued-Fashion-Nova-hiding-criminal-dealings-going-jail.html,"While Tekashi 69 awaits his August 2020 release from prison, he's facing a new lawsuit from Fashion Nova. The 23-year-old rapper (real name Daniel Hernandez) is being sued by the discount clothing retailer for $2.25 million, according to documents obtained by TMZ. The fashion brand had signed a deal with the rapper for a series of promotions on his social media pages, but that happened just weeks before he was sent to prison. After he was locked up, Tekashi was unable to perform the duties set forth in his deal, and the company claims his testimony during the trial destroyed his ability to become a good 'brand ambassador.' Hernandez was paid a $225,000 advance for his services in October 2018, but after his arrest, he promised to return the advance and never did. The fashion brand is claiming Tekashi concealed his entire criminal prosecution from them, and now they're suing for $2.25 million. Back in February 2019, the rapper plead guilty to nine charges included toconspiracy to murder and armed robbery, and he was facing up to 47 years in prison. He sent a personal letter to the judge using his given name, asking for a second chance, and it seemed to have worked. The Gummo rapper was sentenced to 24 months, with 13 months credit for time served, with 11 months left that would have lead to his release in November 2020. The New York Bureau of Prisons gives inmates 54 days off a sentence per year if they exhibit good behavior. The rapper's lawyer, Lance Lazzaro, told TMZin December that he believes his client will be released in August 2020. The judge said that he had cooperated remarkably, but his conduct was too violent to let him off with just time already served, leading to the two-year sentence. Hernandez has been no stranger to legal issues, having plead guilty in 2015 to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance. He was also arrested on weapons, racketeering and drug charges in 2018. He first came into prominence with his 2017 single Gummo, which was certified platinum and lead to his mixtape Day 69 and his album Dummy Boy in 2018."

110,Uzbek princess once one of the world's richest women and a friend of British royal family is jailed for 13 years after $2.2billion corruption trialÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8126711/Uzbek-princess-jailed-13-years-1-7-billion-corruption-trial.html,"A glamorous Uzbek 'princess' with links to the British royals and London's high society has been jailed for 13 years in a Â£1.7 billion corruption trial. Gulnara Karimova, 46, daughter of former tyrannical Uzbekistan ruler Islam Karimov, was sentenced by a secret court in Tashkent. A former billionaire, she was once believed to be the USSR's richest woman and was a friend of Queen's cousin Prince Michael of Kent. The former British ambassador to the country - nicknamed 'Corruptistan' under her father's rule - described the then all-powerful 'princess' as a beautiful but deadly James Bond villainess. 'Gulnara Karimova is one hell of a package,' said Craig Murray. 'Richer than Paris Hilton, undeniably smarter and arguably sexier - and I've met both. 'Harvard MBA, owner of scores of businesses, martial arts black belt, fluent in four languages, professional jewellery designer, poet and performer of a number one hit pop single. 'Her muscle-bound boyfriend walks respectfully behind her, head bowed.' She mixed in British high society with tycoon Nat Rothschild and actor Jude Law, among others. A neighbour at her Â£30million Gorse Hill Manor mansion in Surrey was Sir Bruce Forsyth. Described in US diplomatic cables as a 'robber baron', she had been tipped to succeed her late father as president but he suddenly turned on her after hearing the scale of her alleged corruption. He slapped her in the face, after which she was banished from view in the cotton and gas-rich central Asian state. She has been shut away behind barbed wire in bleak penal colony number 21 in Tashkent region. At a trial that has been ongoing for years she was accused of fraudulently acquiring assets worth Â£455 million and receiving Â£664 million in kickbacks paid into offshore accounts. The total value of her alleged theft from the people of Uzbekistan was put at more than Â£1.7 billion. She was convicted of organising a criminal group, extortion, embezzlement by misappropriation, and legalisation of income derived from criminal activities. Five accomplices were also jailed. The Uzbek government has confiscated some Â£1 billion of her assets. From his London exile, her 28 year old son Islam Karimov Jr accused the Uzbek authorities of seeking to kill Karimova, alleging she was a victim of vengeance by jealous cronies of her father. 'They want to eliminate her, most likely by poisoning,' he alleged. Last month Karimova begged her father's successor President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to permit her release, citing ill health and an urgent need for surgery. Her 13 year sentence will be counted from 2015 when she was detained. "
111,'Oprah would have never made it in the UK': Jameela Jamil explains why she had to move to America to crack the entertainment industry,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8125321/Jameela-Jamil-says-Oprah-Winfrey-never-U-K.html,"Jameela Jamil has said chat show host Oprah Winfrey, 66, would have 'never made it' in the U.K because of the lack of diversity in the entertainment industry. The Good Place actress, 34, explained why she felt she had to move over the U.S to pursue her career in television, in an interview with Playboy Magazine. Jameela said: 'We're still behind in giving women important jobs that lead to long standing, dignified careers, the rest of us either get pushed out or get pushed into being nothing more than sex objects, whether we want that or not. 'I remember coming to America five years ago and seeing (black US broadcaster) Robin Roberts hosting Good Morning America and knowing that Oprah is a really big deal (in the US) - Oprah would never have made it in the UK. 'I couldn't believe that I was seeing women in their 50s and 60s of different races on the biggest shows on US television. That was a big moment.' Jameela claimed she knew she had to move over to the U.S because if she had stayed in the U.K. she would have been sent to the 'glue factory'. The television personality was born in Hampstead to a Muslim Indian father and a Muslim Pakistani mother. Aged 23, Jameela began her career on T4, where she hosted a pop culture series from 2009 until 2012. She then became the radio host of The Official Chart, and was co-host of The Official Chart Update alongside Scott Mills on BBC Radio 1. Jameela was the first solo female presenter of the BBC Radio 1 chart show. Following a breast cancer scare, Jamil left London and moved to Los Angeles, with no plans of acting, instead intending to work as a screenwriter. Her agent told her Michael Schur, who co-created Parks and Recreation, was looking for a British actress for a new upcoming comedy series. The show premiered in September 2016, with Jamil being a regular cast member of the NBC fantasy comedy series The Good Place, where she plays Tahani Al-Jamil, alongside Kristen Bell and Ted Danson. Jamil's character became known for her tendency to name drop. Jameela's outspoken interview comes after she hit back at trolls who claimed she would be the 'first actress to catch coronavirus' because of her long history with ailments. The Good Place star took to Twitter last week to share a slew of Tweets predicting she would be one of the first celebrities to say they have been struck down with COVID-19. Jameela vented:'If youâ€™re gonna make a joke about how I am going to be the first actress with coronavirus, ya late and ya basic.  'Joking about my mental and physical health doesnâ€™t hurt me as much as other more vulnerable people with chronic illness/invisible disability/actual Munchausens (sic).'"
112,"Visit the 'most exclusive destination on earth'... for $200k: Tourists offered chance to explore deepest spot in the oceans - the Mariana Trench, which sits at a depth of 35,000ft",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-8125303/Tourists-offered-chance-explore-35-000ft-deep-Mariana-Trench-Eyos-Expeditions.html,"The Mariana Trench is the deepest spot in the world's oceans and only a handful of people have been there. But for the first time, travellers are being offered the opportunity to explore its most extreme area - if they have a spare $100,000 to $200,000 (Â£83,000 to Â£166,000). Isle of Man-based Eyos Expeditions is offering three members of the public the chance to tag along on a dive it's organising to the deepest spot in the Western Pacific trench, known as Challenger Deep - 35,853ft (10,928 metres/6.79 miles) beneath the surface. It is, the company says, the most exclusive destination on the planet. The lucky three travellers will fly to the Pacific island of Guam.From there, they will board the expedition vessel, DSSV Pressure Drop, and spend a day at sea before reaching the Mariana Trench. The expedition, which is set to take place in June, will then use a submersible vehicle called Limiting Factor to dive to the bottom of Challenger Deep. The vehicle has been pressure-tested to 14,000 metres (45,931ft/8.69 miles) and has already dived to the bottom of the Mariana Trench five times. According to Eyos Expeditions, which has teamed up with Caladan Oceanic for the trip, the occupants of the submersible are completely protected by the 90mm-thick titanium sphere and 'experience no pressure changes or physiological stresses at all'. The firm adds: 'Indeed, the inside of the sub is quiet, peaceful and very relaxing. 'The sub has two comfortable seats, three viewports, and hi-definition surround cameras.' Each dive will take up to 14 hours.  The descent takes over four hours. Once at the bottom the group will get to potentially film some of the most extraordinary species on the planet. They will then begin a four-hour ascent back to the surface. Only seven people in the past have ever made it to the bottom of Mariana Trench - one being Hollywood film director James Cameron in 2012. No formal pre-departure training is required, and those taking part will receive a comprehensive shipboard and sub orientation as part of the pre-dive preparations. Rob McCallum, founding partner of Eyos Expeditions, said: 'This is the most exclusive destination on earth. 'Currently, only three manned expeditions have ever been made to the bottom of Challenger Deep and more people have been to the moon than to the bottom of the ocean. Four thousand people have been to Everest and 562 to space - only seven have made it to Challenger Deep. 'This will be a rare and special opportunity to participate in and help fund genuine exploration in the modern age. 'These three mission specialists joining the expedition will be at the forefront of our continued scientific research into the oceanâ€™s virtually unknown hadal zone [the ocean below 6,000m/3.72 miles/19,685ft], and demonstrate the power of private travel to advance our understanding of the planet. 'Whilst onboard [the mother vessel], the mission specialists will be fully integrated members of the team and free to work alongside our sonar operator/ocean mappers, submersible technicians, film production team, expedition management and shipâ€™s officers to gain an insight into the complexities and challenges of hadal exploration. 'Tracking and communicating with the sub is a great way to spend the day, as is the launch and recovery sequence, which is an â€œall handsâ€ activity. 'When we are not diving, we relax by taking in a movie, heading to the gym, reading, or heading up to the Sky Bar for a sundowner.' The dive is part of a much longer six-month-long Ring of Fire expedition Eyos and Caladan Oceanic are operating. Ben Lyons, Eyos Expeditionsâ€™ CEO, said: 'The Ring of Fire expedition will continue the groundbreaking work of the Five Deeps Expedition (FDE) last year. 'Its collective mission is to verify and test the deepest points possible, collect and analyze scientific samples, and extend humankindâ€™s knowledge of the most extreme environment on earth. 'Pressure Drop will further contribute to science with powerful full-ocean-depth sonar - Kongsberg EM-124. It can produce high-resolution 3D maps of the deepest seafloor in order to further our knowledge of the oceans.' The science team - led by Five Deeps veteran Dr. Alan Jamieson from Newcastle University - will deploy landers [robotic submersibles] to collect further biological samples and shoot valuable video footage. This continues the work of the FDE where over 40 new species have already been identified, with this number expected to rise significantly as the samples are processed. The dives will also continue to assess and document environmental impact (including plastic pollution) at the deepest point of the oceans. On the Limiting Factorâ€™s previous dives to Challenger Deep, both new species and discarded plastic were found. Eyos Expeditionsâ€™ team has cumulatively completed over 1,200 expeditions, and will plan, manage and lead all aspects of the voyage including logistical support, team travel and permits. Last year Eyos led a dive to the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean to assess how microbial life was eating away at the wreck. But it was reported that a submarine hired by the company struck the legendary ocean liner due to 'intense and highly unpredictable currents'. An Eyos Expedition leader confirmed that there had been contact with the Titanic but said that any damage to the remains would have been minor. Guests interested in joining the Mariana Trench expedition should contact EYOS Expeditions for pricing and full details at info@eyos.com. For more information visit www.eyos.com."

The EuropeanSeismological Centre (EMSC) said the quake was at a depth of 10 kilometres. It struck at 1:45 am (1745 GMT) with an epicenter 255 kilometres south of the town of Nusa Dua, the US Geological service said. Indonesia's weather and geophysics bureau said there was no tsunami threat. No casualties or infrastructure damage have been reported so far, but the quake was strongly felt across the holiday island. A hotel staffer Indra Kurniawan just got home from work when the jolt shook his boarding house in Canggu, Bali. 'The shaking was not that powerful but ones could feel it. It lasted not more than a minute,' he told AFP. The Southeast Asian archipelago is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. Indonesia suffers frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire', where tectonic plates collide. More than 2,200 people died and another 1,000 were declared missing in 2018 after a 7.5 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Sulawesi island. A 9.1 magnitude earthquake on December 26 in 2004 struck Aceh province, causing a tsunami that claimed the lives of more than 170,000 people in Indonesia alone."

The award-winning record producer, 44, first purchased the property for $4.295 million (Â£3.5 million) in December 2016, with the musician originally aiming to make over a $1 million (Â£832,000) profit by putting it up for sale in October last year for $5.395 million (Â£4.4 million). The mansion's new owner is set to live in the lap of luxury as the lavish abode is complete with a sprawling outdoor swimming pool, a home spa and retro interiors - featuring DJ Mark's typically eclectic style.  Designed by architect William Asa Hudson in 1935, the home and a two-storey poolside guesthouse is situated on almost a third of an acre, protected by sturdy gates. Mark's former property doesn't hold back on the extravagant front, featuring four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a colourful dining room and a state-of-the-art kitchen. The Shallow hitmaker's love for nature is displayed through the exterior plant arrangement, which features a selection of traditional palm trees. One of the bedroom's balcony looks out to the large body of water, where guests can unwind by topping up their tans in the sunny state. Chained lights, paisley-printed bean bags and a navy marble-style countertop occupies another outdoor space, with striped curtains attached to encourage shade. While the kitchen maintains a relatively vintage aesthetic, animal-print walls and kooky artwork inject a pop of colour to the room. A variety of dining options are available, as a secondary room attached to the kitchen is complete with a circular-framed table and monochrome seating. The songwriter's step-down living room takes a step back in time with its velvet furnishings and a classically grand piano, while vibrant chandeliers, avant garde artwork and a fireplace also serve as the stand-out features of the room. Guests are greeted to a multi-coloured statue, a French-inspired staircase and wild print wallpaper as they enter the main foyer. Mark's purchase comes after he revealedhe would trade his success in the music industry to start a family of his own. The media personality explained how working in the studio 'fills a void' inside him as he often forms close relationships with his collaborators but he would trade his achievements for children. He told Radio Times: 'I've never thought that [work] was a replacement for having a family of my own, but I definitely think it fills some of that void more than if I was going to an office. 'I do have these warm relationships that maybe [satisfy] part of my soul that needs fulfilling. But believe me, I'd trade it in for kids.' The Uptown Funk hitmaker - whose five-year marriage to JosÃ©phine de La Baume ended in 2017 - previously admitted his latest record, Late Night Feelings, was inspired by his divorce as he was able to channel his sadness into the record. He said: 'It's a break-up album. Every time I went to the studio I'd throw out ideas and some were light-hearted things but the ones staying with me all had melancholy. 'You really have to go through something kind of f***-up to make good art sometimes ... it's not necessarily always how I've operated. I think the idea of being a little bit rocked out of your comfort zone is a good thing.' The star recently quipped he'll make a similar album if he gets dumped again. Asked if he will 'remain in this mindset' for future records, he said: 'I think every record is always kind of hard to imagine where you're going to be ... it's a different time [unless] I get dumped between this and the next album.' In the romance department, Mark is said to be in a relationship with actress Genevieve Gaunt.The artist and his ex Rebecca Schwartz went their separate ways after seven months of dating in May last year."
116,'I look forward to it... living is probably more complicated': Boxing legend Mike Tyson opens up on death and how being famous was 's***',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-8122217/Heavyweight-boxing-legend-Mike-Tyson-reveals-looking-forward-death.html,"Mike Tyson has revealed he is looking forward to the day he dies as 'life is more complicated'. The boxing legend has had a rollercoaster life in and outside of the ring and recently admitted how retiring from the sport has left him feeling like a shell of the man who once ruled the heavyweight division. At his peak, Tyson was the most ferocious and destructive puncher on the planet and became the youngest ever heavyweight world champion at 20 years old. He was also the first heavyweight to hold the WBA, WBC and IBF belts and later became the lineal champion. Tyson's life spiralled out of control after he was beaten by James Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in boxing's history. The American was convicted of rape and jailed two years later before returning to the sport in 1995. He would recapture the world title but was never quite the same. Reflecting on his career and his life, Tyson admitted he does not fear death, telling The Sportsman: 'From my experience, from what I believe, the more I know about not existing, the more willing I am to die. 'Yeah [I look forward to it], I don't fear it. Living might be more complicated than dying to me... because living takes a lot of courage. 'Without the courage, you can't handle living. Living is a journey; living is a struggle. People have everything and they still can't do it, they struggle. 'We take ourselves too seriously; we think we're somebody. Who the f***, we're nothing! We come from s***; we think we're special [but] fame is s***. 'You find out you're not [special]. You're capable of going to jail, you're capable of dying, you're capable of being mistreated. 'I don't really expect bad things to happen to me, but when they do happen to me, I understand it and I'm able to handle it. I've handled bad stuff before, that's been my life.I don't trip over bad things, I know s*** happens. When bad things happen, I will be still striving to do something. I won't be discouraged.'"
117,Europeans took SIX TIMES as much MDMA in 2019 as they did in 2011 after scientists measures traces or the drug in five big cities' wastewaterÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8122451/MDMA-use-rise-Belgium-Netherlands-Germany-according-analysis-wastewater.html,"Europeans appear to be developing an MDMA habit according to a new study that analyzed wastewater for drug metabolites and biomarkers. The study, conducted bythe European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), found thatthere was six times more MDMA residue in wastewater samples collected in 2019 compared to 2011. The samples came from five cities the EMCDDA had taken samples from since beginning its wastewater analysis project in 2011, includingBarcelona, Castellon, Milan, Oslo, and Zagreb. The findings were part of a larger report from the EMCDDA on the presence of urinary biomarkers and urinary metabolites in wastewater across Europe. In all, the team tested wastewater samples from 68 European cities in 23 countries, looking for urinary biomarkers or urinary metabolites for cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, amphetamine, and methamphetamine found in European wastewater. The team found that the countries with the highest levels of drug use were mostly in western Europe, according to areporton the study in Newsweek. The countries with the overall highest concentration of urinary biomarkers for MDMA were Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Cocaine use appeared to be highest in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain. The team also looked at methamphetamine use in seven cities for which they had data from 2011 to 2019, including Oslo, Antwerp, Santiago, Paris, Milan, Zagreb, and Castellon. They found that meth use appeared to be declining slightly, dropping from 45mg per 1,000 residents per day in 2011 to 35mg per 1,000 residents per day in 2019. Predictably, concentrations of the drug biomarkers tended to surge on weekends and drop again on weekdays across Europe. usage surged on weekends and dropped significantly on weekdays. The EMCDDA believe their data could be a useful tool for better understanding drug use across Europe. 'By delivering almost real-time data on drug use patterns, both geographically and over time, this novel approach can offer a valuable snapshot of drug use in key cities in Europe and an insight into emerging changes in behavior,' EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said in a statement. 'It is also showing promise in new areas, such as identifying, and estimating the use of, new psychoactive substances and assessing the outcome of interventions targeting drug supply.' 'As a method, wastewater analysis has moved from being an experimental technique to being an important addition in our epidemiological toolkit.' Ecstasy, known chemically as MDMA or molly, has been used by clubbers for decades due to its effects in helping keep people awake. It can come in the form of various pills and often takes about 30 minutes for its long-lasting effects to kick in, which can include feelings of love. In the UK, possession of any form of ecstasy - considered a Class A drug - comes with a potential jail term of up to seven years. In the US, the jail term can be as severe as 40 years in some states. Drug campaigners warn the biggest of taking MDMA revolves around the fact that many users are unaware of what is in the substance they are taking. It can include other drugs, such as PMA, which can be fatal in lower doses than MDMA itself. The Office for National Statistics recorded an eight fold increase in ecstasy deaths last year compared to 5 years ago. The statistics showed that 63 people died from taking MDMA in 2016 - significantly higher than that of the record low in 2010 of eight deaths. "
118,"Bodybuilder, 24, who is dating a man 23 YEARS older than her reveals her brother threatened to KILL her boyfriend when he found out about the age gap romance",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8126429/Woman-dating-man-23-years-older-says-brother-wanted-kill-boyfriend.html,"A female bodybuilder who is dating a man 23 years her senior has revealed that her brother threatened to kill her older boyfriend when he found out about their unconventional relationship. Personal trainer and nutrition coach, Anna Kenyon, 24, who lives in Indianapolis, Indiana, met her partner of four years, business owner, Andy Dittmaire, 47, when she was working as a waitress and studying at university and, at first, she kept her relationship a secret from her family. When her family members first found out, their reaction was awful, with Anna recalling that her mother broke down in tears, while her brother flew off the handle into a violent rage - however she insists they have since come around to the idea of the romance. And Anna confesses that she wasn't totally convinced about Andy when they first met while she was working as a waitress in her local breakfast restaurant and studying for a degree in criminal justice. Sparks didn't exactly fly for Anna, who said she wasn't interested at all at first â€“ although Andy was smitten and called it love at first sight. Even their first date was less than perfect. Recalling the dinner, Anna says she was left red-faced when she ordered a huge fried meal, with fries on the side, whereas Andy opted for a simple, healthy salad. Ironically however, Andy says this was the moment he knew she was the one for him despite Anna still having reservations about the match. Anna explains she feared the reaction of her family to the couple's 23-year age gap and did not reveal she had met someone straight away. And when she eventually did feel the time was right to share her secret, her family didn't react the way she hoped they would. Her mother burst into tears upon hearing the news, while her sister questioned Andy's intentions, asking if he was planning to 'chop her up into little pieces'. Her brother even threatened to kill Anna's new partner, repeatedly shouting 'I'll kill him!' â€“ all before meeting him. Thankfully, it didn't take long, though, for Anna's family to come around to Anna and Andy's relationship once they'd met, and Anna describes them coming to love Andy as much as she does. The couple now even go on holiday with the personal trainer's family. Andy's daughters, Ciara, 27, and Cheyenne, 22, on the other hand, were accepting of Anna from the start despite his eldest daughter being two years older than her dad's girlfriend. The blip in their relationship in its early stages wasn't the only obstacle for the couple to overcome in their four-year partnership, though, as another rough patch arrived when Anna expressed her desire to take up bodybuilding professionally. Anna describes feeling broken by the 47-year-old's reaction to her dream, who expressed concerns her body would change too much and she would become 'repulsive' to him. The 24-year-old, not wanting to sacrifice what she wanted, continued and threw herself into training â€“ leading the couple to split for sixth months after Anna's first show. Couple's counseling was the savior of their relationship and now Andy is supportive of Anna's passion for bodybuilding. Anna, now, attributes their four-year relationship's success to the hard times her and Andy faced. 'At first I did keep him a secret from my family. I was terrified of how'd they react once they found out about the age gap,' Anna said. 'My mom actually started to cry when I first told her, my sister asked if he was going to chop me up into little pieces, and my brother just kept screaming, ""I swear, sis, I'll kill him!"" 'He has two daughters who are pretty close to my age; we are only two years apart. His eldest is 27 and his youngest is 22 but they actually had no issues with our age gap. 'But after the first meeting they knew Andy was genuine and all fell in love with him as much as I did. We all even go on family holidays now which is amazing. However, winning Anna's family over was not the only obstacle that the couple had to overcome. 'Our biggest problem by far was when I decided to become a bodybuilder,' Anna says.'I very specifically remember Andy saying, ""Well I guess you're going to look repulsive."" That honestly broke me, but I kept pushing. After that, we broke up for some time. 'Fortunately, we chose to take on some couple's counseling and were able to sort everything out. Now Andy is very supportive of what I do, and I am so thankful for that. Although that time in our relationship was hard, I believe it needed to happen so we can really value the relationship we have now.' Anna has since competed in the NPC Hoosier flex contest and Indiana Muscle. She had plans to compete again this year but all three shows she's been preparing hard for have been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. Anna's family weren't the only source of negativity for the couple who've also had to face 'gold digger' comments from the outside world. The personal trainer puts the trolling down to people not knowing the real 'them' and judging a book by its cover. 'From the outside looking in, it looks quite odd,' she said. 'Especially since I'm a young personal trainer and Andy is an older businessman. We kind of fit all of the stereotypes. 'Every now and then I'll get the 'she's a gold digger' comment but I know that once people sit and talk to us for ten seconds, they can see our relationship is genuine, true and full of so much love. At the end of the day love is love.' This year will be the last for the bodybuilding competitions as Anna is hanging up her bikini and retiring the spray tans in order to start a family with her older beau after getting married â€“ despite originally not wanting children at all. 'We have so many big plans,' said Anna. 'We aren't too sure if we will just up and elope one day or have a big wedding. We definitely want children and after I finish competing in 2020, we are going to actively try for a family. 'What's funny though is I didn't want children at all, but he did. He was fine with my decision but had hopes that one day I would change my mind. I remember sitting him down and telling him I wanted a family and he was quite shocked but very happy.'"
119,"Never grapple with the duvet cover again! Creators of new product featuring three ZIPS claim it will put an end to climbing inside, shaking and fiddling with buttons",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8123267/Duvet-cover-makes-changing-sheets-easier-before.html,"While household chores are dreaded by many, changing a duvet cover has got to be top of the poll. But thanks toBen King, 30, from London, and Luke Gray, 30, who lives in Chicago, getting ourselves tangled inside the sheets could soon be a thing of the past - as they have designed the first duvet cover to make changing the bed easier. The Koa cover, which starts from Â£69 and is set to launch in around a week, has aunique three zipper opening, with one central zipper on the top and two along the bottom. 'This design allows you to fold the cover open for a simple, three step change,' explained Ben.'You lay the open cover on the bed, drop the duvet on to the cover and tuck in the corners and then zip closed.' He added: 'It is so quick and simple with no heavy shaking, climbing inside or fiddly buttons.' The innovative ideawas inspired by Luke's grandma, who could no longer change the duvet cover because she found it too difficult. 'Luke's gran was the kick for us to make the Koa duvet cover,' explained Ben. 'She was having to wait for her daughter to visit, or ask her neighbours to help make the bed.' 'We have had so many people in similar situations reach out to us, which has made the project really rewarding.' Koa, which will be sold on www.madebykoa.com, was set up by the duo just over 18 months ago to create inventive solutions to overlooked everyday problems. 'Climbing into fresh, soft sheets is one of the best feelings - 77% of people in our survey said they sleep better on fresh sheets - but changing the bed is one of the most hated chores,' explained Luke. 1. You lay the open cover on the bed 2. You drop the duvet onto the cover and tuck in the corners (all within an arm's reach) 3. Then you zip closed 'We're on a mission to take the hassle out of changing the bed and make fresh sheets more delightful.' Ben went on to explain how the invention process was about making up loads of ideas and testing them on friends. 'I turned up to my friends 30th Birthday with one prototype and we had everyone making the bed,' he joked. 'We prototype loads of ideas, prototypes always inspire new ideas.' 'We made most of the prototypes on a sewing machine in our lounge to start with and then started working with a local garment factory as we got closer.' 'The final design has been made with our factories in Portugal, and between me and Luke we have slept in it for over a 1,000 nights.' Ben and Luke have tested and designed over 30 prototypes to ensure the cover isn't just easy to change, but also soft and comfy. 'We've tested, slept in and redesigned the duvet cover to create the perfect easy-change solution,' explained Ben. 'Even Luke's grandma was able to change the bed for the first time in years.' For the launch, Koa have partnered with British fabric designer Kitty McCall to create two exclusive and joyful patterns, landscape and fragment, which feature alongside Koa's essential colours, white and slate. The Koa cover will come in a range of sizes, including Double and King (UK/Europe), Full, Queen and King (US), with more sizes to be added."
0,Trump doubles down and calls coronavirus 'the Chinese virus' a second time despite Beijing demanding he 'correct it immediately' in escalating diplomatic feud between the two nationsÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120879/China-blasts-President-Donald-Trump-calling-coronavirus-Chinese-virus.html,"Donald Trump doubled down Tuesday afterChinalashed out at Washington for him calling the novel coronavirus 'the Chinese Virus'. President Trump tweeted Monday: 'The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!' Early Tuesday Beijing demanded 'the U.S. side correct the mistake immediately and halt its groundless accusations' But Trump then doubled down tweeting Tuesday morning about New York's governor Andrew Cuomo - who has demanded the military are activated to build hospitals - that: 'Cuomo wants ""all states to be treated the same."" 'But all states arenâ€™t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all.' The tweet-for-tat came the day after Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, called China to accuse it of spreading conspiracy theories that the virus was the creation of the U.S. military. Contrasting conspiracy theories, that it was created by China as a tool for biological warfare, have been aired in pro-Trump circles in the U.S. And Pompeo himself has called it the Wuhan virus in a series of media appearances, as have fervently pro-Trump Republicans including Tom Cotton, the Oklahoma senator, and Paul Gosar, an Arizona congressman who then had to go into self-quarantine over fears he was infected with it. Geng Shuang, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accused 'certain American politicians' of promoting stigmatisation by connecting the novel coronavirus with China. He did not name President Trump specifically, but was referring to President Trump's tweet, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua. 'We express strong indignation and resolute opposition to this,' Mr Geng said at a daily news briefing. The spokesperson stressed that the coronavirus outbreak had occurred in multiple places around the world and the urgent task was for the international community to join forces to curb the pandemic. 'The United States should mind its own business first, and then make constructive contributions to the international counter-epidemic collaboration and the maintenance of the global public health safety,' Mr Geng continued. Anti-US sentiment is also growing in China as people on the country's Twitter-like Weibo has shown an outpouring of anger towards President Trump. One person said: 'Trump is the virus of the world'. Another typical comment accused: 'American virus!' A petition urging President Trump to apologize over his comment has appeared on the White House's website. The post read: 'President Trump owes all Chinese apologies for naming COVID19 ""the Chinese Virus"" in his latest twitter, especially under the circumstances where the origin of COVID-19 is not scientifically definite yet. Not only is his twitter defiance against science, but also cause hostages among Chinese and the other races.' The request would need 100,000 signatures to secure a response from the White House. As of writing, 25,716 people have signed. On MondayPompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels 'to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,' the State Department said. Pompeo 'stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,' the department added. The State Department on Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in tweets last week in both Mandarin and English, suggested that 'patient zero' in the global pandemic may have come from the United States -- not the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. 'It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,' tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media. Scientists suspect that the virus first came to humans at a meat market in Wuhan that butchered exotic animals. Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to SARS-CoV-2 as the 'Wuhan virus' despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing. Yang issued a 'stern warning to the United States that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail,' the official Xinhua news agency said in its summary of the call with Pompeo. The key Chinese foreign policy leader 'noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people,' Xinhua said. 'He urged the US side to immediately correct its wrongful behavior and stop making groundless accusations against China.' President Donald Trump, under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his allies have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners. Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally, has spoken of the 'Chinese coronavirus' and in a recent statement vowed, 'we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.' While COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the virus - has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.   The news comes as China tries to deflect blame for the contagion and reframe itself as a country that took decisive steps to buy the world time by placing huge swathes of its population under quarantine. State-run newspaper China Daily today urged the rest of the world to learn from China and follow the principles of early detection, early quarantine and early treatment to halt the global spread of the coronavirus. China reported only one new domestic infection today compared to a daily toll of 15,152 five weeks ago. It also comes after China and the United States blamed each other as the alleged origin of the killer infection. A Beijing spokesperson last week claimed that the coronavirus might have been brought to Wuhan by the US military while US politicians called it the 'Wuhan virus' or 'Chinese coronavirus'. With cases falling in China and soaring abroad, Beijing is now rejecting the widely held assessment that the city of Wuhan is the birthplace of the outbreak. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian went a step further on Thursday, saying on Twitter that 'it might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan' - without providing any evidence. He doubled down on his claim on Friday by posting a link to an article from a website known for publishing conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks. Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said he believed Zhao was 'tweeting in his official capacity'. China's intention in promoting the conspiracy theory is 'to divert from domestic discontent' over the handling of the outbreak, which has killed more than 3,200 people in the country. Asked if Mr Zhao was representing the government's view, fellow foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Friday that 'the international community, including (people) in the United States, have different views on the source of the virus'. 'China from the beginning thinks this is a scientific issue, and that we need to listen to scientific and professional advice,' Geng said. The United States, meanwhile, has angered China by using language directly linking the virus to the country. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to it as the 'Wuhan virus', prompting Beijing to reject the term as 'despicable' and 'disrespecting science'. While Kevin McCarthy, a US congressman, called the virus the 'Chinese coronavirus' on Twitter. In a tweet on Monday, he wrote: 'Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus can be found on one, regularly-updated website.' He was sharing the link to the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The push to question the origin of the disease contradicts China's own initial assessment about the source of the virus, which has now killed more than 7,000 people worldwide. Gao Fu, head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January 'we now know the source of the virus is wild animals sold at the seafood market' in Wuhan. Chinese authorities themselves saw Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province as a threat as they placed the region of 56 million people under strict quarantine to contain the epidemic. But Beijing began sowing doubts in late February, when Zhong Nanshan, a respected expert affiliated with the National Health Commission, told reporters 'the epidemic first appeared in China, but didn't necessarily originate in China'. Scientists, however, have long suspected that the virus jumped from an animal at the Wuhan market to a human before spreading globally. The World Health Organization has said that while the exact path the virus took between its animal source and humans is still unclear, COVID-19 was 'unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019'. Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology at Imperial College London, said genetic analysis of coronavirus samples collected from around the world showed a common ancestor in China. 'This is not in any way blaming a particular country,' she told AFP."
1,Donate your N95 mask to your hospital: Pence pleads with construction firms as crisis over personal protection equipment deepens and Trump reveals plans for Army M.A.S.H. hospitals to deal with victims,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8122221/Mike-Pence-pleads-construction-firms-hand-N95-masks-hospitals.html,"Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday urged construction firms to donate specialized N95 masks to their local hospitals as the government tries to head off a rush of demand for equipment to protect doctors and nurses from the coronavirus outbreak. Pence made the plea at a televised press conference along with President Trump and top government health officials, amid a nationwide shortage of equipment. Trump said he has started the process of having the U.S. Army Corps of engineers construct field hospitals to boost the volume of hospitals beds. 'We are starting the process,' he said. He said they would be M.A.S.H. hospitals, orUnited States Army Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. 'They do call them M.A.S.H. hospitals,' Trump said. 'Weâ€™re looking at different sites in a few different locations.' New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made a request for assistance, which Trump said would be provided. State and local governments are preparing for an onslaught of hospital patients as the coronavirus outbreak spreads â€“ with the national stockpile also not up to the anticipated demand. 'We would urge construction companies to donate their N95 masks to your local hospital and for go additional order of those industrial masks,' Pence said. 'Those industrial masks are perfectly acceptable for healthcare workers to be protected from a respiratory disease,' Pence said. He pointed to the industry, which he said Trump knows well' from his real estate background. He also asked construction firms to forego additional orders of the specialized masks, which can both protect medical professionals and keep infected patients from spreading the virus. Pence's appeal came as federal officials have told doctors and health workers the nation's stockpile doesn't have enough basic medical equipment like masks and gowns to meet the expected crush ofcoronavirus cases. The stark assessment, conveyed in a conference call Monday, comes as the Health Department has begun distributing supplies a national stockpile created for such health emergencies. But the administration is acknowledging the supply is 'finite' and sending the equipment out to priority areas and based on a population formula. With a looming shortage of beds that public officials fear could fall well short of demand in an outbreak, the White House is even considering the use of hospital ships,White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx said. The problem: the Navy only has two of them, and they can't get inland. 'The president is considering all of the options. We're looking at hospital beds, ICU beds, informed by the data from Seattle and Santa Clara, and I just really want to thank the governors and the health commissioners from those states who are providing us the on-the-ground daily reports of hospital utilizations,' Birx told Fox News. 'There are multiple options in our reserve, including the V.A. Hospitals, Department of Defense medical treatment facilities and even hospital ships. There are a lot of things to consider and all of those things are on the table right now,' she said. In New York state, 19 per cent of positive coronavirus cases are being hospitalized, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a televised briefing from Albany, in a state where cases continue to spike. Adding to the need are infections that have been identified among medical professionals serving on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak. 'It is essential that the federal govt works with this state and that this state works with the federal government. We cannot do this on our own,' he said. On Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar refused to say how many ventilators the government had and now many were projected to be needed, calling it a 'national security issue.' The following day, the administration announced recommendations that Americans not gather in groups of more than ten people and stick to their homes. HHS officials communicated the information to medical professionals in a conference call Monday, CNNreported, and said the nation's stockpile was insufficient to meet needs. The representatives from the office of theAssistant Secretary for Preparedness Reponses said the government had not yet identified a solution. Congress is trying to deal with the problem with new purchases, but it is not yet clear how quickly it will be possible to get equipment online. According to a statement released by HHS Tuesday, 'Because of the finite supply of PPE in the commercial supply chain, delivery of products from the SNS is prioritized based on need.' Equipment goes out to all 50 states, 8 territories, plus urban areas including Chicago, Los Angeles County, New York City, and Washington, D.C. 'The distribution is based on a pro-rata formula that is proportionate to the population size of each jurisdiction based on 2010 U.S. Census data. For areas facing high transmission rates, additional allocations are available,' according to the agency. "

An alert has been issued for anyone who played at the Colorado Bridge Center in El Paso County between February 27 and March 3 - but especially in a tournament on February 29 and March 1 - to contact officials over fears they might be infected. At least one person who attended the center has already tested positive for the virus, while two more have been hospitalized with symptoms. John Dukellis, a director of the center who is self-isolating over fears he may have the illness, said at least 284 people - 98 per cent of whom are over the age of 60 - attended the tournmanet and are now at risk. 'This group is going to be hard hit,' Dukellis told The Denver Post. 'This is just the beginning.' It is thought the woman had some symptoms at the time she attended the tournament, but not ones that she was concerned about. Colorado had 160 confirmed cases of coronavirus by midnight Monday, with one confirmed death - the bridge player, who was aged in her 80s. While most of the players were from Colorado Springs, Dukellis said the tournament attracted players from all over the state - including Denver. At least some of the at-risk players came to the tournament from care homes which are now also at risk of outbreaks. El Paso County Public Health said it is in touch with affected homes, but would not say how many homes are at risk or where they are located. It comes after an outbreak in the Life Care Center of Kirkland, in Washington state, killed at least 27 people - accounting for the majority of the state's 48 deaths from the virus. Elderly people and those with unerlying health conditions are most at risk from dying of the disease, which causes respiratory issues Multiple states began shutting down their bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms on Monday as cities like New York and San Francisco turned into ghost towns after officials took strident steps to slow the spread of coronavirus. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he had been waiting for orders from the White House, but decided to take matters into his own hands Monday after a lack of action from Washington. While ordering many businesses into a virtual shut-down, he attacked Trump's slow-footed response - saying that federal action is needed to tackle a country-wide crisis. 'This government has to get more engaged. There's been no country that hasn't handled this on a federalized level,' Cuomo said. 'This patchwork quilt of policies doesn't work. It makes no sense for me to do something in New York and New Jersey to do something else.' There are now 4,661 confirmed cases across the US with one in virtually every state, while 86 people have died from the virus. However, there are fears that the true number of cases is much higher after delays in testing potential patients across the nation. The World Health Organisation has urged affected countries to 'test, test, test' saying it is impossible to fight the virus blindfolded. Other cities have implemented their own shutdowns but the federal government has yet to take a position on it. Trump told Americans to 'settle down' on Sunday and warned them to stop stockpiling supplies, saying food stores would remain open no matter what happened. However he is being widely criticized for his approach to the pandemic, which many say has been too slow from the beginning."
3,How the world's major cities are responding to coronavirus: The measures that nine urban centers are taking - and not taking - to contain the pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121079/How-worlds-major-cities-responding-coronavirus.html,"The world's major cities have adopted a bewildering array of measures to fend off the coronavirus crisis, with some enforcing drastic lockdowns while others prefer a lighter touch. Some popular tourist hotspots such as Rome have become nearly deserted after citizens were ordered to stay inside to stop the virus spreading. Limits on public gatherings have been set as low as 50 people in Berlin and New York City, with Donald Trump suggesting a limit of ten for the U.S. as a whole. But schools, bars and restaurants are still open in London, where the UK government has been much more reluctant to impose draconian measures. Some cities such as San Francisco are threatening people with fines or imprisonment if they venture out illegally, while other authorities are still only offering guidance. In some countries such as Italy, the national government has taken command of the crisis and ordered shutdowns across the country. However, U.S. states and cities have more freedom to take their own actions, while Germany has also left much of the decision-making to its 16 states including Berlin. Scroll down to read how nine of the world's major cities -Berlin, London, Paris, Seoul, Rome, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and San Francisco - have reacted to the outbreak. BERLIN Berlin is one of Germany's 16 states, which have considerable autonomy in choosing how to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Berlin authorities decided to shut down schools and kindergartens last Friday, taking effect from this week. School exams can still take place if pupils are kept at a distance of 5ft (1.5m) apart in order to avoid close contact. Bars, pubs and the city's popular nightclubs have been closed. However, restaurants can remain open if they enforce the 5ft safety distance between guests. The measures are due to get tougher tomorrow when shops are ordered to close, except for essential services such as food stores and pharmacies. The new order to shut down less important businesses such as clothes shops was recommended by the federal government yesterday. There is a complete ban on sports at public and private facilities in Berlin, including swimming pools and fitness studios. Bundesliga football has already been shut down across the country, keeping fans away from the Olympic Stadium where Hertha BSC Berlin play their matches. There are restrictions on visits to hospitals and care homes, but there is no general ban on travel and Berlin's public transport system is still running. Berlin has confirmed 300 virus cases, with no deaths. ROME The Italian government's unprecedented lockdown was extended to the whole country last week after it was initially confined to the north. That means schools, bars and restaurants have been shut down across the country by decree of prime minister Giuseppe Conte, including in the capital. Shops are also closed except for food stores and pharmacies. There is a total ban on public gatherings of any size, and sports have been completely shut down with people ordered to stay indoors. Movement is heavily restricted, with the few remaining travellers required to fill out forms and provide a valid reason such as work or medical treatment. Popular tourist landmarks such as the Spanish Steps and the Colosseum, which are usually overflowing with tourists, have been left deserted by the lockdown. The Vatican, which is technically separate from Rome, has imposed its own measures although the Pope appears to have overruled a plan to shut all the city's churches. The province of Rome has 412 virus cases. Italian government figures do not state how many have died, but there have been 19 deaths in the wider Lazio region. SEOUL South Korea has experienced one of the world's worst outbreaks, but has not imposed the same drastic measures seen in many European countries, focusing on mass testing instead. In any case, Seoul has not been at the centre of the crisis. The outbreak originated in the southern city of Daegu and was linked to a secretive cult which is based there. As a result, bars and restaurants have not been closed in Seoul and there is no general ban on travel. Public health director Yoon Tae-ho has urged South Koreans across the country to avoid public gatherings, but there is no specified limit. Still, some alarm has been raised in Seoul after a batch of new cases were linked to a call centre in the city, operated by an insurance company. The start of the new school semester was postponed until March 23 with officials providing digital textbooks and online classes. Sports have also been shut down, including football's K-League which was due to kick off on February 29 but has yet to get started. FC Seoul is the city's only representative in the league. Seoul has confirmed 253 virus cases, but has not yet reported a death, according to Korean government figures. Fifty-five people have been discharged. PARIS French president Emmanuel Macron announced a sweeping national lockdown last week including a total closure of schools and universities across the country. Restaurants and bars have been shut down, including in Paris, and people ordered to stay at home except to buy groceries, travel to work if necessary or receive medical care - which also rules out sports. On Sunday, the government announced that long-distance travel, including trains and international flights will be limited and domestic public transport reduced. Gatherings are not allowed at all, even among friends and family. Popular Paris tourist sites such as Disneyland, the Louvre art gallery and the Eiffel Tower have been closed. Shops have also been closed across France, although supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, petrol stations and tobacco shops - which also sell newspapers, snacks and stamps - remain open. Official statistics do not provide a figure for Paris specifically. However, the wider Ile-de-France region has 1,762 cases and four deaths. LONDON Britain has taken a lighter touch than most European countries, although Boris Johnson's government has ramped up containment measures in recent days. Schools remain open, amid concerns that the National Health Service would be short of staff if doctors and nurses had to look after their children at home. King's College London is among the universities which say they will 'transition into more flexible working' with fewer face-to-face teaching sessions. Authorities are not enforcing any ban on movements in London, although Mr Johnson yesterday pleaded with Britons to 'stop all unnecessary travel'. The London Underground is still running. Similarly, Mr Johnson said yesterday it was 'time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others' but no specific limit on gatherings has been introduced while bars and restaurants have not been ordered to close. Professional sport has been stopped, including football's Premier League, affecting five London teams - Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, West Ham and Crystal Palace. However, some amateur running events are still going ahead. There have been 480 virus cases in London, and 15 deaths. LOS ANGELES The Los Angeles Unified School District announced on Friday it was shutting down schools from Monday, saying it hoped to provide 'learning opportunities' remotely. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti yesterday ordered all bars and nightclubs that do not serve food to shut down over virus fears. Restaurant meals are banned, although staff may still prepare food for delivery or takeout. There is no general ban on travelling, although county officials say people should 'avoid non-essential travel'. California governor Gavin Newsom has imposed a statewide ban on gatherings of 250 people or more, with smaller events required to enforce a 6ft safety distance. President Donald Trump yesterday went much further in his advice to the nation and said that gatherings of as few as 10 people should be avoided. All major sports have already been shut down in America, after the NHL, MLS, MLB and NBA all suspended their seasons. The NFL is currently in the off-season. Gyms, fitness centres and bowling alleys have also been shut down in Los Angeles, while grocery stores and cafeterias in medical facilities can remain open. Los Angeles county - which is larger than the city limits - has 94 virus cases with one death. NEW YORK CITY Starting on Monday, all public school buildings in New York City have been shut until spring recess, which does not end until April 20. All outdoor and indoor events with 50 or more people have been banned by city authorities. Gatherings with 49 people or fewer are advised to fill up less than half of their venue, in order to encourage 'social distancing' between guests. Restaurants, bars and cafes may only serve food for takeout and delivery, while nightclubs have been closed. Official advice says that 'all New Yorkers - healthy or sick - need to stay home.' 'You should only leave your home for essential tasks, such as work (if you cannot work from home), getting groceries and supplies or essential medical care,' officials say. There have been 463 confirmed cases in New York City, and seven deaths. SAN FRANCISCO Like Los Angeles, San Francisco is subject to the California ban on public gatherings of 250 people or more. However, the city went further in a 'shelter in place' order which came into effect yesterday and says that gatherings outside the home are 'generally prohibited'.  San Francisco has also prohibited any travel on 'foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit' unless essential. The decree warns that 'violation of or failure to comply with this Order is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both' - striking the toughest tone in the country so far. Shops and businesses that are not deemed 'essential' will have to close, although that definition stretches beyond food and medication to banks, dry cleaners and car repair shops. All schools in the San Francisco Unified School District have been closed until at least April 3. All bars and restaurants are also closed, although restaurants can continue to provide delivery and takeaway services. Gyms and recreation facilities have also been closed. San Francisco has 40 confirmed cases, with no deaths. CHICAGO Chicago's public schools are closed from today until at least the end of the month over coronavirus fears. Universities and childcare facilities have not been ordered to close, although some are doing so voluntarily. Illinois' Democratic governorJB Pritzker has already shut down bars and restaurants across the whole state, including Chicago. The state of Illinois has also ordered a ban on public gatherings of 50 people or more, a tighter limit than California but not as strict as Trump's recommendation of ten.  Chicago restaurants will still be allowed to offer delivery and drive-thru services. There is no general warning to stay at home. Only older people and those with chronic conditions are advised to avoid any kind of travel. Equally, employers are only encouraged to send their workers home when they are feeling sick. Chicago has confirmed 49 virus cases, with no deaths."
4,"Dow rallies 1,000 points after Wall Street had its worst day since 1987's Black Monday and Trump said US is 'maybe' heading for recession",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121489/Stocks-set-small-rebound-Wall-Streets-worst-day-Black-Monday.html,"U.S. stock indexes rallied on Tuesday, following Wall Street's steepest fall since 1987 in the previous session, as drastic efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed supply chains and crushed business sentiment. At 12.11pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up1,075.63 points, or5.33 percent, to21,264.15. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 were both up more than 5 percent at noon. Stocks rallied as President Donald Trump and the White House coronavirus team addressed the nation, outlining a stimulus plan that included payments to small businesses, loan guarantees to industries such as airlines and hotels, and assistance for workers. The Dow dipped into negative territory in the first half hour of trading, however, briefly dropping below 20,000 points for the first time since February 2017. Monday's 12 percent drop for the S&P 500, its worst day in more than three decades, came as voices from Wall Street to the White House said the coronavirus may be dragging the economy into a recession. The S&P 500 has shed nearly 30 percent since setting a record less than a month ago, and its at its lowest point since the end of 2018. Monday's precipitous losses accelerated in the last half hour of trading, after President Donald Trump said the economy could be headed for a recession and asked Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. Asked if a recession was on the cards at a press conference on Monday, Trump said:'Maybe. We're not thinking in terms of recession, we're thinking it terms of the virus.' The Trump administration is proposing a roughly $850 billion stimulus plan to help the economy, including relief for small businesses and the airline industry, as well as a tax cut for wage-earners, sources told the AP. The travel industry has been among the industries hardest hit by the outbreak, as planes sit grounded and hotels and casinos shut their doors. Monday's plunge came even though the Federal Reserve rushed to announce a new round of emergency actions before markets opened for trading on Monday. The moves are aimed at propping up the economy and getting financial markets running smoothly again, but they may have raised fears even further. Investors are also waiting for the White House and Congress to offer more aid to an economy that's increasingly shutting down by the hour. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,997 points, or 12.9%. Declines last week ended the longest-ever bull market on Wall Street, nearly 11 years following the financial crisis. There's seemingly no escape from the uncertainty: From parked airplanes to empty restaurants, nobody knows when economies might revive or even when countries will be able to get the spread of the virus under control. Closing businesses can help slow the spread of the virus, but it also takes cash out of the pockets of companies and workers. The best-case scenario for many investors is that the economic shock will be steep but short, with growth recovering later this year after businesses reopen. Pessimists are preparing for a longer haul. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. But severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems, and the virus appears to have a much higher mortality rate than the typical flu in those groups. The Federal Reserve has been trying to do what it can to help the economy, and over the weekend it slashed short-term interest rates back to their record low of nearly zero. It also said it also will buy at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities to help calm the Treasury market, which is a bedrock for the worldÂ´s financial system and influences stock and bond prices around the world. Trading in the market was starting to snarl last week, with traders spotting disconcertingly large gaps in prices offered by buyers and sellers. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.81% from 0.73% late Monday. In currency trading, the dollar rose to 107.08 Japanese yen from 105.90 yen. The euro weakened to $1.1011 from $1.1184. Regulators prepare to help traders work remotely as trillions in trading shifts from high-tech exchanges to makeshift home offices Federal regulator are preparing to make it easier for traders to work from home, as the financial system girds itself for the likelihood that trillions in trading volume will shift from exchanges to home offices. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is planning to allow market participants to skip certain record-keeping requirements if they work from home over coronavirus fears, theWall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing officials familiar with the matter. The relief from the regulator is short-term and will apply to trading venues, banks, brokers and other parties until June 30, according to the report. The first set of no-action letters - where regulators inform market participants that they won't enforce certain rules - is expected to come Tuesday, the report said.  The measures to be announced include extending certain filing deadlines and allowing manual record-keeping as traders will not have access to phone lines that can tape calls, a regulatory requirement under normal circumstances, the report added. The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Coronavirus crisis hit retail sales last month, new data shows The coronavirus took a bite out of US retail sales in February, government data released Tuesday showed, with almost all sectors falling and fuel sales leading the decline. Retail sales in February declined 0.5 percent to $528.1 billion, seasonally adjusted, a worse-than-expected result and a sharp decline that erased most of the gain seen in January. The data are the latest in the growing body of evidence of the virus' economic toll, but the survey was taken before the outbreak spread across the United States and put entire cities on lockdown, which has led many economists to conclude the US is likely heading into recession. While sales were still a 4.3 percent above February 2019, Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics said that number was distorted because spending pulled back in early 2019 due to the extended federal government shut down. 'Disruptions from the coronavirus will bring the economy's main engine to a halt,' he wrote in an analysis. 'As the virus keeps consumers at home and panic spreads, discretionary spending and 'social consumption' will take a significant hit.' Gas stations led the fall in sales with a 2.8 percent drop compared to January as oil prices began declining at the end of February, amid reduced global demand due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, which has now spread worldwide. US sales of building materials and electronics also saw declines of about one-and-a-half percent. Food and beverage sales were flat, perhaps thanks to stockpiling and panic buying as the virus loomed in the public conscience, while sporting goods, music and book stores registered a slight increase. Nonstore retailers, such as e-commerce websites, posted a gain of 0.7 percent. Data will almost certainly get worse before it gets better, Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said. 'The data indicate net slowing in total real spending,' she wrote in a note, adding she expects total consumer spending to register a decline of 1.5 percent in the second quarter."
5,"Trump takes aim at governors in wake of coronavirus outbreak, claiming New York's Cuomo should 'keep politics out of it' and Michigan governor on shortlist for Joe Biden's VP has to 'work harder'Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121393/Donald-Trump-goes-hitting-Andrew-Cuomo-calling-coronavirus-Chinese-virus.html,"Donald Trump lashed out at Andrew Cuomo Tuesday, demanding the New York governor â€˜keep politics out ofâ€™ the government response to the coronavirus crisis. 'Cuomo wants 'all states to be treated the same.' But all states aren't the same,' the president insisted Tuesday morning. 'Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big 'hotspot', West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases.' 'Andrew, keep politics out of itâ€¦.' Trump continued. He also took aim at Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer â€“ a name that has been floated as a running mate for former Vice President Joe Biden â€“ claiming she hasn't had an adequate response to the outbreak. 'Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive,' Trump tweeted. 'We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!' Whitmer endorsed Biden for president earlier this month and has made the short list of those he is considering running with should he earn the Partyâ€™s nomination. Trump claimed he is working well with the states and their governors as coronavirus continues to rock the nation, and predicted that 'good things will happen.' 'Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials,' he posted in another tweet Tuesday morning. 'Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS' The president referred to coronavirus in one of his tweets as the 'Chinese Virus,' which many have claimed over the past month is racist â€“ but the term came about because the virus originated in Wuhan, China. Trump's attack came a day after he spoke with U.S. governors to discuss the federal government response to help states deal with the increasing cases. He specifically called out Cuomo after the governor published a New York Times op/ed over the weekend demanding Trump mobilize the military. The president insisted during a press conference at the White House Monday afternoon that while the federal government is ordering massive amounts of medical supplies, he is encouraging governors to acquire ventilators and respirators for their own states. 'If they can get them faster by getting them on their own â€“ in other words go through a supply chain that they may have. Because the governors â€“ you know, during normal times â€“ the governor's buy a lot of things, not necessarily through federal government,' Trump said. 'If they're able to get ventilators, respirators â€“ if they're able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government,' he continued. The president said that the federal government is 'stockpiling' necessary medical supplies, but he feels it may be more efficient if governors help acquire more. 'If they can get them directly, it's always going to be faster if they can get them directly â€“ if they need them. And I've given them authorization to order directly,' the president said. Trump held a video conference call with the nation's governors earlier in the day Monday where he told them not to rely on federal government for supplies because there might not be enough. He also said governors should do more to respond to the growing coronavirus crisis, including acquiring their own medical equipment for their respective states. 'Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment â€” try getting it yourselves,' Trump told U.S. governors during the conference call, according to a recording acquired by The New York Times. 'We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves,' he continued. 'Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.' Following the call, Trump took a hit at Cuomo, claiming he has to 'do more' for the state with the most cases of coronavirus. 'Just had a very good tele-conference with Nation's Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to 'do more,'' he tweeted, having to repost after making a spelling mistake in the first iteration. Cuomo lashed out at Trump: 'I have to do more?' 'No â€” YOU have to do something! You're supposed to be the President,' the governor fired back on Twitter. 'Happy to do your job, too,' he posted in another tweet. 'Just give me control of the Army Corps of Engineers and I'll take it from there,' Cuomo continued. Trump was asked at the press conference Monday if he was going to use the Corps of Engineers or FEMA to build surge capacity areas at hospitals. 'So first of all, we hope we don't get there,' Trump said of using those resources. 'And that's what we're doing and that's why we're taking a very strict look at this.' He also claimed that the federal government is already working on expanding and taking over unused buildings as flex space as more are diagnosed with coronavirus. 'We hope we don't have to get there. But we are doing a lot in that regard,' he added. Trump also used the phrase 'Chinese Virus' in reference to Coronavirus in a tweet Monday night when talking about the U.S. government bolstering hospitality and airline business as it takes a hit in light of the outbreak. 'The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!' Trump tweeted. China lashed out Tuesday in a response to Trump calling the fast-spreading respiratory virus, which has affected every continent â€“ except Antarctica â€“ the 'Chinese Virus.' Beijing demanded 'the U.S. side correct the mistake immediately and halt its groundless accusations.' 'The United States should mind its own business first, and then make constructive contributions to the international counter-epidemic collaboration and the maintenance of the global public health safety,' spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, said. 'We express strong indignation and resolute opposition to this,' Geng said at a daily news briefing. Governors across the U.S. have scrambled in the wake of the coronavirus crisis and have increasingly turned toward the federal government for supplies, personnel and financial aid â€“ including waiting on the economic stimulus package to pass through Congress. The response to Trump from governors during the call Monday was furious. New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham said the president's plan was putting the whole nation at a higher risk. 'If one state doesn't get the resources and materials they need, the entire nation continues to be at risk,' the Democrat governor said on the call. Lujan Grisham added that the response from the White House and Congress was causing states to compete against one another for necessary medical products. On Sunday, New York City shut down public schools until April 20 at the earliest, meaning students in the city will miss at least more than a month of their curriculum. Earlier on in the outbreak, New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City, established a one-mile containment zone earlier this month after dozens of cases were linked to a 50-year-old attorney, who lives there and worked in Manhattan, tested positive for coronavirus. As of last Wednesday, there were 121 cases in Westchester County, New York, which is the biggest cluster in the state and one of the biggest in the U.S. New York State has the most cases of coronavirus of any other state in the U.S. with nearly 1,000 confirmed cases. The Times noted that Trump took an upbeat tone during the conversation Monday, repeating the phrase: 'We're going to get it remedied and hopefully very quickly.' During a press conference Sunday afternoon, Health and Human Service Secretary Alex Azar told DailyMail.com that he couldn't 'disclose concrete numbers on particular items' when asked about providing ventilators and building more hospital beds. He said he couldn't give a direct answer for 'national security purposes.' 'We will work to increase the supplies of personal protective equipment of ventilators of field medical units, hospitals,' Azar continued, keeping it vague. 'We have tremendous supplies,' he added. 'But we want to acquire more.' Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the administration's coronavirus task force, also said on the matter: 'The whole issue of personal protective equipment and supplies and the capacity of our healthcare system is in the forefront of what we're talking about.'"
6,"Coronavirus crisis could last TWO YEARS, with countries forced to keep restrictions in place for the whole duration, Germany warnsÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121253/Coronavirus-crisis-TWO-YEARS-Germany-warns.html,"Germany's public health agency has warned that the coronavirus crisis could last up to two years. The Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency responsible for disease control and prevention, made the claim on Tuesday as it strengthened the threat risk for Germany from 'moderate' to 'high'. It comes after German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday announced gatherings in churches, mosques and synagogues would be banned and said playgrounds and non-essential shops would close as the country reaches 7,000 confirmed cases, and 14 deaths. The Robert Koch Institute said the pandemic could stretch on for another 24 months as they usually run their course in waves. According to RKI President Lothar Wieler, the length of time depends on how many people develop immunity to COVID-19 after contracting the virus, how many more people test positive for the illness and how long it takes to develop a vaccine. Dr Wieler did not rule out the potential for some of the emergency measures established by countries to have to stay in place for that duration. Meanwhile German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the government has come up with some 50 million euros (Â£45 million)to bring home German citizens stuck abroad. He announced a drive to bring home thousands of tourists stranded in popular winter vacation spots across the globe - particularly people on package holidays in Morocco, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, the Maldives and Egypt.  Maas said the government is spending up to 50 million euros on the effort to bring Germans home over the coming days in co-operation with airlines including Lufthansa.  He did not give a precise number of stranded Germans but said there was a particularly large number in Morocco, with around 4,000 or 5,000. He said that 'even if we will do everything humanly possible, we cannot in every case provide a solution within 24 hours'. He said his ministry has issued a formal warning against tourist travel to any country. Germany's Volkswagen said it will close most of its European plants for two weeks due to uncertainty about demand for cars and supplies of parts amid the outbreak. The Berlin city government has agreed to build a new hospital for up to 1,000 coronavirus patients with the help of the military and other partners, German daily Tagesspiegel on Tuesday cited the capital's health minister as saying. As of Monday there were 6,012 people in Germany infected with coronavirus, of which 300 are in Berlin. The newspaper did not give any details of the construction timeframe. Tagesspiegel said that from Monday underground train services in Berlin would be reduced, with trains only running every 10 minutes. "
7,The Queen self-isolates at Windsor Castle: 93-year-old Royal will head to royal residence a week early and remain there until after EasterÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121783/The-Queen-self-isolate-Windsor-Castle-amid-coronavirus-fears.html,"The Queen is to base herself at Windsor Castle early and is likely to stay there beyond the Easter period as she follows Government guidance on coronavirus. Buckingham Palace announced today that the 93-year-old head of state will decamp to the Berkshire royal residence on Thursday - a week earlier than she usually does for Easter Court. The Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace have also been called off and the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party in Edinburgh, which takes place in July, is under review. The monarch will be based at her favourite home with a reduced household and will be following appropriate advice, a source said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on all people in the UK, particularly the over 70s, to avoid all non-essential contact and travel as part of unprecedented peacetime measures aimed at trying to control the spread of Covid-19. Elizabeth II, the nation's longest reigning monarch, is due to celebrate her 94th birthday next month, and the risk of more severe symptoms from the coronavirus is greater for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.  Investitures will be rearranged and the annual Maundy Service at St George's Chapel has been cancelled, the palace said. The Queen's audiences this week at Buckingham Palace will still go ahead as planned including receiving the Prime Minister, the Commanding Officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth and the Bishop of Hereford. But future audiences will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, the palace said. She is not the only royal affected by the Government's new advice.Heir to the throne the Prince of Wales is 71 and the Duchess of Cornwall is 72. Other working royals include the Queen's cousins the Duke of Gloucester, 75, the Duke of Kent, 84, and Princess Alexandra, 83. The Duke of Edinburgh, 98, has already been spending most of his time in the sanctuary of Wood Farm, a cottage on the Sandringham estate. The palace said further announcements would be made on Trooping the Colour, the 75th anniversary of VE Day and a state visit by the Emperor and Empress of Japan, in consultation with the Government. Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masakois are due to stay with the Queen at Windsor Castle in May and be feted with a ceremonial welcome and a grand state banquet, but the high-profile occasion is expected to be postponed. The palace said in a statement: 'As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, a number of changes are being made to the Queen's diary. 'Her Majesty will move to Windsor Castle for the Easter period on Thursday 19 March, one week earlier than planned. It is likely the Queen will stay there beyond the Easter period. 'In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, a number of public events with large numbers of people due to have been attended by the Queen, and other members of the royal family, in the coming months will be cancelled or postponed.' An investiture had been due to take place at the palace on Wednesday. Sixty-one recipients, accompanied by guests, were due to gather in the ballroom to collect a range of accolades, from MBEs to knighthoods and damehoods. The Easter period is expected to be a quiet one for the monarch, as is usual, a source said. Each year, the Queen takes up official residence in Windsor for a month over Easter between March and April, known as Easter Court. The Queen also usually hosts a Dine and Sleep event during her stay when guests are given a bed for the night in the castle, but this will undoubtedly not take place. Famous guests in the past have included director Tim Burton, actress Helena Bonham Carter, Bond star Daniel Craig and actress Rachel Weisz. On Friday, Her Majesty's upcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden were postponed because of the coronaviruspandemic. She is also said to have been advised to cancel her annual garden parties in May and June in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Earlier this month the Queen is reported to have vowed not to let the outbreak stop her from performing her duties and to set an example by 'keeping calm and carrying on' until there is 'compelling advice to the contrary'. On Saturday, abuilding in Windsor Great Park was closed for a deep clean after three people showed symptoms similar to those of Covid-19.The Savill Building was closed over the weekend for the clean to take place. A statement on the park's website said: 'As a precautionary measure we have taken the decision to close The Savill Building over the weekend to conduct a deep clean of the premises, after becoming aware of three individuals, who are showing symptoms similar to those of Covid-19, having been on site. 'Whilst these are not confirmed cases we feel that this is a prudent step that prioritises the health and wellbeing of our employees and visitors. 'We continue to monitor the situation and Government's public health guidance closely. The rest of Windsor Great Park remains open as usual.' ThePrince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall had already pulled out of their spring overseas tour just days before it was due to begin. The Queen, 93, was due to visit the Bentley Motors Factory in Crewe, and the Jodrell Bank Observatory and Square Kilometre Array Global Headquarters in Macclesfield on March 19.She was also due to visit Camden on March 26, but full details of the trip had not yet been released. Charles and Camilla had been due to start their spring tour to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus and Jordan on March 17. Itwould have marked the first time a royal has visited Cyprus since the Queen in 1993. A spokesman for the Queen said: 'As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, changes are being made to The Queen's diary commitments in the coming weeks. 'In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, Her Majesty's forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden will be rescheduled. 'Audiences will continue as usual. Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice.' The Queen - the nation's longest reigning monarch - is due to turn 94 next month and the risk of more severe symptoms from the Covid-19 illness is greater for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. The day of engagements next Thursday would have seen the monarch travel to Cheshire to meet staff and apprentices at the Bentley factory, operate the Lovell Telescope at the observatory and meet local school children engaging in hands on science activities. The Queen wore large gloves when she handed out honours to recipients at a palace investiture on March 3. She also avoided shaking hands at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey and during a one-to-one audience with the Sri Lankan High Commissioner this week, but was back shaking hands with Professor Mark Compton, Lord Prior of the Order of St John, on Wednesday. It comes asThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on Friday revealed they would postpone their spring tour of the coronavirus pandemic. The overall week-long visit had been due to start on March 17 and would have marked the first time a royal has visited Cyprus since the Queen in 1993. Clarence House said the request came from the Government. Heir to the throne Charles and Camilla are understood to be in good health. The tour may be replaced with engagements in the UK, but not those involving significant gatherings of people. Charles was set to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina on March 17 and 18, be joined by Camilla in Cyprus from March 18 to 21, and head to Jordan together until March 25. 'Owing to the unfolding situation with the coronavirus pandemic the British government has asked their royal highnesses to postpone their Spring tour,' a spokesman for the royal couple said yesterday. While inJordan, the pair would have met meet King Abdallah II and Queen Rania of Jordan and taken in a number of other sites of cultural, religious and environmental significance across the country. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Charles would have seen the memorial at Srebrenica to mark the 25th anniversary of the genocide. Announcing news of their tour in February, they wrote: 'The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall will jointly visit the Republic of Cyprus and Jordan next month. 'Prior to this, The Prince will also visit Bosnia and Herzegovina.In the year of the 25th anniversary of the genocide, The Prince will visit Bosnia and Herzegovina where he will highlight reforms to improve citizens' lives. 'The Prince and The Duchess will make their first official visit to The Republic of Cyprus to recognise the work of the UN Peacekeeping Force and celebrate traditional Cypriot culture. 'Their Royal Highnesses will visit The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to learn what the country is doing to support refugees and showcase its rich cultural history.' Charles was due to start the tour by visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina todemonstrate the UK's increased commitment to BiH and the Western Balkans region, its support for reforms to improve citizens' lives. The Prince of Wales was then to be joined by the Duchess of Cornwall on March 18, as theyvisit to The Republic of Cyprus to celebrate the historic ties between the United Kingdom and Cyprus. The last leg of the tour was set to see Charles and Camilla return to Jordan from March 21 to March 25, to highlight their close ties with Jordan, underpinned by the long-standing, warm relationship between the two Royal Families. The couple would see how the country supports its one million refugees fleeing conflict, and meet members of the Jordanian Royal Family. The news comes after Charles shared a Namaste bow with Baroness Floella Benjamin on Thursday amid the coronavirus pandemic, as she collected her damehood at Buckingham Palace. The pair were spotted exchanging the greeting, which avoids any unnecessary touching of hands, during the investiture ceremony. Known to millions as the host of Play School and Play Away, Baroness Benjamin, a beloved children's TV presenter, was recognised for her services to charity in the New Year Honours List. The Liberal Democrat life peer has dedicated over 40 years to campaigning for young people and supports charities including Barnardo's, Sickle Cell Society and Beating Bowel Cancer. After receiving her damehood, the 70-year-old, from London, said: 'You get such a buzz from giving back and making a difference, changing the world, and to get an honour like this after these years it's like wonderful recognition. 'Today, it's giving me a wonderful feeling in my heart. I haven't done charity work for any ulterior motive but only to change people's lives. 'To get it, it is like wow, how exciting. But I'm still thinking: what more can I do? To me, it doesn't end here.' A 'huge admirer' of Prince Charles, Baroness Benjamin said she was 'thrilled' to receive her damehood from him on Thursday. Charles is not the first royal to take precautions, with the Duchess of Cornwall wearing a pair of leather gloves to shake hands with people she met at Cheltenham this week."
8,"Tom Brady, 42, reveals he is LEAVING New England as a free agent, thanks fans, teammates, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft on Twitter and insists he's a 'FOREVER A PATRIOT'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121413/Tom-Brady-LEAVING-New-England-Patriots.html,"Tom Brady is leaving the New England Patriots after 20 seasons, six Super Bowl victories, nine AFC titles, 219 wins, and three Most Valuable Player awards. The 42-year-old first-time free agent did not reveal his next destination, but he did announce his exit from Foxborough on Tuesday. 'Although my football journey will take place elsewhere, I appreciate everything that we have achieved and am grateful for our incredible TEAM accomplishment,' he wrote in social media statement. 'I have been privileged to have had the opportunity to know each and everyone of you, and to have the memories we've created together.' Brady paid Patriots owner Robert Kraft a visit on Monday night to discuss his decision with his long-time employer and friend. 'We had a positive, respectful discussion.' Kraft told ESPN. 'It's not the way I want it to end, but I want him to do what is in his best personal interest. After 20 years with us, he has earned that right. I love him like a son.' In a team statement, Belichick said it was a 'privilege to coach Tom Brady for 20 years.' Kraft also reacted to the news in the statement: 'The overwhelming feeling I have is appreciation for his countless contributions to our team and community.' Brady leaves the Patriots ranking second in NFL history in passing touchdowns (541) and passing yards (74,571).Only 11-time NBA champion and Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell has enjoyed more success in professional sports in the New England area than Brady. He and Belichick also rank as the most successful coach-quarterback duo, with 219 wins, 30 postseason victories, and, of course, their six Super Bowl titles. 'To all my teammates, coaches, executives, Coach Belichick, RKK, and the Kraft family and the entire organization,' Belichick's statement began. 'I want to say thank you for the past twenty years of my life and the daily commitment to winning and creating a winning culture built on great values. I am grateful for all that you have taught me - I have learned from everyone. * - NFL record 'You have allowed me to maximize my potential and that is all a player can ever hope for. Everything we have accomplished brings me great joy and the lessons I have learned will carry on with me forever. I couldn't be the man I am today without the relationships you have allowed me to build with you. I have benefited from all you have given me. I cherished every opportunity I had to be a part of our team, and I love you all for that. 'Our team has always set a great standard in pro sports and I know it will continue to do just that.' Brady also wrote a separate statement, thanking Boston-area fans, specifically. 'I wanted to say thank you to all of the incredible fans and Patriots supporters. MA has been mu home for twenty years,' he wrote. 'It has truly been the happiest two decades I could have envisioned in my life and I have nothing but love and gratitude for my time in New England. The support has been overwhelming - I wish every player could experience it. 'My children were born and raised here and you always embraced this California kid as your own. I love your commitment and loyalty to your teams and winning for our city means more than you will ever know. i can't thank you enough for your the support of our team. The packed training camps and should out stadiums and mostly the victory parades. I have been so blessed to share them with you all.' Brady had signed an extension prior to that season, which effectively served as a one-year deal that gave him the opportunity to become a free agent for the first time. Owner Robert Kraft previously stated publicly that he hope to see Brady back in New England next season, but the married father of three apparently has his eyes set elsewhere. Among the teams that were reported to be interested in Brady's services, the Tennessee Titans appeared to withdraw their interest on Monday, when they agreed to aa four-year, $118 million deal with incumbent starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill. The San Francisco 49ers, Brady's childhood team of choice, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Chargers, New York Giants and Indianapolis Colts are among the other teams reportedly interested in signing the California native. Until Tuesday there remained a chance that Brady would return to New England. He and Belichick discussed his free agency status by phone earlier this month, but according to multiple reports, that exchange was unproductive. The Boston Herald reported one source's claim that the conversation 'didn't go well,' while sources told NBC Sports Bostonthat the talks were 'not particularly productive.' NFL Network's Michael Girardi reported that the Giants recently expressed interest in Brady. 'Spoke with a number of NFL people over the last 36 hours or so here in Indy,' Girardi tweeted. 'The initial reaction has been 'there's no way Tom Brady is leaving New England,' but as you dig deeper, execs/coaches/scouts see the Titans, Raiders and Giants as possible suitors.' The Giants were not expected to be interested in Brady, havingdrafted quarterback Daniel Jones with the No. 6 overall pick in 2019. The rookie completed 61.9 percent of his passes for 3,027 yards, 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 12 starts (3-9 record) after replacing veteran Eli Manning. But first-year head coach Joe Judge would not commit to Jones as his starter earlier this week at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. Judge also has a relationship with Brady, having spent the last eight seasons on Bill Belichick's coaching staff in New England. And the Giants have deep pockets, with between $62 million and $74 million in cap space available, depending on whether or not they decide to keep several veteran players. A sixth-round pick in the 2000 NFL Draft, Brady was a backup quarterback until an injury to Drew Bledsoe thrust him into the starter's role in 2001. That season ended with an improbable Super Bowl run and an upset of the heavily favored St. Louis Rams to win the franchise's first NFL title. Brady and Belichick's relationship had soured somewhat in recent years, according to several reports, although the Coach still referred to his quarterback as 'an iconic figure in this organization' when speaking with reporters in January. In fact, the two have been complimentary towards each other in public, with Belichick saying in 2018 that there's no quarterback he'd rather have, and Brady telling Boston radio station WEEI last year that he gets along well with his 'great mentor.' In 2018, however, reports surfaced of infighting between the two over disagreements between Brady's trainer and business partner, Alex Guerrero, and the Patriots medical staff. Guerrero was ultimately banned from the sideline, but he and Brady jointly own a training center that sits near the Patriots stadium and practice facility in Foxborough, Massachusetts. One ESPN report claimed Brady bristled as Belichick developed his presumed successor, Jimmy Garoppolo, only to have Kraft pressure the decorated coach into trading the young quarterback to San Francisco in October of 2017. (Garoppolo and the 49ers took the top seed in the NFC Playoffs after a 13-3 regular season and ultimately reached the Super Bowl) As one team staffer told ESPN, it was Brady who 'won' the battle with Belichick, with the help of Kraft. While Brady's future is uncertain, the Patriots' quarterback situation is even less clear. Brady could be replaced by backupJarrett Stidham, or any number of free agents, including former New Orleans Saints quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. On Tuesday, the Carolina Panthers announced that they have given quarterback Cam Newton permission to seek a trade, although it's not yet clear if the Patriots would have any interest in the former Heisman winner and MVP."
9,"'Vulnerable' Prince Harry 'stands by' what he said in phone calls with Russian pranksters posing as Greta Thunberg and her father, but still feels 'violated', royal expert claimsÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8120967/Prince-Harry-stands-said-prank-phone-calls-felt-violated-royal-expert-claims.html,"The Duke of Sussex 'stands by' what he said in phone calls with Russian pranksters but felt 'violated' by the 'malicious' experience, royal experts have claimed. Speaking on the Heirpod podcast with ABC Foreign Correspondent Maggie Rulli, royal expert Omid Scobie revealed Prince Harry, 35, 'wasn't so concerned about what was said on the call' but had been left with 'a feeling of violation.' Meanwhile Maggie added that she found the prank 'gut-wrenching' and noted how the 'timing' had been bad for Prince Harry, saying: 'They got him to talk about a lot of personal things. They got him to open up and be really vulnerable.' In the toe-curling phone chats released last week, Prince Harry opened his heart about Megxit, being more 'normal' than other royals and how Donald Trump has 'blood on his hands' with YouTube stars posing as environmentalist Greta Thunberg and her father. Speaking on the podcast, Omid revealed: 'I spoke with a source close to Harry earlier inthe week.He wasn't so concerned about what was said on the call and that being out there. 'He stands by what he says, he's not there to hide anything from anyone.But it's that feeling of violation, it's not a pleasant feeling to experience.' He added: 'It also comes at a time when the Sussexes have been through enough.' Meanwhile Maggie added: 'It's just gut-wrenching. Anything that purposefully makes someone else feel stupid, it's just mean, right?' 'Listening to it, it's always tough when you hear someone open up and be vulnerable to someone on the other end of the line and to hear that flipped on them, is just so difficult? 'They got him to talk about a lot of personal things. They got him to open up and be really vulnerable.' She went on: 'They had just had this huge trip back to the UK, all eyes were on them. 'So to have it come out when the trip was still wrapping up and Harry was by himself. The timing was also just an extra stick-in-the-eye.' 'If it wasn't bad enough, now everyone is looking at you during this hoax.' In the phone calls, which emerged last week, the Duke insisted he chose to withdraw from royal life to 'protect my son' and said 'we are completely separate from the majority of my family' . When asked about Meghan he admitted candidly that 'marrying a prince or princess isn't all it's made up to be' and that their new life in Canada is 'much better' than serving as senior royals. He also risked a diplomatic row as he waded into politics with his comments President Trump and Boris Johnson, and his belief that the world was 'severely unbalanced in favour of bad leaders. His comments were blasted by experts, who said royals 'certainly shouldn't express political or party political views' and Harry should have been sure about who he was talking to before exposing his feelings. Royal commentator and former Editor of International Who's Who, Richard Fitzwilliams, told MailOnline: 'He was off his guard, in a vulnerable state. He shouldn't have expressed these clearly controversial views on Boris, and particularly Trump, with his 'blood on his hands' statement - unless he knew who he was talking to. 'Royals certainly shouldn't publicly express political or party political views.'"
10,Justice Department will DROP charges against two Russian firms accused by Mueller of helping to run a 'troll farm' to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favorÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120391/Justice-Department-DROP-charges-against-two-Russian-troll-farm-firms.html,"The Justice Department is poised to drop charges against two Russian firms accuse by Robert Mueller of helping run a troll farm that interfered in the 2016 election. Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord Catering were among three companies run by Yevgeny Prigozhin - known as 'Putin's chef' - that were charged with spreading disinformation on social media during the election in an attempt to influence the result in Trump's favor. But prosecutors say that there is almost no prospect of successfully punishing the two corporations since they have no presence on US soil, while the trial itself could expose 'sensitive law enforcement techiniques'. Prosecutors do intend to push ahead with charges against the firm accused of directly running the troll farm - the Internet Research Agency - and againstPrigozhin. The case was one of the signature indictments from Mueller's two-year Russia investigation. Together with a separate case against Russian government hackers accused of breaking into Democratic email accounts, it revealed a sweeping Russian effort to influence, or interfere in, the race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Concord was the sole defendant in the case to enter an appearance in Washington's federal court and contest the allegations. The case had been set for trial next month, making the government's filing all the more abrupt. Concord is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as 'Putin's chef' for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been hit with U.S. sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 election and is charged alongside his company in the indictment brought by Mueller. The company, with the help of a high-powered law firm, filed a series of motions over the last two years, including to dismiss charges and to exclude certain evidence from the case. In January 2019, prosecutors alleged that confidential material from the Russia investigation, which had been handed over to defense attorneys for Concord, was altered and disseminated as part of a disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the special counsel's Russia investigation. The files surfaced online in a link posted by a pro-Russia Twitter account. But the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Concord of leaking the material. Still, prosecutors argued that the company's request to have sensitive new evidence sent to Russia 'unreasonably risks the national security interests of the United States.' Some of the court appearances in the case have been unusually contentious, with the federal judge overseeing it chastising a lawyer for Concord, Eric Dubelier, for references in court filings to Looney Tunes and the 1978 raunchy comedy 'Animal House' to criticize the Mueller investigation. 'I'll say it plain and simply: Knock it off,' U.S District Judge Dabney Friedrich told Dubelier at a January 2019 court appearance. Dubelier, who has referred to the case as involving a 'made up' crime, has made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and even once accused the judge of bias. The judge rejected the allegation. But with the case approaching trial, prosecutors said they had to weigh the risk of potentially exposing sensitive national security information against the benefits of continuing with the case against a company that likely wouldn't face any significant punishment in the U.S. In the court filing on Monday, prosecutors said Concord had been 'eager and aggressive in using the judicial system to gather information about how the United States detects and prevents foreign election interference.' 'In short, Concord has demonstrated its intent to reap the benefits of the Court's jurisdiction while positioning itself to evade any real obligations or responsibility,' prosecutors wrote. 'It is no longer in the best interests of justice or the country's national security to continue this prosecution.' Concord Catering did not have attorneys appear in court, but prosecutors said they would seek to drop charges against that company as well because it too was controlled by Prigozhin and 'based on the likelihood that its approach to litigation would be the same as Concord.' Prosecutors vowed to continue to pursue their case against the 13 Russians who were named in Mueller's indictment, along with the troll farm that Concord was alleged to have funded, the Internet Research Agency."
11,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is not considering state-wide quarantine FOR NOW but reveals 19% of people who've tested positive for coronavirus in NY have been hospitalized and warns crisis will peak in 45 days,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121829/New-York-Gov-Andrew-Cuomo-rules-quarantine.html,"New York Governor. Andrew Cuomo said he was not considering a state-wide quarantine on Tuesday but that it was not off the table as he issued a grave new statistic: 19 percent of the people who already have coronavirushave been hospitalized in New York. At a press conference where he was asked about Mayor Bill de Blasio's earlier remarks that a shelter in place order was 'absolutely on the table' in the city of New York, Cuomo said he would first have to approve it. 'I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to contain any city,' he added. However during questions about other cities quarantining, he said: 'I am resistant to nothing. 'Whatever we do we will do statewide. Whatever we do, we will do regionally with the other states.' As of Tuesday morning, 1,374 people in New York had tested positive for coronavirus.Of that, 264 people have been hospitalized. In just a day, there have been 432 new cases, making it the hardest hit area in America. Cuomo said healthcare experts have told him the virus is going to peak in New York in 45 days.Then, he anticipated needing between55,000 and 110,000 hospital beds, along 18,600 and 37, 200 ICU beds. At the moment, the state only has 53,000 beds and 3,000 ICU beds. After delivering the sobering statistics, he gave a rousing speech where he told of his own 'heartbreak' at not being able to hug and kiss his own daughter. He asked retired doctors and nurses, if they are able to, to return to the workforce to help battle the cases. De Blasio appeared on CNN on Tuesday morning and was asked whether city officials would follow San Francisco's lead in implementing the order, which would allow New Yorkers to leave their home only for food, medicine and exercise. 'We're absolutely considering that,' the mayor said. 'We're going to look at all other options, but it could get to that for sure for the whole country.' San Francisco announced it's version of shelter in place on Monday - preventing people from leaving their homes except for necessities for the next three weeks. 'This is an extraordinary time in our nation's history. This will go down in the history books as one of those moments of true crisis and confusion and chaos. 'I lived through 9/11. I remember the fear and the panic that existed in 9/11 when a single moment, your whole concept of life and society can be shaken. 'Where you need to see government perform at its best. You need to see people at their best. 'Everybody's afraid, everybody's nervous. How you respond, how you react. 'This is a character test for all of us. 'What did you do at that moment? When all around you lost their head?' he said, quoting Rudyard Kipling. 'That is this moment. What does government do in this moment? It steps up, it performs,' he said. 'What does government not do? It does not engage in politics or partisanship. 'It is essential that the federal government works with this state. We cannot do this on our own.' Cuomo urged people, especially families, to get out of the house and take their children to state parks - where all fees have been waived to allow more visitors during the crisis.He said it was safe to be out in the open. Cuomo went on to say he too was feeling the strain of not being able to have physical contact with the people he loved. 'There is something to this lack of ability to connect. Don't hug.Don't kiss. 'We are emotional beings. It is important for us, in times of fear or stress to feel connected to someone. 'To feel comforted by someone,' he said. Cuomo added that it 'breaks his heart' that he cannot see his own daughter - who has not seen for two weeks. 'It frightens me to the core.' He said he told his daughter when he spoke to her how heartbroken he was not to be able to hold her and kiss her, but he urged the public to push through and said it was only a short amount of time. 'Be a little bit more sensitive. Understand the stress. Understand the fear. Be a little bit more loving, compassionate, cooperative and we will get through this time. 'We will lose people, yes. Like we lose people every year with the flu. We're going to be challenged and tested, there's going to be periods of chaos. 'We will learn from it and be better prepared the next time because this is not the last time my friends. This has been a growing rate of health emergencies and storms. 'We're going to get through it and we're going to get through it together.' Cuomo also spoke of the frantic scramble for trying to buy ventilators. 'China bought all the ventilators then South Korea bought all the ventilators then Italy bought all the ventilators,' he said.

12,NYC is considering a 'shelter in place' order and Bill de Blasio says economic fallout could be on par with Great Depression with city poised to lose $3.2BILLION in tax revenue in the next six months,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121307/New-York-City-Mayor-Bill-Blasio-considering-shelter-place-order.html,"Bill de Blasio says he is considering a 'shelter in place' order for New York City - a move that would mark a major escalation in the mayor's coronavirus containment efforts. De Blasio appeared on CNN on Tuesday morning and was asked whether city officials would follow San Francisco's lead in implementing the order, which would allow New Yorkers to leave their home only for food, medicine and exercise. 'We're absolutely considering that,' the mayor said. 'We're going to look at all other options, but it could get to that for sure for the whole country.' San Francisco announced it's version of shelter in place on Monday - preventing people from leaving their homes except for necessities for the next three weeks. It came as all bars and restaurants across New York City and the entire tri-state area were ordered to limit service to takeout and delivery. De Blasio told CNN that he expects those measures to remain in place 'for months'. He speculated that businesses could reopen no earlier than June and possibly as late as September. 'We need to have in our minds that this could be a crisis of at a minimum several months,' he said. De Blasio also said there's a strong possibility the entire New York City School District - which serves 1.1 million students across 1,900 campuses - will remain closed for several months. 'April 20 is when we're going to make our first attempt, but watching the trajectory it's hard to imagine thatâ€™s going to work,' he said. Addressing the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the mayor said he expects it to be as bad as the Great Depression. He called on thefederal government to take bold action and 'bail out the American people' directly. 'If they don't get that income, they won't be able to pay their rent, they won't be able to buy food, they won't be able to buy medicine,' he said. Shuttering all 27,000 of New York City's restaurants, bars, nightclubs, movie theaters and other common gathering places is expected to take a massive toll on millions of service industry workers who will miss out on tips even if they are still paid. Many independent businesses are also unlikely to be able to survive a period of prolonged closure. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer appeared on NY1 Tuesday morning and said the city could see a $3.2billion loss in revenue over the next six months. New York state currently accounts for 969 of the 4,736 cases in the US and 10 of the nation's 74 deaths. In New York City alone there are 463 cases and seven deaths. De Blasio announced the extreme shutdown measures on Sunday, writing on Twitter:'Our lives are all changing in ways that were unimaginable just a week ago. We are taking a series of actions that we never would have taken otherwise in an effort to save the lives of loved ones and our neighbors. Now it is time to take yet another drastic step. 'The virus can spread rapidly through the close interactions New Yorkers have in restaurants, bars and places where we sit close together. We have to break that cycle.' He continued: 'This is not a decision I make lightly. These places are part of the heart and soul of our city. They are part of what it means to be a New Yorker. But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality. 'We will come through this, but until we do, we must make whatever sacrifices necessary to help our fellow New Yorkers.' The New York City ban was set to go into effect at 9am Tuesday, but New York Governor Andrew Cuomo sped up the timeline by announcing a similar edict across the state effective 8pm Monday. De Blasio has not ruled out implementing a curfew for the city, as other areas have done. New Jersey announced today that a curfew from 8pm to 5am would ban all 'non-essential' travel in the state. Although that curfew hasn't extended to other tri-state areas, lawmakers in Connecticut and New York were 'strongly discouraging' travel during those hours. De Blasio's latest comments came as:  Both de Blasio and Cuomo have pleaded with the Trump administration to coordinate a national response to the outbreak, saying patchwork measures enacted by state and local authorities were insufficient to confront the crisis. Speaking to MSNBC on Monday, de Blasio said that New York doesn't have enough medical supplies to handle the outbreak and called for the Army to step in. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was slammed on Monday for squeezing in a workout at a public gym, hours before it was announced they would all gyms in the city would be closing tonight, after telling millions to stay home and practice social distancing. The mayor was spotted at the YMCA in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on Monday morning as the total number of coronacases in New York City hit more than 300 and businesses were preparing to shutter on de Blasio's advice. On Sunday, he told bars and restaurants they would have to close to all sit-in customers from Tuesday at 9am and said movie theaters and other public spaces would close. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo sped up the shutdown on Monday. It will now go into effect on Monday at 8pm and all gyms in New York City will be part of it. That did not stop de Blasio from going to the gym. By-standers called him an 'idiot' and told his security detail he 'shouldn't be in there' when they realized he was in the public building. His spokesperson issued a statement afterwards saying the YMCA meant a 'great deal to the mayor'. 'The YMCA has been a huge part of his and his family's life, like it has been for a lot of New Yorkers. 'It's clear that's aboutto change and before that, the mayor wanted to visit a place that keeps him grounded one last time.' 'That doesn't change the fact that he is working around the clock to ensure the safety of New Yorkers. 'After today, gyms will close and he will no longer be visiting the YMCA for the forseeable future,' a spokeswoman for him toldNBC. Gov. Andrew Cuomo was asked about de Blasio's gym visit on Monday during a press conference. He resisted criticizing him, saying it was still allowed to visit gyms until this evening. He said he had 'developed' his own workout program over several years that he completes 'alone'. Twitter users condemned de Blasio for the decision, which some said was as reckless as licking a subway pole. 'The US military right now is still engaged in building those border walls. Take them off that and put them on coronavirus for god sakes,' de Blasio said. 'This should be a reality where the United States is put on a war footing, where the federal government mobilizes all the resources necessary - and it begins with testing.' The mayor said broader testing is needed for the entire population, not just high-risk groups such as the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. He also expressed fear that hospitals will quickly become overwhelmed as cases counts continue to rise. 'We're going to have to set up emergency ICUs in hospitals, not only all over New York City, all over America,' he said. 'We're going to need the United States military to come in with their substantial logistical and medical capacity.' De Blasio compared the outbreak to America's darkest historic periods as he suggested that rationing food and other essentials may be necessary. 'The Great Depression and the New Deal are very instructive here, I'm not saying bread lines,' he said. 'This is a pure war footing right down to rationing if you need it.' Earlier that morning, Cuomo took aim at the Trump administration while explaining his decision to effectively shutter New York's bars and restaurants as part of an effort with neighboring states Connecticut and New Jersey. The governor said it made no sense for him to take harsh action in New York if neighboring states did not do the same, because people would simply migrate there to keep living their lives and potentially spread the virus. 'This government has to get more engaged. There's been no country that hasnâ€™t handled this on a federalized level,' he told Good Morning America. 'This patchwork quilt of policies doesn't work. It makes no sense for me to do something in New York and New Jersey to do something else. 'I close the bars? They go to jersey. You need the specific rules. 'Every state cannot come up with its own rules, you'll just have people going from state to state. 'You'll go to New Jersey, Connecticut, wherever you can be served. That's the last thing we want. 'Set the national standards and let's live with them.' New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are among several states to take significant action to curb the spread of coronavirus after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a memo on Sunday night advising against holding large gatherings of more than 50 people for at least eight weeks. California, Washington, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, Kentucky and Michigan have all ordered bars and restaurants to offer takeout food only.

13,"NYC bar and restaurant owners face ARREST if they break strict lockdown rules as 150,000 workers face an uncertain future",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121265/NYC-bar-restaurant-owners-face-ARREST-break-lockdown-rules-pledge-pay-staff.html,"New York bar and restaurant owners face being arrested if they break the city's strict lockdown rules and open their doors to customers, as the industry has gone into meltdown amid efforts to tackle the spread of coronavirus. More than 150,000 people across the city face an uncertain future as their workplaces shut their doors Monday night and threw their livelihoods into jeopardy. Some establishments including famous New York eateries Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe have promised to keep paying staff and to foot medical bills for workers struck down by the deadly virus. But many hospitality workers won't be so lucky and now face fears over how they will make rent and survive with no income for an indefinite time. The city that never sleeps turned into a ghost town on Monday night as all cafe, bars, restaurants and movie theaters shuttered from 8pm, after officials ordered the ban in a desperate effort to slow thespread of coronavirus. Under New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio executive order, the normally lively bars and restaurants are now restricted to take-out and delivery only. The mayor said New York will close its bars and restaurants for 'as long as necessary' along with casinos, gyms and movie theaters as part of an effort with neighboring states Connecticut and New Jersey to stop the spread of coronavirus. Restaurants, pizzerias and even Starbucks stores started placing signs on the front of their doors on Monday to inform customers that they would only be open for 'grab-and-go' options. Restaurant and bar owners have been warned that if they flout the rules and continue to stay open during the shutdown they could be arrested. Patrons and operators caught not complying with the ban could face a disorderly conduct summons and, in more severe cases, be arrested, an advisory to NYPD told CNN. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had previously called on law enforcement to come down hard on any establishments not following the rules when the state first ordered that bars and restaurants could remain open but that they must operate at just 50 percent capacity. The governor said if sites failed to follow the rules 'they were violating the law. if theyâ€™re doing that, then the NYPD should come in and shut them down,' he said last week. While the city takes the drastic steps to slow the spread of the deadly disease, the move may have left more than 150,000 workers across the city struggling for survival. About 154,400 people work in the cityâ€™s bars, restaurants, cafes and food trucks, taking home about $4.7 billion in wages every year, according to a 2019 report fromThe Mayorâ€™s Office of Media and Entertainment. Many workers in the industry are paid by the hour, and so lost hours means no take-home pay, meaning vast swathes of households will now be left struggling to pay rent and bills. Several of New York City's leading restaurants and bars have pledged to do all they can to support vulnerable staff during this turbulent time. The Union Square Hospitality Group, which includes famous New York eateries including Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, has promised to keep paying all staff scheduled to work. Danny Meyer, the groupâ€™s founder and chief executive, announced that all 19 of the groupâ€™s restaurants in the city closed after lunch on Friday ahead of the city's shutdown and would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Meyer promised to keep paying staff salaries as well as medical insurance for the next month and costs associated with treatment of any staff struck down by the deadly virus. 'Despite our closures and the total loss of our revenues, we will continue to pay employees scheduled to work through the pay-week,' Meyer said in a statement. 'We will cover employee premium contributions for medical insurance for those who are currently enrolled, for the next month. We will continue to cover costs associated with the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of coronavirus for any colleagues who donâ€™t have health insurance.' Meyer also recognized the toll the crisis may take on the mental health of staff and said support would be available: 'Finally, we are providing free mental health support for employees who need help.' He has called on the public to support hospitality staff and the industry by buying gift cards for local businesses to use 'when thesituation normalizes' and by using the delivery and takeout offerings from restaurants that remain open. The outbreak across the city saw the St Patrick's Day parade canceled for the first time in more than 250 years. Bars that would have recorded one of their busiest days were deserted as people stayed home and rules meant they could only take in half as many customers as usual. Orla Sweeney, manager of Connolly's Irish pub in New York City, expected St. Patrick's Day to once again be one of her bar's most profitable days of the year. Instead, the pub near Times Square was shuttered on Tuesday, like hundreds of thousands of dining establishments. Sweeney broke the news to her employees on Monday after Cuomo ordered the closure, and they broke down in tears. She said: 'They were like, ''Well when can I come back to work?'' And I'm like, I'm not really sure. In this industry, they live week to week, day to day, and right now they have nothing.'  Even prior to the closures, restaurants had been struggling to keep their doors open after sales were downup to 70 percent in the first week of March, according to the New York State Restaurant Association. New York's largest Chinese restaurant Jing Fong closed its doors after 48 years of service on Thursday when the50 percent capacity rules came into force. Claudia Leo, the restaurant's marketing director, told the NY Post that its Elizabeth Street site was already struggling to draw in crowds amid the mass panic over coronavirus. The ban on the large group gatherings last week had been the final nail in the coffin for the 800-seat restaurant. 'We were going back and forth on what to do all day,' Leo said, adding that they considered 'shrinking' the seating to less than half its full capacity. Just last week, de Blasio had urged New Yorkers to continue to eat at restaurants, and emphasized that the virus isn't transmitted through food and drinks.  Many other US states across the US also began shutting down their bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms. Monday also marked the first day of school closures for New York City, which educates 1.1 million students. The closure will last until April 20. Cuomo and de Blasio had previously pushed back against the possibility of closing schools in America's largest city because so many students rely on schools to have a healthy meal and closures would also affect the ability of working parents to stay in their jobs. The escalating measures came as the number of confirmed cases in the US surged passed 4,700 with 93 deaths as of Tuesday morning."

There are now more than 4,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US - though experts warn that is likely a drastic under-estimate - and 93 deaths. Speaking about the move, Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said:'We appreciate our customers' understanding of our decision and request they visit our stores later in the morning to allow at-risk populations the ability to purchase the items they need at affordable prices.' COVID-19 symptoms are mild for most people but the illness can be severe in older people and those with existing health problems. Dollar General said stores will also close an hour earlier than usual to allow staff more time to stock shelves, clean the premesis, and for their own wellbeing. Stop and Shop, a chain of supermarkets in the northeastern US with some 400 stores, also announced Monday that stores will now open an hour earier than usual to allow seniors time to shop. 'Although we will not be requesting ID for entry, we ask that you please respect the purpose of the early opening â€“ and do the right thing for your neighbors,' Stop & Shop said in a news release. Woolworths and Coles, Australia's two largest grocery store chains, have also announced similar moves after coronavirus sparked panic buying in that country. UK supermarket Iceland also said it was giving individual store managers a mandate to open early for a similar 'senior hour', if they believed it was warranted. As the outbreak ramped up across the US, the White House urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people on Monday and called for bars, restaurants, and other public venues to close. Trump refrained from ordering sweeping public quarantines, lockdowns or curfews for the time being, even as some state and local authorities independently imposed mandatory restrictions. 'We're recommending things,' Trump told a White House news conference in issuing new coronavirus guidelines. 'We haven't gone to that step yet' of ordering a lockdown. 'That could happen, but we haven't gone there yet.' Trump also said he felt that postponements of primary elections, like those announced in Ohio, Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, were generally unnecessary. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said on Twitter his administration was ordering polls closed on Tuesday in defiance of a state court ruling to the contrary. "

17,Heartbreaking sacrifice of New York nurse who has sent her two young children to live with their grandparents for a month while she works on the frontline against coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121143/New-York-nurse-sends-kids-away-month-fight-coronavirus.html,"A New York mother has made the heartbreaking sacrifice to send her two young children to live with their grandparents to avoid any of them becoming sick while she works on the front line of the coronavirus crisis. Jessica Chan told Good Morning America on Tuesday that she and her husband Nicholas Liu made the decision to not only keep their two young daughters, Jessica and Izzy, safe but to also protect his elderly parents. She is preparing for an onslaught of work, with thousands expected to soon descend on the nation's hospitals in dire need of care. Scroll down for video 'We were very afraid for their health and safety because I am a nurse and I will be exposed to a lot of patients. 'I could not risk getting them sick also because they will interact with their grandparents,' she said. She shared a photograph of herself kissing Jessica, her oldest daughter, goodbye before dropping them off. Her husband, who works as a research analyst at Oxford University Press, added: 'It's kind of a hard scenario to anticipateâ€™. He first shared the photograph on Facebook. 'We just sent my kids away to stay with my parents for a month. Juliette cried. 'With Jessicaclose to the front line, we cannot risk spread,' he said alongside the picture. There are now more than 4,000 cases of coronavirus in the US and 93 people have died. Cities are preparing to go into lockdown, including New York City where bars, restaurants, movie theaters, casinos and gyms are closed. On Tuesday morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was not ruling out a 'shelter in place' order to keep people in their homes. The governor of New Jersey has implemented an 8pm curfew to keep people inside, San Francisco has issued a lockdown and residents in the Bay Area are being told to shelter in place too. Trump said on Monday he was not considering a national shut down but said he issued guidelines that he wants people to follow for 15 days. They include staying at home and avoiding food courts, bars and restaurants. The New York shut-down had been planned for Tuesday morning at 9am. Cuomo sped it up on Monday, saying the tri-state decided to take matters into their own hands after a lack of action from the White House. He earlier pleaded with President Trump to order shut downs across the country, saying the 'patchwork quilt' approach of seeing some states taking more vigilant action than others 'is not working'. There are more than 4,000 cases of coronavirus in the US and 74 people have died. After Cuomo's announcement, shift workers in bars and restaurants panicked and started asking how they would be able to pay their rent. In Maryland, the city-wide shutdown will be in effect from 5pm Monday night. It applies to restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters. There has been no firm answer yet on how to alleviate the financial burden of the crisis on individuals. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told DailyMail.com Monday said the administration 'might' get behind new proposals to give cash to American households in the neighborhood of $1,000 each per month."
18,"The world shuts its borders: From Spain to Singapore, thousands of people trying to flee coronavirus chaos are made to queue for miles as country's restrict entryÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8122103/Thousands-people-trying-flee-coronavirus-queue-miles-countrys-restrict-entry.html,"Traffic jams swelled along borders and some travelers appealed to their governments for help getting home Tuesday as countries in Europe and beyond imposed strict controls along their frontiers aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Tens of millions around the world are already hunkered down in government-ordered isolation after many countries ordered stores, schools and businesses shut down to combat the pandemic. The border closures stopped not only people but also much-needed goods. Lines of cars and trucks grew after Poland largely closed its border to foreigners. In Lithuania, trucks seeking to enter Poland backed up in a line 37 miles long, while similar traffic jams could be seen on the borders with Germany and the Czech Republic. Lithuania was sending military airplanes and special trains to Germany to help hundreds of its citizens stranded at the crossing points with Poland. 'We are all desperate cold and sleepless here for a third day. We just want to go home' said Janina Stukiene, who was stuck on the border with husband and son. She said authorities were providing no food, accommodation or adequate sanitation. To try to help citizens from Estonia and Lithuania get home following closure of the Polish border, German police organized a convoy of vehicles to a ferry port on one of its Baltic Sea islands. Germany launched a Â£45.5million effort to bring home thousands stranded in popular winter vacation spots across the globe, including up to 5,000 in Morocco alone. 'Even if we will do everything humanly possible, we cannot in every case provide a solution within 24 hours,' Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned. Airlines have slashed flights due to a plunge in demand but also because many countries have been barring foreign arrivals. Turkey planned to evacuate 3,614 citizens stranded in nine European countries after flights were suspended, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. Regional authorities in Spain's Balearic Islands effectively locked down the Mediterranean archipelago by restricting all but a handful of daily flights and incoming boats for returning island residents. Its president, Francisca Armengol, said on TV that the islands 'will basically remain closed.' Spain, now the fourth-most infected country, saw the number of people with the virus rise by more than 2,000 in one day to 11,178 and virus-related deaths jump by almost 200 to 491. Only China, Italy and Iran had more infections. With the number of cases worldwide topping 185,000, a surge of patients in Madrid's hospitals has fueled worries in Europe and elsewhere of what lies ahead. The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people, but severe illness is more likely in the elderly and people with existing health problems. COVID-19 has killed over 7,300 people so far but more than 80,000 have recovered. Iran state TV warned that 'millions' could die in the Islamic Republic alone if the public keeps traveling and ignores health guidance. World Health Organization officials have said the number of cases there - nearly 15,000 with 853 deaths - have been sharply underreported. In Italy, reported infection jumped to 27,980. With 2,158 deaths, Italy now accounts for well over a quarter of the global death toll. Some bright spots emerged. Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus was first detected late last year and which has been under lockdown for weeks, reported just one new case Tuesday. The economic toll from the crisis to both companies and individuals was only escalating. Shares reversed early losses in Asia on Tuesday after the U.S. stock market plunged to its worst day in more than three decades. Huge parts of many economies have come to a standstill as businesses and travel shut down. 'It's shocking, in a way. I'm still in the throes of processing it. It means I need to find a way to support myself from home,' said Tyler Baldwin, a 29-year-old bartender in Seattle. A senior South Korean health official, Kwon Jun-wook, urged people to take the virus seriously. 'In a similar way to how the Sept. 11 attacks completely changed people's perception about security, quarantine authorities like us believe the daily lives of all the people around the world will be changed because of COVID-19,' Kwon said. 'From now on, if you are sick, you should voluntarily rest to prevent a spread to others.' Malaysia banned foreign travel and is allowing only essential services to stay open. France allowed people to leave home only to buy food, go to work, or do essential tasks. French President Emmanuel Macron said the restrictions were tightened because people hadn't complied with earlier guidelines and 'we are at war.' The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Somalia, which has one of Africa's weakest health systems. Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, said his foundation will donate more than 1 million testing kits - that's 20,000 testing kits to each of Africa's 54 countries - as the coronavirus starts to spread on the continent. Thirty African countries have confirmed cases but about a dozen lack testing capability. 'We cannot ... assume this continent of 1.3 billion people will blissfully escape the crisis,' Ma said. Bloomberg Philanthropies also announced a Â£33million initiative to help vulnerable countries, notably in Africa. As the pandemic expanded in Europe, the Mideast and the Americas, China and South Korea were trying to hold their hard-fought gains. China is quarantining new arrivals, who in recent days have accounted for an increasing number of cases, and South Korea will increase screenings of all overseas arrivals starting Thursday. Infections have continued to slow in South Korea's worst-hit city of Daegu. But there's concern over a steady rise of infections around Seoul, where new clusters have emerged. In the U.S., officials urged older Americans and those with chronic health conditions to stay home, and recommended all group gatherings be capped at 10 people. Americans returning from abroad encountered chaotic airport health screenings that clearly broke all virus-fighting rules against crowds School closings in 56 countries kept more than 516 million students home, the U.N. said. New York City joined those ranks Monday, closing a school system with 1.1 million students. Some countries that had resisted more stringent measures snapped into action, too. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to eliminate unnecessary contact with others, working from home where possible and avoiding bars, restaurants, theaters and other venues. Schools remained opened for the time being. Some scientists, and many worried Britons, have said the government should have taken tough action sooner. Britain's dramatic escalation of social restrictions to fight the virus was sparked by new scientific evidence suggesting that 250,000 people in the U.K. and more than one million in the U.S. might die if the country did not suppress its spread. The analysis, published by Imperial College London epidemiologists, drew on the latest data from China and Italy. It found that a strategy of 'mitigation' - slowing but not stopping the spread of the virus while protecting vulnerable groups like the elderly - would still lead to a huge number of cases that would overwhelm the health care system. The researchers estimated as many as half of all cases were not identified and that 30 per cent of hospitalized patients would require critical care. They also suggested almost 81 per cent of the population in the U.S. and U.K. might be infected during the pandemic and said the drastic social restrictions might need to be in place for many months, until a vaccine is available that could help avoid a rebound in the virus' spread. Michael Head, a global health expert at the University of Southampton who was not linked to the research, said the modelling estimates were credible and showed that Britain's aim now is simply 'lessening the impact of what will be a very bad outbreak.'

19,19 pensioners die from coronavirus at ONE care home in MadridÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121945/19-pensioners-die-coronavirus-ONE-care-home-Madrid.html,"At least 19 pensioners at a residential elderly care home in Madrid have died from coronavirus. The home is understood to be Monte Hermoso, near the Spanish capital's biggest park Casa de Campo. Health sources are saying more people at the home are expected to die. Regional health chiefs have sent ventilators and face masks to the privately-run centre and the sick are being taken to hospitals but some residents of the care home are said to be dying in their beds before they can be transferred. No-one was answering the phone at the centre, which offers day care as well as live-in facilities, this afternoon. The first cases of coronavirus at the home were made public on March 8. Rosana Castillo, whose mother is at the home, told local media relatives were informed there were 10 cases on Saturday but 70 cases the following day. The death toll is the worst reported so far from a single place in Spain, where nearly 500 people have died and the number of confirmed cases stands at nearly 12,000. Spain has entered a state of emergency as it attempts to stem the tide of new infections, with residents barred from going outside except to get essentials. Yesterday the country reported a 21-year-old had died from the virus, believed to be its youngest victim. The football coach, from Malaga, had also been suffering from leukaemia. Millions of Spaniards have stayed at home and residents in Madrid were filmed clapping for emergency services over the weekend."
20,Putin says coronavirus is 'under control' as Russia launches hi-tech system to spot empty supermarket shelves and track quarantined citizensÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121849/Putin-says-coronavirus-control-Russia-launches-hi-tech-virus-surveillance-measures.html,"President Vladimir Putin said the spread of coronavirus in Russia is 'under control' today, after touring a new facility built to spot empty supermarket shelves and to track quarantined citizens. 'We were able to contain mass penetration and spread' of the pandemic, the Russian president told a government meeting. 'The situation is generally under control despite high risk level.' Putin's comments came after a tour of a new coronavirus information centre in Moscow that is pulling together IT resources including surveillance cameras and artificial intelligence. Officials told Putin today that the systems can monitor social media for 'fake news' on the coronavirus and can spot empty supermarket shelves. A new app is also to be released to provide free telemedicine consultations, they added. Russia so far has 114 confirmed cases with no fatalities. 'Though medically speaking the epidemic has not taken on great proportions, the same cannot be said of the psychological aspects,' said deputy prime minister Dmitry Chernyshenko. 'The centre... also effectively fights so-called 'fakes' and rumours,' he said, citing a recent example when people began to share a false report of 32 deaths from the virus. 'Artificial intelligence, the neural networks that were trained to do a semantic analysis, identified the anomaly. A minute later the operator here had it... and Russian internet giants made their front pages to show only aggregated information from official sources,' he said. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, in charge of the state coronavirus response, said the centre has a database of contacts and places of work for 95 per cent of those under compulsory quarantine after returning from virus-stricken countries. 'We have identified where they are,' he said. 'When the person leaves the building we record it,' he said. Sobyanin also showed Putin images of well-stocked supermarket shelves on a huge screen. 'This is the analysis regarding food and other crucial products. You can see there is a televised online picture fed from surveillance cameras,' Sobyanin said, 'We also have images made by inspectors who go around warehouses and stores,' he said. 'This happens in real time.' 'We have agreed with (Russia's biggest bank) Sberbank that starting Monday, anybody who wants it will be able to download a free app... to consult a doctor for free, Sberbank will pay for it,' Mishustin said, before setting up a call with a doctor for Putin. 'This system is unique in the world,' Mishustin told Putin of the information centre.   "
21,"How coronavirus compares to history's deadliest pandemics: Visual timeline pits COVID-19 against Black Death, smallpox and AIDS - as experts warn current crisis could rival Spanish flu 'in its lethality and scale'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120631/Visual-timeline-coronavirus-compares-historys-deadly-pandemics.html,"The true scale of the coronavirus outbreak currently sweeping the world has been laid bare in a visual timeline comparing it to history's most deadly pandemics. It shows the bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, was the most lethal of all diseases, killing roughly 200million people in the 14th century. Smallpox, the second deadliest pandemic in history, claimed the lives of 56million people over more than 400 years before it wasfinally eradicated in 1980. By comparison, COVID-19 has so far killed 7,000 people and infected more than 180,000 since December. But it is still in its early stages. Scientists say the 'scale' and 'lethality' of the virus is on the scale of the H1N1 influenza strain that sparked the Spanish flu pandemic over 100 years ago. The 1918 outbreak killed off almost 50million people in just one year after racing around the globe and infecting a quarter of the world's population. The timeline, created by Visual Capitalist,shows that in general there has been a gradual reduction in the death rates of each pandemic, with Ebola, MERS and SARS all being contained quickly. Medical advancements and mapping the spread of infectious diseases havebeen powerful tools in mitigating their impact. But the infographic also shows that viruses can still run rampant and kill millions if scientists are unable to develop a vaccine. HIV has been able to claim the lives of around 32million sufferers since itfirst made the jump from monkeys to humans in 1981 because there is no cure. Humans trials of an experimental coronavirus vaccine began last Friday. Forty-five participants in Seattle â€“ which is currently being ravaged by an outbreak â€“ will receive the jab to test it is safe. None of the volunteers, who are aged between 18 and 55, will be infected at this point. Further trials are planned if the vaccine is safe. Dozens of pharmaceutical firms and universities across the world are in a race against time to create a COVID-19 vaccine. Leading officials have already warned a jab to protect millions could be a year away, meaning thousands will die in the meantime. More than 170,000 cases have already been confirmed worldwide, and at least 6,500 patients are known to have died. The World Health Organization says 35 experimental vaccines are in development, including one co-developed by the US government. The National Institutes of Health is funding the trial of the jab, which was created alongside Massachusetts-based Moderna. The first participant in the phase one trial â€“ the earliest stage of human drug research â€“ will receive the vaccine today, an official revealed. None of the patients will be infected with the coronavirus at this stage. All of the patients will receive the experimental jab at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The source who disclosed plans for the first participant spoke on condition of anonymity because the move has not been publicly announced. Public health officials say it will still take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine â€“ despite human trials beginning. However, modern antiretroviral treatments can control it and let patients live long and healthy lives. Leading experts are currently racing to develop a vaccine for coronavirus - the first of which will be tested on humans in April. But it could still be another year before the jab is deemed safe enough for global immunisation. The world's major cities have adopted a bewildering array of measures to fend off the coronavirus crisis, with some enforcing drastic lockdowns while others prefer a lighter touch. Some popular tourist hotspots such as Rome have become nearly deserted after citizens were ordered to stay inside to stop the virus spreading. Limits on public gatherings have been set as low as 50 people in Berlin and New York City, with Donald Trump suggesting a limit of ten for the U.S. as a whole. But schools, bars and restaurants are still open in London, where the UK government has been much more reluctant to impose draconian measures. Some cities such as San Francisco are threatening people with fines or imprisonment if they venture out illegally, while other authorities are still only offering guidance. In some countries such as Italy, the national government has taken command of the crisis and ordered shutdowns across the country. However, U.S. states and cities have more freedom to take their own actions, while Germany has also left much of the decision-making to its 16 states including Berlin. It comes afterGermany's public health agency warned the coronavirus crisis could last up to two years. The Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency responsible for disease control and prevention, made the claim on Tuesday as it strengthened the threat risk for Germany from 'moderate' to 'high'. It comes after German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday announced gatherings in churches, mosques and synagogues would be banned and said playgrounds and non-essential shops would close as the country reaches 7,000 confirmed cases, and 14 deaths. The Robert Koch Institute said the pandemic could stretch on for another 24 months aspandemics usually run their course in waves. According to RKI President Lothar Wieler, the length of time depends on how many people develop immunity to COVID-19 after contracting the virus, how many more people test positive for the illness and how long it takes to develop a vaccine. Dr Wieler did not rule out the potential for some of the emergency measures established by countries to have to stay in place for that duration.

Meanwhile German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the government has come up with some 50 million euros (Â£45 million)to bring home German citizens stuck abroad. He announced a drive to bring home thousands of tourists stranded in popular winter vacation spots across the globe - particularly people on package holidays in Morocco, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, the Maldives and Egypt.  Maas said the government is spending up to 50 million euros on the effort to bring Germans home over the coming days in co-operation with airlines including Lufthansa.

Meanwhile China reported just one domestic case of coronavirus today, as the outbreak continues to grind to a halt in the epicentre. The single case in Wuhan will boost China's view that it has 'basically curbed' the spread of the pathogen which emerged in the city last December. But the country is now concerned about an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day. In a reversal of roles, Beijing is now requiring almost all international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels. China also reported 13 new deaths today, raising its toll to 3,226. The country has recorded 80,881 total cases, but fewer than 9,000 people remain infected. As recently as last month, 99 per cent of worldwide cases were in China but the figure is now only 45 per cent. Nine of the 20 new imported cases were in Beijing and three in Shanghai, raising the total number of confirmed infections from abroad to 143, according to the National Health Commission. The country's progress stands in stark contrast with the growing crisis in other countries, with most of Europe grinding to a halt over virus fears. The number of deaths worldwide has passed 7,000, with more than 181,500 cases in 145 countries. Wuhan and its 11million people were placed under strict quarantine on January 23, with the rest of Hubei province going under lockdown in the following days. Authorities tightened restrictions in the city even further on February 11, confining people to their homes as health workers faced a daily deluge of well over 1,000 cases - a move officials say was critical in containing the virus. Other cities across the country also ordered people to stay indoors, and no new domestic infections have been detected outside Hubei for several days in a row with restrictions starting to be loosened. People who live alone, minors, the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying conditions are allowed to confine themselves at home. A Beijing medical adviser last week boasted that the world could bring the outbreak under control if it emulates China's measures. Epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan urged countries to 'get mobilised' and 'intervene on a national scale' to halt a crisis which is now spiralling outside China. Zhong, who is credited with helping to combat the SARS outbreak in 2003, warned that the current crisis would 'last longer' if countries 'do not treat the infectiousness and harmfulness seriously'. China is now focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by the containment policies, including the hard-hit airline industry. Chinese airlines reported total losses of 20.96 billion yuan ($3billion) in February while the total number of airline passengers fell 84.5 per cent year-on-year. Local governments must do their utmost to ensure people return to work as soon as possible, the official China Daily said in an editorial. Many businesses are still facing labour shortages and supply-chain disruptions, it said. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
22,Federal health officials warn there aren't enough masks and hazmat suits for health workers and EMTs facing looming wave of coronavirus cases - as White House considers HOSPITAL SHIPS to alleviate bed shortages,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121753/Federal-health-officials-warn-arent-masks-hazmat-suits-health-workers-EMTs.html,"Federal officials have told doctors and health workers the nation's stockpile doesn't have enough basic medical equipment like masks and gowns to meet the expected crush of coronavirus cases. The stark assessment, conveyed in a conference call Monday, comes as the Health Department has begun distributing supplies a national stockpile created for such health emergencies. But the administration is acknowledging the supply is 'finite' and sending the equipment out to priority areas and based on a population formula. With a looming shortage of beds that public officials fear could fall well short of demand in an outbreak, the White House is even considering the use of hospital ships,White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx said. The problem: the Navy only has two of them, and they can't get inland. 'The president is considering all of the options. We're looking at hospital beds, ICU beds, informed by the data from Seattle and Santa Clara, and I just really want to thank the governors and the health commissioners from those states who are providing us the on-the-ground daily reports of hospital utilizations,' Birx told Fox News. 'There are multiple options in our reserve, including the V.A. Hospitals, Department of Defense medical treatment facilities and even hospital ships. There are a lot of things to consider and all of those things are on the table right now,' she said. In New York state, 19 per cent of positive coronavirus cases are being hospitalized, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a televised briefing from Albany, in a state where cases continue to spike. Adding to the need are infections that have been identified among medical professionals serving on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak. 'It is essential that the federal govt works with this state and that this state works with the federal government. We cannot do this on our own,' he said. On Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar refused to say how many ventilators the government had and now many were projected to be needed, calling it a 'national security issue.' The following day, the administration announced recommendations that Americans not gather in groups of more than ten people and stick to their homes. HHS officials communicated the information to medical professionals in a conference call Monday, CNNreported, and said the nation's stockpile was insufficient to meet needs. The representatives from the office of theAssistant Secretary for Preparedness Reponses said the government had not yet identified a solution. Congress is trying to deal with the problem with new purchases, but it is not yet clear how quickly it will be possible to get equipment online. According to a statement released by HHS Tuesday, 'Because of the finite supply of PPE in the commercial supply chain, delivery of products from the SNS is prioritized based on need.' Equipment goes out to all 50 states, 8 territories, plus urban areas including Chicago, Los Angeles County, New York City, and Washington, D.C. 'The distribution is based on a pro-rata formula that is proportionate to the population size of each jurisdiction based on 2010 U.S. Census data. For areas facing high transmission rates, additional allocations are available,' according to the agency. "
23,Heartbreaking photos show woman announcing her engagement to her grandfather through the window of his nursing home because she can't go inside amid coronavirus fears,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8119671/Woman-shows-engagement-ring-grandfather-window.html,"Heartbreaking photos show how a woman who became engaged was forced to share the happy news with her grandfather through the window of his nursing home. Carly Boyd, 22, was proposed to over the weekend but restrictions over the coronavirus at thePremier Living and Rehab Center in Lake Waccamaw meant that she was unable to show him the ring close up. Instead, Carly was taken around to her grandfather's window where he could be seen resting on his bed. 'I really wanted to be able to tell my grandfather because he has dementia and there's no phone in there that he has access to,' said Carly said to KOLD. 'I just really wanted to make an effort to tell him.' 'The staff said 'Well we can walk around the building and we can pull the blinds up and you can tell him through the window' and I was like 'Yes, I would love to!'' she said. The facility's administrator, Gennie Parnell, took pictures of the touching moment as Carly showed off her ring. At one point, she and her grandfather placed their hands opposite one another on either side of the window. The sadness on Carly's face was all too plain to see. 'I just â€¦ it was very --oh my gosh, I'm going to cry -- it was very special,' said Carly. 'I got really emotional and really sad and I just put my hand on the window, and he put his there too. I just told him I love him, and he said 'I love you too and I hope to see you soon', like really see you.' Such restrictions arein place to stop the spread of the coronavirus and keep those who in vulnerable age groups , such as her grandpa, safe. Carly understands more than most what it will take. She is training at Southeastern Community College to become a registered nurse. Trevor Sellers. who works for the Department of Transportation is the lucky man who asked for her hand in marriage as the pair walked along the sandsat North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. 'We start walking out to the beach and he started telling me how much he loved me and halfway through I figured out what was going on,' said Carly. 'He got down on one knee and proposed to me and I was very, very ecstatic about it! I cried, he cried.' The pictures were posted to Facebook on Monday. 'Coronavirus didn't stop this granddaughter and grandfather from sharing this happy moment,' wrote April Bass, the community activity coordinator at the facility. Bass says the entire facility is trying its best to make sure residents are still able to contact their loved ones through phone and video calls - and visits to the window just like here. 'So glad I was allowed to see my grandfather, even under the circumstances of this virus I was still able to tell him I am engaged!!' Carly wrote on her Facebook page. The couple plan to wed next year."
24,Russia blames BRITAIN for the coronavirus outbreak: State media accuses UK of 'smearing something in Wuhan' and links the virus to Salisbury novichok attackÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120505/Russia-blames-BRITAIN-coronavirus-outbreak.html,"Russian state media has blamed Britain for the global coronavirus pandemic. Kremlin-backed media has broadcast propaganda which states Covid-19, the new form of coronavirus, was created as a tool for the benefit of the UK. As Britain continues to fight the pandemic rapidly gripping the world, outrageous slurs in Russian media include that: Last night Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, commented on the Mail's findings and said: 'We take disinformation extremely seriously and have brought together cross-government capabilities to give the most comprehensive picture possible. 'People must have access to the correct information and we are working with tech firms to [â€¦] make sure the most reliable sources are promoted online.' Britain was first targeted with Russian coronavirus propaganda at the end of January, two days before the first official case was confirmed in this country. The five pieces of disinformation analysed by the Mail were collated by EUvsDisinfo, a project of the European External Action Service (EEAS), which is funded by the European Union. Three were broadcast by Sputnik, a Kremlin-funded news platform created by a Presidential decree with the aim to 'report on the state policy of Russia abroad'. One was broadcast on Channel 1, Russia's main, state-aligned TV channel, and another was published in the nationalist leaning, pro-Kremlin Svobodnaia Pressa news site. It comes after ministers announced this week that they had set up a 'counter-disinformation unit' amid fears that Russia is spreading fake news about coronavirus to create panic. Last week a government source said the unit had already met to discuss the impact of disinformation linked to the virus. One British official said creating fears to 'spread uncertainty' and undermine the West would be straight out of the 'Russian toolbox'. US officials have previously claimed that thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts have launched a coordinated effort to spread alarm about Covid-19. Last month on Russia's Channel 1 â€“ the status equivalent of BBC One â€“ a special roundtable discussion on Covid-19 was broadcast on 'The Big Game', a political talk-show. The programme featured Igor Nikulin, billed as a microbiologist and former 'member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons'. EUvsDisinfo disputes his links to the UN. Mr Nikulin told the host that he was 'certain' coronavirus was a 'man-made disease' and said: 'the Americans and the British have already announced that they already have a vaccine. 'By the British I mean Porton Down, a well-known facility that has for a long time been working with chemical and biological weapons.' Questioned by other panellists, Mr Nikulin said: 'That's incidentally the same facility that I suspect was behind smearing the nerve agent on Skripal's door handle. 'Maybe they smeared something in Wuhan, Hubei, too, such as an escalator hand rail on the subway â€“ something thousands of people touch daily.' Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury, Wiltshire, in 2018. The UK accused Russia of orchestrating the assassination, and Porton Down â€“ the government's biochemical laboratory in the same town - identified the poison as the military-grade Novichok. The Kremlin denied the accusations, and State TV channel Russia-1 accused Britain of poisoning Mr Skripal in a bid to sabotage its World Cup. Earlier this year, the Sputnik Belarus website broadcast videos online featuring Dr Dmitry Belyakov, a social sciences doctor who claims to have worked at the Beijing Academy of Public Sciences. On 28th January â€“ three days before Britain formally left the EU - Dr Belyakov said in a video that 'the artificial nature of the virus, it all adds up to a single puzzle. 'A puzzle of the second stage of the negotiation with the USA, a puzzle of the idea that China must be limited, and a puzzle of the fact that there are a couple of days left until Britain leaves the European Union and becomes another global playerâ€¦ 'There starts the new bloom of the British Empire and all this plays in their favour. 'Britain inflates in terms of information all these moments and becomes a separate hub [to] the European Union through which can go the goods.' On 4th February, Dr Belyakov said in a video: 'The whole hysteria with coronavirus is an information and psychological operation based in the artificial ground'. Referring to the West, he said: 'Regardless of whom you hug or kiss in public areas, if the people in charge of these activities on the other side decide that the virus should appear in Belarus, it will appear. 'I believe that... you can agree or disagree... that there is a special operation ongoing. The players are the British-American Alliance, as I call them. 'Moreover Britain is now a free country, its hands are untied now. From the material losses that will now be in the EU. 'There are the links of one chain. Do not look at such a serious processes separately. You see, even the persons who head Britain now, Boris Johnson â€¦ Now there is going on economic collapse, leaving the Union, disconnection.' Days later Sputnik Belarus broadcast a studio discussion between Alexey Avdonin, an 'expert at the Institute for Strategic Studies' in Belarus, and Anastasia Miksyuk, an 'expert in international relations'. Mr Avdonin likened the coronavirus crisis to the opium wars of the 19th Century, and said that 'at that time Chinaâ€¦tried not to provide the British with the access to Chinese ports', but that the British gained access to the ports by offering to assist with opium addiction. The host replied that 'they have a massive historical experience in that', and Miss Miksyuk replied: 'Yes, they love it. 'I think it was Churchill who said 'England doesn't have friends or enemies. England only has business interests'.' While broadcast in Russian, not Belarusian, Sputnik Belarus would be mainly consumed by viewers outside of Russia itself, and via the internet. Edward Lucas, a security expert in Russian disinformation, said: 'There's a difference between what the Russians are saying about coronavirus in the English language version of Sputnik and the other languages versions. [Therefore], to the West, Putin looks respectable. 'Porton Down is always in their sights; [to them] Porton Down is an evil secret, and they want to make the Russians think that the West is run by very evil peopleâ€¦.The idea is to scare their own people, discredit the West in the eyes of the Russians'. Earlier this year, the ultra-nationalist Svobodnaya Pressa news website published an article titled: 'Coronavirus - Patent Found That Proves British Trace in 2019-nCoV: The British had a hand in a new dangerous pneumonia'. The article has been viewed almost 40,000 times. The author of the article, Alexander Sitnikov, discusses a coronavirus patent given to the Pirbright Institute in 2015. The Pirbright Institute, formerly known as the Institute for Animal Health, in Woking, studied the patent with the aim of developing a medicine for treating diseases in poultry. Mr Sitnikov cited online conspiracy theories which say that Covid-19 is a bioweapon which was accidentally created in the UK. 'Those 'advocates of conspiracy theory' who write on forums that '2019-nCoV is a biological weapon developed by the British, even if they pursued scientific goals' are not so sinful against the truth', he wrote. 'Leak of viruses is possible only in the case of a deliberate operation of special services, which would be able to obtain access codes. One researcher or a group of scientists will not be able to do this by accident or on purpose , even if they want to. 'Why, then,[do] the Anglo-Saxons point a finger at the Chinese? The situation, if desired, can be characterized by the proverb: 'The cap is on the thief.' The Kremlin issues weekly guidance to its state media for instructions on what themes to cover, and who or what should be given positive or negative coverage. These are weekly verbal meetings between media executives and Kremlin officials. But experts cautioned against attributing everything in Russian media as a direct message from the Kremlin. 'When Russian state interests are not directly at stake, there is always much less evidence of a coordinated script, and much more leeway given to media outlets and presenters', said Stephen Hutchings, Professor of Russian Studies at the University of Manchester. 'With a story such as the Coronavirus in which Russian interests [â€¦] coincide with those of other countries, there is little sign of a single, coherent narrative.' Dmitrii Simes, one of the moderators of 'The Big Game' on which the Porton Down claims were made, repeated several times during the programme that he did not believe the conspiracy theories surrounding Coronavirus. EUvsDisinfo declined to provide a spokesperson to comment on its work. But a European Commission Spokesperson said: 'The European Union has been actively tackling disinformation since 2015â€¦ 'In order to challenge Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns, the East StratCom Task Force in the European External Action Service (EEAS) was set up. 'The Task Force East [has] detected and exposed altogether about 7,800 examples of disinformation from pro-Kremlin media sources, such as Sputnik and RT.' A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in the UK said: 'The Russian Government has nothing to do with these views, which form part of a public debate protected by rules of freedom of expression.' "
25,China reports just ONE new domestic case of coronavirus in a day - but finds 20 more cases that arrived from abroad,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120313/China-reports-just-ONE-new-domestic-case-coronavirus-day.html,"China has reported just one domestic case of coronavirus today but found 20 more cases imported from abroad, threatening to spoil its progress. The single case in Wuhan will boost China's view that it has 'basically curbed' the spread of the pathogen which emerged in the city last December. But the country is now concerned about an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day. In a reversal of roles, Beijing is now requiring almost all international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels. China also reported 13 new deaths today, raising its toll to 3,226. The country has recorded 80,881 total cases, but fewer than 9,000 people remain infected. As recently as last month, 99 per cent of worldwide cases were in China but the figure is now only 45 per cent. Nine of the 20 new imported cases were in Beijing and three in Shanghai, raising the total number of confirmed infections from abroad to 143, according to the National Health Commission. The country's progress stands in stark contrast with the growing crisis in other countries, with most of Europe grinding to a halt over virus fears. The number of deaths worldwide has passed 7,000, with more than 181,500 cases in 145 countries. Wuhan and its 11million people were placed under strict quarantine on January 23, with the rest of Hubei province going under lockdown in the following days. Authorities tightened restrictions in the city even further on February 11, confining people to their homes as health workers faced a daily deluge of well over 1,000 cases - a move officials say was critical in containing the virus. Other cities across the country also ordered people to stay indoors, and no new domestic infections have been detected outside Hubei for several days in a row with restrictions starting to be loosened. People who live alone, minors, the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying conditions are allowed to confine themselves at home. A Beijing medical adviser last week boasted that the world could bring the outbreak under control if it emulates China's measures. Epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan urged countries to 'get mobilised' and 'intervene on a national scale' to halt a crisis which is now spiralling outside China. Zhong, who is credited with helping to combat the SARS outbreak in 2003, warned that the current crisis would 'last longer' if countries 'do not treat the infectiousness and harmfulness seriously'. China is now focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by the containment policies, including the hard-hit airline industry. Chinese airlines reported total losses of 20.96 billion yuan ($3billion) in February while the total number of airline passengers fell 84.5 per cent year-on-year.  Local governments must do their utmost to ensure people return to work as soon as possible, the official China Daily said in an editorial. Many businesses are still facing labour shortages and supply-chain disruptions, it said."
26,"Iran warns 'MILLIONS' of its citizens could die from coronavirus if the public ignore restrictions, as 85,000 prisoners are freed from jails and deaths spike by 135 to 988",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120389/Iran-lets-85-000-prisoners-temporary-release-coronavirus-fears.html,"Iran has issued its most dire warning about coronavirus, suggesting 'millions' could die in the Islamic Republic if the public keeps ignoring health guidance. A state television journalist who is also a medical doctor gave the warning after Shiite faithful pushed their way into the courtyards of two major shrines that had just been closed over fears of the virus. The country said today it has temporarily freed around 85,000 prisoners including political detainees in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus. It comes as deaths in the Islamic Republicspike by 135 â€“ a 13 per cent rise. The coronavirus has killed 135 more people in Iran, which has raised the death toll to 988 amid 16,169 infections. That's according to Iran Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, who gave the figure at a televised news conference today. Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said half of the prisoners who were released amid coronavirus were 'security-related prisoners'. 'Also in the jails we have taken precautionary measures to confront the outbreak,' the spokesman said. The United Nations has warned that inmates have already been infected in Iran's overcrowded and disease-ridden jails, and called for all political prisoners to be released. The judiciary spokesman did not elaborate on when those released would have to return to prison. Iran's COVID-19 outbreak is one of the worst outside of China. The regime has been widely criticised for its handling of the outbreak, including for its reluctance to shut down holy pilgrimage sites. Most cases across the Middle East have been linked to Iran, with many countries shutting down travel. Javaid Rehman, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, urged Tehran earlier this month to free all its political prisoners. Iran had already announced the release of 70,000 prisoners, but Rehman said only those serving sentences of less than five years had been freed. Political prisoners and others charged with heavier sentences linked to their participation in protest marches remained in jail,' he said. 'A number of dual and foreign nationals are at real risk if they have not... got it [coronavirus], they are really fearful of the conditions,' Rehman said. 'This is also my worrying concern and therefore I have recommended to the state of the Islamic Republic of Iran to release all prisoners on temporary release,' he said. Iran previously said it had 189,500 prisoners, according to the report Rehman submitted to the Human Rights Council in January. They are believed to include hundreds arrested during or after anti-government protests in November. In a February report, Rehman described how overcrowded and unhygienic conditions were causing the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis C. Quoting inmates, he said prisoners even had to provide their own soap. The United States has also urged Iran to release political prisoners, including Americans held on spying charges. 'The United States will hold the Iranian regime directly responsible for any American deaths,' U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier in March. In response, Iran's foreign ministry said Tehran had similar concerns about several dozen Iranians held in U.S. prisons, mostly for violating sanctions. 'The state of America's prisons and their health situation are worrying ... we are ready to bring the jailed Iranians in America back to Iran,' spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. 'American officials should pay serious attention to the health conditions of the Iranians who have been taken hostage in America. They have been imprisoned without any legal basis.' Pompeo said that any nation offering aid to Tehran should seek a reciprocal humanitarian gesture of releasing prisoners. Washington has long demanded that Iran release American citizens including father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi, Navy veteran Michael White and former FBI agent Robert Levinson. Tehran denies it holds people on political grounds, and has mainly accused foreign prisoners of espionage. Tensions between Tehran and Washington have been at a peak since the U.S. drone strike which killed top general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. There were also fears for British-Iranian prisoner Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after her husband Richard Ratcliffe said she was suffering from a 'strange cold'. He described her as suffering from a continual cold sweat and as having feelings of nausea at her jail in Tehran. A group campaigning for her release from custody on spying charges later said she was recovering but had not been properly tested. Italian prisons have also seen jailhouse riots after inmates were told they could not see relatives over virus fears."
27,"Times Square like you have NEVER seen it: Crossroads of the World, which normally attracts 330,000 visitors a day, lies deserted on first night of New York's coronavirus lockdownÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120739/Times-Square-attracts-330k-visitors-day-lies-deserted-New-Yorks-coronavirus-lockdown.html,"New York's normally thriving Times Square that sees around 330,000 a day pass through it was left virtually empty as the city that never sleeps went into lockdown. Businesses were shuttered as cafe, bars, restaurants and movie theaters closed from 8pm on Monday night as officials took strident steps to slow the spread of coronavirus. Photos of one of the most famous tourist attractions in the Big Apple showed a relatively quiet scene with only a handful of people walking under Times Square's bright lights. The square is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world and is usually teeming with visitors and local commuters. On a busy day Times Square can see as many as 450,000 people. Some revelers were seen grabbing one last drink before the 8pm social shutdown while others were downed shots before venues closed ahead of the curfew. New Yorkers, like many Americans across the country, have been told to hunker down in their homes and avoid large crowds and mass gatherings as much as possible as the number of confirmed cases in the US surged passed 4,600 with more than 80 deaths.Globally, there are more than 182,000 confirmed cases and more than 7,100 deaths. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the closure of New York City's normally hectic bars and restaurants on Sunday evening. The restaurants are now restricted to take-out and delivery only as of 8pm Monday night. The move saw New York'sSt. Patrick's Day Parade, due to be held today, postponed for the first time in its 258-year history. Multiple states across the US also began shutting down their bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms as cities like New York and San Francisco turned into ghost towns. Scroll down for video The mayor said New York will close its bars and restaurants for 'as long as necessary' along with casinos, gyms and movie theaters as part of an effort with neighboring states Connecticut and New Jersey to stop the spread of coronavirus. Monday also marked the first day of school closures for New York City, which educates 1.1 million students. The closure will last until April 20. Restaurants, pizzerias and even Starbucks stores started placing signs on the front of their doors to inform customers that they would only be open for 'grab-and-go' options. Orla Sweeney, manager of Connolly's Irish pub in New York City, expected St. Patrick's Day to once again be one of her bar's most profitable days of the year. Instead, the pub near Times Square was shuttered on Tuesday, like hundreds of thousands of dining establishments across the United States as state governments enforced closures to control the spread of COVID-19. Sweeney broke the news to her employees on Monday afterNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered all restaurants to close that night, and they broke down in tears. She said: 'They were like, ''Well when can I come back to work?'' And I'm like, I'm not really sure. In this industry, they live week to week, day to day, and right now they have nothing.' Kim Kolbert, the manager of Playwright's Irish Pub in midtown Manhattan, said: 'Obviously St. Patrick's Day is one day. This is our future.' Times Square's subway station at 42nd Street was nearly empty during rush hour on Monday morning. New Jersey has also launched a statewide 'curfew' between the hours of 8pm and 5am for all 'non essential travel' but it is unclear what that is or what will happen to anyone who does not follow the rules. Last Thursday Broadway suspended all its shows for a month after Cuomo announced a ban on all gatherings of more than 500 people. The state's governor, Phil Murphy, has not confirmed whether people will be able to go to work between those hours or how he plans to enforce it, but is only saying that he 'strongly discourages' anyone from leaving home between those hours. Cuomo announced the shutdown in a tweet on Monday morning after urging President Donald Trump to shut down the country to fightcoronavirusand said the current 'patchwork quilt' system of some states being more vigilant than others is not working. The shutdown had been planned for Tuesday morning at 9am. But Cuomo sped it up on Monday, saying the tri-state decided to take matters into their own hands after a lack of action from the White House. In an interview on Good Morning America on Monday, Cuomo said it made no sense for him to take harsh action in New York but have neighboring states like New Jersey and Connecticut not, because people would simply migrate there to keep living their lives and potentially spread the virus. 'This government has to get more engaged.There's been no country that hasn't handled this on a federalized level,' Cuomo said. 'This patchwork quilt of policies doesn't work. It makes no sense for me to do something in New York and New Jersey to do something else. 'I close the bars? They go to jersey. You need the specific rules. Every state cannot come up with its own rules, you'll just have people going from state to state. You'll go to New Jersey, Connecticut, wherever you can be served. That's the last thing we want. Set the national standards and let's live with them,' he said. Cuomo will relax liquor laws to allow people to order alcohol from their local bars and restaurants. After Cuomo's announcement, shift workers in bars and restaurants panicked and started asking how they would be able to pay their rent.But Cuomo said the rules would last for 'as long as necessary' to cope with the crisis. In Maryland, the city-wide shutdown began at 5pm on Monday. It applies to restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters.There has been no firm answer yet on how to alleviate the financial burden of the crisis on individuals. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told DailyMail.com on Monday that the administration 'might' get behind new proposals to give cash to American households in the neighborhood of $1,000 each per month. In Hoboken, New Jersey, a 10pm curfew is in place but it remains unclear how it is being enforced and what happens to anyone who breaks it. Despite Trump's insistence that the pandemic was under 'tremendous control' over the weekend, health care experts are bracing for a tidal wave of patients. There is grave concern over how the nation's hospital system will cope with the onslaught of patients who will soon need care. Over the weekend, experts predicted as many as 10 million people will need to be hospitalized because of the virus, but there are not even one million hospital beds in the country. Cuomo has repeatedly requested the army corps of engineers to come to New York and start fitting out available buildings as hospitals, saying the 'wave' of the virus will 'break' on New York's hospital system tomorrow if it they do not. 'We have been behind this disease from day one.We saw it develop in China, we weren't ready and we've been playing catch up ever since.You need to get ahead of this. It's about the next war.The next war is going to be overwhelming our hospital systems,'Cuomo said. Cuomo revealed that there are only 50,000 hospital beds in the entire state and only 3,000 of them are in intensive care units. 'The only hope we have at this late date is retrofit existing facilities.Get some of the people from the hospitals into those new medical facilities and back fill the beds with coronavirus. States can't build â€“ it's the Army Corps of Engineers.Let them come in today. Today. Time is short,' he warned. Other cities have implemented their own shutdowns but the federal government has yet to take a position on it. Trump told Americans to 'settle down' on Sunday and warned them to stop stockpiling supplies, saying food stores would remain open no matter what happened. However he is being widely criticized for his approach to the pandemic, which many say has been too slow from the beginning. In Georgia,Gov Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency after the confirmed cases surged to 121. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also declared a state of emergency within the city limits. She banned large public gatherings of more than 250 people until March 31. In California,Gov Gavin Newsom urged the state's 5.3 million people who are 65 and older and those with chronic health conditions to isolate at home. He also called for all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs in California to close. Officials in seven San Francisco Bay Area counties issued a sweeping shelter-in-place mandate Monday affecting about 7 million people, ordering residents to stay at home and go outside only for food, medicine and outings that are absolutely essential. The order says residents must stay inside and venture out only for necessities for three weeks starting Tuesday in a desperate attempt by officials to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. 'I know today's order is a radical step. It has to be. We need to act now, all of us, to protect the public health,' said Dr Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. It affects the counties of San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Mateo, Contra Costa and Alameda, which includes the cities of Berkeley and Oakland. 'History will not forgive us for waiting an hour more,' said San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, whose city is the most populous in the Bay Area and the epicenter of the area's outbreak. 'This is our generation's great test, our moment to stand tougher as a community. Amid our collective fears, we will find our uncommon courage.' In Southern California, Los Angeles and San Diego counties - the state's two largest, with a combined 13.4 million people - ordered bars to close and restaurants to stay open only for pickup, drive-thru or delivery orders. California's national parks and state parks remained open, but many parks said they were shutting indoor spaces, including visitor centers and museums. 'You can still walk your dog or go on a hike with another person, as long as you keep 6 feet between you,' Colfax said. He said officials from six counties met over the weekend and determined the unprecedented measures were necessary to slow the virus' spread, shield those most vulnerable to the disease and protect health care workers who are on the front lines of fighting it. Kevin Jones, general manager of Buena Vista Cafe, an iconic San Francisco restaurant that has been a draw for tourists since 1952 in the popular Fisherman's Wharf, said the order is 'going to hurt, but our duty is to protect our employees and our customers'. The cafe was the only one open Monday in one of the city's busiest tourist areas, and was almost full. He said he's worried about its 58 employees being able to pay their rent. Cafe ownersand managers decided any perishable foods would go to the workers. Michigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer said Monday: 'This disease is a challenge unlike any we've experienced in our lifetimes.' She issued a ban on dining in at restaurants and followed several other governors in closing bars, movie theaters and gyms. 'Fighting it will cause significant but temporary changes to our daily lives. ... This is about saving lives,' Whitmer added. Texas Gov Greg Abbott, a Republican, praised the federal government's response as he took only limited action amid the outbreak. Unlike other governors of heavily populated states, Abbott has not made explicit calls for limiting mass gatherings - instead leaving those decisions up to local officials. 'This is not a time to panic,' he said. 'It's not as if we have never been through this before. We've been through this many, many times.' Some governors have been hesitant to use their powers too aggressively. In Kansas, Democratic Gov Laura Kelly on Monday banned public gatherings of 50 or more people for the next two months, but stopped short of ordering any business closings. Missouri Gov Mike Parson, a Republican, issued a statement saying he strongly urged the cancellation of public gatherings of 50 or more but did not ban them, even as local officials in the Kansas City and St Louis areas did so. Parson also has refrained from ordering the statewide closure of any businesses, schools or colleges. 'Local leaders know their communities best, and it is important that they have the flexibility to make decisions based on what they feel is most appropriate to protect their communities,' Parson spokeswoman Kelli Jones said."
28,Google's website Verily offering coronavirus test appointments goes live in San Francisco - but all of its time slots filled in ONE dayÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8121605/Googles-website-offering-coronavirus-test-appointments-filled-one-day.html,"Google's sister company, which launched a site offering to help patients schedule coronavirus tests, ran out of appointments in just one day. Verily,an online health-information platform run by Google's parent company Alphabet, launched Project Baseline on Monday. The site was only available to residents aged 18 or older in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties in California and was meant to help them book slots atlocal testing centers. But, soon after going live, it reached capacity and, as of Tuesdaymorning, a message now greets visitors that says the site is 'unable to schedule more appointments at this time.' It comes just days after President Donald Trump incorrectly announced that Google was building a nationwide website to help people determine whether and how to get a test for the new virus. On Verily's website, the notice urges users to 'check back later' as the company expands this program. However, it is not clear how soon that will be and how many appointments were scheduled before running out. 'In these first few days of this pilot, we expect appointment availability to be limited as we stand up operations and that testing capacity will increase in the days to come,' Verily told The Verge in a statement. Verily did not immediately reply to DailyMail.com's request for comment. The company did clarify, however, that its program is not meant for people exhibiting severe symptoms such as 'severe cough, severe shortness of breath, severe fever.' The news comes after President Trump announced on Friday during a news conference in the Rose Garden that Google was working on a website to help Americans determine whether and how to get tested for coronavirus. Google later clarified that its tool would not be helping patients do that. Instead, the website will display information about how Americans can access screening, and list other information about local testing sites. It will also have a link to the screening tool being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The informational coronavirus website was supposed to be launched on Monday, but it will be delayed until later this week. One reason is thatGoogle says it's still waiting for more information about local testing sites to be made available. 'With local and national guidance evolving rapidly, Google will continue working with relevant agencies and authorities to roll out a website later this week that will surface authoritative information for people in the US, including on screening and testing,' Google said in a statement to CNN. In the US, more than4,700 cases have been confirmed and 93 people have died."
29,Anna Wintour slams Donald Trump's 'dishonest' handling of the coronavirus crisis as she backs Joe Biden in post cancelling the Met GalaÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121225/Anna-Wintour-slams-Trumps-handling-coronavirus-backs-Joe-Biden-cancels-Met-Gala.html,"Anna Wintour rebuked President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and threw her weight behind his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The Vogue editor-in-chief waded into the outbreak debate as she announced on Monday that the New York's Met Gala would be postponed over the pandemic. Wintour also used her lengthy post in Vogue to endorse former vice president Biden - who is racing against progressive Bernie Sanders - as her choice Democratic candidate to take on Trump in the November presidential election. The Vogue editor criticized the Trump administration for 'unforgivably' slow testing and treatment mobilization in response the the spreading contagion. This year's edition of the sartorially-focused exhibition at the Met is to explore 'About Time: Fashion and Duration,' and was as usual set to open with a star-studded bash the first Monday in May. But the star-studdedGala- known as 'fashion's biggest night out' - was postponed 'indefinitely' in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. The head of the fashion magazine's American edition said in a post on Vogue's website: 'Due to the unavoidable and responsible decision by the Metropolitan Museum to close its doors, ''About Time'', and the opening night gala, will be postponed to a later date.' Wintour slammed Trump's 'chaotic implementation of travel bans' and 'dishonesty with the American people'. She wrote of the crisis, before roundly admonishing Trump: 'Like everyone else, I have been experiencing this COVID-19 crisis as a series of hurtling developments, where one never knows quite what each new day will bring. 'I, like so many of us, have been appalled by how he has responded to the pandemic - the optimistic and fact-free assurances that all will be fine, the chaotic implementation of travel bans and claims about a ''foreign virus'', the narcissistic ease with which he has passed blame to others, his dishonesty with the American people, and worst of all, his shocking lack of empathy and compassion for those who are suffering and fearful,' she said. Wintour went on to praise 77-year-old Biden's vow to choose a woman as a running mate should the front-runner win his party's nomination. She added: 'I have been impressed with the wider field of Democratic candidates this primary season, but after Biden's decisive victories on Super Tuesday, I, like so many Americans, made up my mind to rally behind the vice president.' British-born Wintour - who has helmed American Vogue for more than three decades - developed a longstanding relationship with Barack Obama during his White House tenure, holding high-rolling fundraisers for the Democratic former president. She also had a heavy hand in Hillary Clinton's ultimately failed election bid in 2016, raising money for the former secretary of state as well as launching a voter registration drive. According to Vogue, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the glitzy event is held every year, the May 4 gala is one of a number of events that have been called off in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus. The news comes just days after the museum announced it would close its doors 'until further notice' after two of its employees were found to be suffering from symptoms associated with the disease. This is the first time that the event - for which tickets can cost up to $35,000 a person - has been called off in the 22 years that Wintour has chaired it, a job that she took on back in 1995 when she made her debut as the hostess of the star-studded party. Since then, the event has become a must-attend for Hollywood's most prominent and glamorous stars, with A-listers going above and beyond to embrace each year's fashion-focused theme, while also showcasing their own style credentials on the red carpet. Indeed, over the years, the outfits that have made their way up the famous steps to the museum have become all the more bizarre and over-the-top, with stars like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Jared Leto, and Rihanna pulling out all the stops to make a lasting impression. While last year's theme - Camp: Notes on Fashion - saw Katy turning up dressed as a chandelier, while Gaga did a full costume change in front of photographers, this year's theme,About Time: Fashion and Duration, was set to be even more flamboyant. And not only that, it was reported earlier this month that Meghan Markle was set to make her Met Gala debut at this year's event, with sources revealing to The Sun that the former royal was planning to attend alongside her close friend, British Vogue editor Edward Enninful. The source said Meghan was expected to adopt a 'glamorous androgynous' look for the prestigious fashion bash, adding: 'The Met Gala is for the Who's Who of showbusiness. 'Naturally Meghan was one of the first names on the guest list, and Edward's team are excited that the two will go together. 'Meghan is keen to step out occasionally without Harry so that she can establish herself once more in Hollywood.' Now it seems Meghan may well have missed her opportunity, with the Met putting a hold on the event for the foreseeable future, having already closed its doors to the public 'until further notice'. According to Vogue.com, an email sent out to staff members on Monday afternoon stated that any and all 'programs and events' due to be held by or at the Met through May 15 had been 'canceled or postponed', 'in deference' to CDC guidance that all gatherings of more than 50 people should be called off. This year's Met Gala was also due to be the first time actress Meryl was going to attend; despite portraying a character based on Wintour in the popular movie The Devil Wears Prada, the Oscar winner had never actually been a guest at the star-studded party. Her debut as a co-chair would have also been her first time attending the party - which was due to celebrate an exhibition around the theme,About Time: Fashion and Duration, which would have featured 160 pieces of women's fashion from the last 150 years. When speaking to The New York Times,Andrew Bolton, the curator in charge of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, explained the inspiration behind the new exhibit and theme. 'I wanted to do an exhibition focused on the collection, but not a traditional masterworks exhibition,' he said. 'Something that connects to the zeitgeist, and what people are talking about now.' The show, which was set to be designed by Es Devlin, who created the sets for Beyonce's Formation tour, aimed to create a timeline of women's fashion starting from the 1870s up until now. About 70 per cent of pieces featured during the exhibit were set to come from the museum's current collection. The other 30 per cent would have come from outside donors. Bolton and his team picked the theme on the heels of last gala's Camp: Notes of Fashion theme, which proved to be a huge success for the museum. Although attendance at the event has reportedly waned over the last couple of years, the event is still widely viewed as being the hottest - and most expensive - ticket in the industry, with a single chair said to be priced at a whopping $35,000, while tables can run anywhere from $200,000 to $300,000. Although the inner workings of the Met Gala have always been kept tightly under wraps, Wintour offered intrigued fashion fans a slight insight into the behind-the-scenes planning back in 2016 when she allowed documentary filmmakers to follow the process for the movie The First Monday in May. In the documentary, viewers were given the chance to see just how much control Wintour has over every aspect of the event, from the guest list to the table arrangements to the performances. The Vogue Editor-in-Chief is also known for implementing a strict list of rules at the event - although they are not always followed by attendees, particularly when it comes to the alleged social media ban, which is usually flouted by almost every single star in attendance. Some celebrities have even decided not to attend; Gwyneth Paltrow dubbed it 'un-fun,' 'crowded,' and 'boiling,' while Amy Schumer called the ball 'punishment.' No selfies In a world where publicity is of the utmost importance, it is hard to believe that celebrities would be discouraged from sharing selfies and personal photos from inside the Met Gala, but Wintour had done just that. Since 2015, the editor, who is known for hating selfies, has banned attendees from taking photos and videos on their cellphones in an effort to keep them from posting them on their social media pages. Of course, there are plenty of celebrities who break the rule year after year. Taking a bathroom selfie has become somewhat of a right of passage for the A-list attendees who are looking to give their fans a behind-the-scenes look at the gala. Kim Kardashian, her half-sister Kylie Jenner, and Ariana Grande were among those who couldn't resist posing for selfies at last year's event, and it's likely that many people will be ignoring the unpopular ban on Monday evening as well. No cellphones Not only has Wintour banned her Met Gala guests from taking photos, but she has also forbidden cellphones all together because she wants her guests conversing. 'Anna is sort of an old-school traditionalist. She likes a dinner party where people are actually speaking to each other,' former Met Gala planner Sylvana Durrett explained in 'The First Monday in May,' a documentary about the 2015 event. Durrett admitted that staffers will even go as far as checking on people's cellphone usage throughout the night. 'We aren't sitting over people's shoulders, but if it's an obvious thing we might gently remind them,' she said. No smoking It's no secret that smoking indoors is illegal in New York City, but some celebrities acted like they were at a private house party when they lit up in the bathroom at the Met Gala in 2017. Bella Hadid, Dakota Johnson, Behati Prinsloo, Marc Jacobs, and Frances Bean Cobain were among the stars who were photographed puffing away inside the event, much to the displeasure of museum donors. 'As a donor to the Met, I was so insulted to see all these 'celebrities' smoking and taking selfies of themselves in the bathroom,' one person told Page Six. 'Mostly, it's disrespectful to the art collection, which needs to be kept 100 per cent smoke-free. I would honestly like to see these people fined by the city.' 2018's invites specified that smoking was banned inside the museum, and there were also 'No Smoking' signs inside the venue. There were also reportedly staffers sniffing for smoke outside the bathrooms, according to Page Six. No messy foods or garlic breath Wintour takes great care in choosing the menu for the Met Gala, and she is quick to nix any foods that can get stuck in people's teeth, cause bad breath, or are too sloppy to eat. In 'The First Monday in May,' one former Vogue spoke of the vast number of demands Wintour placed on the organizers in 2015. She banned parsley from served at the party 'because you don't want that stuck in your teeth.' Dishes were also to be prepared without onion and garlic, which gives bad breath. Appetizers like bruschetta were also off the menu for fear of the difficult to eat dish landing on someone's dress. No minors Dancer and actress Maddie Ziegler, now 17, surprised people in 2018 when she revealed she wouldn't be attending the Met Gala because she was too young. 'I can't go, because I'm not old enough!' she told the Hollywood Reporter. Although Jaden and Willow Smith were underage when they attended the Met Gala in 2016, the rules have since changed. Planners confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter last year that minors will no longer be allowed to attend the extravaganza, saying 'it was not an appropriate event for people under 18.' No publicists Most guests aren't allowed to bring their personal publicists on their red carpet with them or inside the venue, according to Page Six. Without their publicists to help them navigate interviews, photo ops, and wardrobe malfunctions, celebrities are left to fend for themselves, which can add to the stress of the night. No spouses seated together The documentary 'The First Monday in May' reveals the level of tedious planning that goes into the seating arrangements a the gala. 'A lot of thought goes into who sits next to who, if they sat together last year, if they've sat next to each other at other events, so much goes into it, it's shocking,' Durrett said. In one scene, it was revealed that Wintour seated George Clooney's wife Amal several seats away from him at the 2015 Met Gala. The editor-in-chief was also less than pleased that another guest asked to bring her husband, but she relented on the condition that he didn't spend the entire night on his cellphone. Durrett explained that Wintour doesn't like to seat spouses next to each other because it prevents them from mingling. 'The whole point of these things is to meet new people, and to be interested in what others are doing. What's the point if you come here to hang out with your husband?' she said. Never refuse an invite â€” unless you are super famous It's considered an honor to be invited to the Met Gala, and it has been reported that Wintour does not react kindly to those who turn her down. More often than not, celebrities who skip the event are not invited back unless they are Beyonce level famous. 'I know people who decided not to go one year because they weren't around or didn't like the theme,' a socialite told Page Six in 2017. 'Once you do that, you're not invited back unless you're triple A-list.'"
30,"Los Angeles County release 600 inmates, cut daily arrests from 300 to 60 as it joins other prisons in guarding against coronavirus spread",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121651/Los-Angeles-County-release-600-inmates-cuts-daily-arrests-300-60-against-coronavirus-spread.html,"Prisons in California, Illinois and Ohio are releasing hundreds of inmates early to decrease prison populations and combat the potential spread of thecoronavirusamong inmates as some prosecutors say they will not be pursuing 'low-level crimes'. As of Tuesday morning, no prison in the United States has reported a case of COVID-19 but many county, state, and federal jails and courthouses are beginning to take preventative measures to ensure the safety of inmates. Inmates are considered high risk because of their inability to social distance from others and their limited access to basic hygiene measures. In response, Los Angeles County in California, Cuyahoga County in Ohio, andCook County in Illinois have released or are planning to release inmates to allow for more space of social distancing and self-isolation. In Brooklyn, 'low-level crimes' will also not be prosecuted, to limit potential exposure to the virus for employees and visitors. Los Angeles County has decreased its prison population by 600 people to combat the potential spread of thecoronavirus among inmates. Early release is being granted to those with less than 30 days on their sentence, reducing inmates from 17,076 to 16,459 since the end of February. The LA County sheriff is also asking officers to cite and release offenders when possible, which has reduced the daily number of arrests from 300 to 60. The moves in LA County, where there are 94 coronavirus cases and one death, have seen daily arrests drop from 300 to 60, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said Monday at a news conference. He added that the aggregate bond amount for people to be booked also went up from $25,000 to $50,000. 'Our population within the jail is a vulnerable population just by virtue of who they are and where they're located,' he said. 'So, we're protecting that population from potential exposure.' There are already nine inmates in the county in isolation at a correctional treatment center, 21 inmates in quarantine at the Men's Central Jail and five in quarantine at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility. Staff in these locations are said to be taking the temperature of anyone entering, looking for fevers. But staff themselves are also at risk and several have already been placed in self-isolation. 'Over the weekend, we've had several of our personnel come into contact, and they have been self-isolated,' Villanueva said. 'However, fortunately, no one has actually tested positive for the virus.' Other prisons around the country are taking measures to prevent spread among inmates and staff.  The U.S.'s 122 federal prisons and many of the 1,700-plus state prisons have banned visitors and volunteers. The Federal Bureau of Prisons announced its ban Friday, joining most state and county prisons. They have also banned lawyer visits for 30 days. In response, many federal prisons are increasing the number of prisoner phone calls or the total number of minutes allotted. Prisons in Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio and South Dakota are looking to expand video calling abilities for inmates. In Cleveland, Ohio, Cuyahoga County's common pleas court held extra hearings on Saturday to try and clear the prison population, releasing 200 people since Friday. Those released were said to be low-level, non-violent inmates who have been placed on probation or released by having their bond reduced to a manageable level. 'We are trying to make as much room as possible, so when this virus hits our jail, the jail can deal with these people, quarantine them and deal with it instead of letting them sit there and infect the whole entire jail,'said Administrative Judge Brendan Sheehan. 'You gotta remember, the goal of this is to protect the community and the safety of the inmates. If someone's a serious violent person, well, we're using our discretion to make sure the community's safe also,' he added. And in Cook County in Illinois, talks are underway to begin the compassionate release of inmates with exceptional health care needs who don't pose a threat or a flight risk. Sheriff Tom Dart said the first of those early exits was secured on Monday. 'The office has already secured the release of several detainees deemed to be highly vulnerable to COVID-19, including a pregnant detainee and another detainee who was hospitalized for treatment not related to the virus,' the sheriff's office said in a statement. 'Additionally, staff are reaching out to other jurisdictions regarding detainees who are in custody due to outstanding warrants on low-level offenses. Sheriff's staff are asking those jurisdictions to either quash those warrants or geographically limit them so that those detainees can be released from Cook County Jail.' New arrivals in Cook County Jail, which has a population of 5,600, will now be kept in a receiving area to be monitored for symptoms before being placed with the general population and in Illinois state prisons, the 40,000 inmates plus staff will have increased access to hand santitizer and soap. In Massachusetts, Essex County Sheriff Kevin Coppinger's office revealed that 30 men who had been in community sober homes are now at the jail's pre-release center so that they could be monitored for illness. Sheriff Coppinger said that it was so treatment could be provided on site if the men became ill. And in Houston, Texas, the Harris County Juvenile Court announced that the court wing will be fully closed to all until further notice. A person who had been at the court tested positive for the coronavirus, as did an employee at a correctional facility in Pennsylvania, where 34 inmates and staffers are now in quarantine. In Brooklyn, District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said Tuesday that low-level offenses that don't jeopardize public safety will not be prosecuted amid the outbreak in an attempt to reduce the potential exposure of employees and visitors to the virus during the arrest, processing and detention process. 'During this public health emergency, it is imperative that we also protect those who might be exposed to the coronavirus during the procedures of arrest, processing and detention in Central Booking,' he said in a statement posted to Twitter, adding that they will'immediately decline to prosecute low-level offenses that don't jeopardize public safety'. The preventative actions come afterevidence from previous outbreaks, such as an outbreak of mumps in Texas and New Jersey jails in 2019, highlighted the risk to the country's prison population. Prisoners havelimited access to basic hygiene measures and high rates of existing health issues. Those being held in handcuffs also can't cough into their elbow as advised and alcohol-based santizer is considered contraband in many US prisons. U.S. prisoners have a higher than average rate of HIV and are more likely to be smokers than the general population. And they are an aging population. From 1990 to 2012, the US prison population aged 55 and older increased by 550%. Inmates have no way to social distance or self-isolate if there was an outbreak in a prison. 'You can't keep a 2- to 3-foot distance from inmates, and they can't keep that distance themselves,' Ray Coleman Jr., a teacher at the federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, told CNN. Some experts have advised that the only way to fight against a prison coronavirus outbreak is to reduce the number of imprisoned people. This method was used in Iran, the country with the third worst outbreak, with 70,000 prisoners temporarily released after China reported three provinces with more than 500 cases in prisons during the height of their outbreak. 'In the best of scenarios, we would only hope to delay this,' Josiah Rich, a Brown University epidemiologist and director of the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights, told The Guardian. 'And because we have so many ill people behind bars, it's going to get there, it's going to spread like wildfire.' The United States accounts for 22 percent of the world's prison population with around 2.3 million people incarcerated."
31,Shocking footage shows packed Florida beach on same day Trump urged ALL Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 and practice self-distancing amid coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8119647/Shocking-images-crowds-sand-Clearwater-Beach-Florida-ignoring-coronavirus-warnings.html,"Clearwater Beach, Florida, was packed with visitors who appeared to have not heeded warnings to social distance themselves as part of efforts to help slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Images and footage from the snow-white beach along Florida's west coast showed sun worshipers and spring breakers packed on the sand this weekend. While some beaches on the east coast were closed due to the deadly flu-like virus, also known as COVID-19, crowds still came, despite the warnings. Tampa beaches near Clearwater also were open and busy this weekend, reports WFLA. The coronavirus pandemic has been blamed for 6,500 deaths around the globe. There have been more than 4,700 confirmed cases and more than 90 deaths from the infection in the US. Cities and states around the nation have responded to the outbreak by closing schools and shuttering bars, restaurants and venues where large gatherings take place, asking people to social distance themselves until the virus is contained. Despite the efforts, hundreds of college spring breakers still defied orders from police to stop partying on the beach after a stretch ofFlorida's South Beach was closed due to coronavirus fears. Instead of returning home when the famed party strip was closed on Saturday afternoon many students continued the week of celebrations further down the coast on other parts of the beach. The most popular parts of the beach closed to the public from 4.30pm Saturday and are set to remain shut until March 19 with Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber declaring that spring break in Miami Beach is 'over' after a state of emergency was declared Thursday. With 149 positive cases of coronavirus in the state of Florida, many of whom are teens or in their early twenties, the Centers for Disease Control has advised that all events with more than 50 people attending should be cancelled. Four people in the state have died from the virus. Despite warning signs at the entry of the beach advising against mass gatherings and urging beach goers to practice social distancing the crowds of students continued to pour in throughout Sunday. In close physical proximity the crowds appeared to disregard the warnings put forward by the CDC. City Manager Jimmy Morales enacted the emergency measures over the weekend as party-hungry college students continued to travel to the popular spring break destination, despite the threat of the coronavirus outbreak and the news that President Trump is considering domestic travel restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control even greeted beachgoers with a floating billboard on Saturday which urged sunbathers to avoid contact with other people who are sick. Morales went a step further as the cases in Florida began to jump, opening up Ocean Drive to cars and deciding to close public beaches from seventh to tenth street along South Beach from 4.30pm Saturday to limit gatherings of spring breakers - the closure has now extended from Fifth to 15th streets. In an email to Gelber, Morales claimed that spring breakers 'don't seem to care about viruses' but that these measures should go some way to cutting down potentially harmful large gatherings. 'Miami Beach is a popular vacation spot for spring breakers, yet with school closings and expanded spring breaks, the influx of visitors is extremely high,' Gelber said. 'It would be irresponsible for us not to limit crowd sizes in these public areas. 'Not only for our residents and visitors, but for the health and safety of our first responders. 'We cannot continue to put them at risk by asking them to expose themselves to the possibility of contracting this virus.'  Restaurants in the area with a capacity of more than 250 people were told to reduce the number of people they serve or close. The city announced on Monday: 'Starting 3/16 non-essential businesses will be required to close daily by 10PM & there will be a curfew in the Entertainment District from 11PM - 5AM.' Some schools in the state have also closed due to the threat posed by the virus. Addressing the students, Gelber told Sun Sentinel: 'You have a mother, you have a grandmother and maybe a great-grandmother. That virus can be extremely dangerous to them.' Police are present on the closed main stretch of South Beach from Fifth Street to 15th Street. People who violate the closure could be hit with a $500 fine or face up to 60 days in jail. Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a press conference: 'Florida is not going to be a place where you are going to be out until 2am with 500 people in some bar. Those gatherings present high risks.'"
32,Uber suspends its pool option in US and Canada to limit the spread of coronavirusÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8121593/Uber-suspends-pool-option-Canada-limit-spread-coronavirus.html,"Uber Pool has been suspended in the US and Canada to help limit the spread of the coronavirus. The pooled option allows riders to book trips at lower prices by sharing the car with up to three other passengers traveling in the same direction. However, the ride-sharing giant has disabled the option in order to help the public maintain social distancing during the pandemic. Regular rides and the firm's food delivery platform Uber Eats remain available, but Uber said it was in contact with local authorities to adjust operations as needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging social distancing as the coronavirus spreads from person-to-person. The agency is recommended people maintain at least three feet (one meter) distance between yourself and someone else. Coronavirus began in China last December and has quickly made its way across the globe. As of Tuesday, there have been over 188,000 confirmed cases and more than 7,000 deaths around the world - with 4,736 of those cases and 93 deaths in the US. And it appears Uber is doing its part to help limit the spread of the virus. Senior vice president Uber Rides and Platform Andrew Macdonald said in a statement: Our goal is to help flatten the curve on community spread in the cities we serve.' Uber also noted that it will take similar steps outside of the US and Canada on a case-by-case basis. The Uber app on Tuesday morning listed the Pool option as 'unavailable' when the user entered a destination. In addition to suspending its carpooling service, Uber is showing users in the US and Canada a message urging them to 'travel only when necessary.' The firm is also encouragingriders to wash their hands before and after a ride and asking them to sit in the backseat to help protect its drivers. Uber also announced Monday that it is waiving delivery fees for independent restaurants across the US and Canada. Uber Eats is the latest aggregator to suspend commission from restaurants hit by the coronavirus outbreak, following in the footsteps of GrubHub and Postmates. This comes at a time where many US states have begun closing establishments and only offering delivery as an option. Hoboken, New Jersey was the first city to implement a bar and restaurant shut down and shortly after the entire state, as well as New York and Connecticut, have followed in suit. "
33,"Toilet roll sales soar by nearly 1,000% on Amazon while online retailer shifts double the numbers of aspirin, cereal and batteries compared to last year",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120729/Toilet-roll-sales-soar-nearly-1-000-Amazon.html,"Toilet roll sales have gone through the roof on Amazon in the first two weeks of March following panic buying as concerns over coronavirus grow. Sales for a specific27-pack of 1,000-sheet toilet paper were up 944% compared to the same period in 2019, according to Guru Hariharan, CEO of CommerceIQ which helps brands sell on Amazon. Meanwhile sales of many packaged goods, including cereal, aspirin, and batteries, more than doubled compared to a year ago. However, according to Amazon workers, demand has surged but staffing in some locations is down as much as half as some workers have also been staying home to avoid infection. This surge in demand has prompted Amazon to make plans to hire 100,000 more staff, according to BuzzFeed. But there are also fears that the response could create an internal public health problem as people are urged to practise social distancing. Amazon's surge in sales comes as online food deliveries in the UK are booked in to April as supermarkets warn they cannot 'feed the nation' alone and encourage families to help those in self-isolation. It comes as elderly and vulnerable customers found yesterday that they could have to wait up to April for food and essentials because delivery slots have already been filled up until then. As of Tuesday, Sainsbury's have no delivery slots available before Monday April 6, with Morrisons only a few slots left on April 5. Asda doesn't have slots available until Sunday March 29. Shoppers logging on toOcado on Tuesday morning were told they had an hour's wait. Senior industry leaders told The Telegraphthat UK stores would 'neverhave enough' resources to reach every self-isolated person in Britain and encouraged people to help the vulnerable with their shopping. It comes as the Nationwide Building Society and several supermarkets offer opening times for elderly shoppers only, in an attempt tostem the coronavirus crisis. Yet, the government has now advised over-70s to self-isolate for three months and as such they will be unable to take advantage of the 'silver hour'. Asenior industry source told the publication: 'The reality is that neighbours and community groups will have to step in to deliver food. There's no other way of doing it. 'We're confident we'll have enough supplies, but getting them to the right people is an entirely different matter.' Another source urged customers not to use desired delivery slots if they were physically able to shop in person. Supermarkets confessedunprecedented demand had caused delays, whilethe online store Ocado began cancelling orders. Elisabeth Bennett, a wheelchairbound carer for her 95-year-old father, said yesterday that her next Sainsbury's order would arrive mid-April at the earliest. 'We are told not to stockpile, that there will be more supplies, then they cut us out,' she said. 'Normally, you can get a slot the next day, so three weeks or more is a huge problem.' It comes after a chaotic weekend for supermarkets, which saw their shelves emptied of essential items such as toilet rolls, cleaning products, dried pasta and tinned food, after the virus outbreak was classified as a pandemic. Supermarkets have urged customers not to panic buy to ensure everyone is adequately supplied. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said staff have been the victims of abuse in recent days, but retailers are working with the police to keep stores â€˜running as smoothly as possibleâ€™. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said: â€˜Even when circumstances are difficult, retailers are well versed in providing effective security measures.â€™ Sainsbury's - which has a five-product limit on certain items - emailed millions of its customers to urge them not to stockpile and insisting there were enough supplies of food and essential items for 'everyone'. Chief executive Mike Coupe wrote: 'There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked.' He continued to urge families to stop hoarding products and added: 'Please think before you buy and only buy what you and your family need.' Meanwhile, Nationwide Building Society is also trialling new branch opening times during the coronavirus outbreak so that elderly and vulnerable people can manage their money in a safe environment within a dedicated hour each morning. From Wednesday March 18, more than 100 branches across the UK will open from 8am, instead of the usual 9am, for people aged 70 and above and those with underlying health conditions. Elsewhere, Lidl announced dedicated shopping hours for older customers and those more vulnerable, with all stores boastingprioritised queuing from 9 to 11am every day. On Sunday, an Iceland store in Belfast announced it would reserve an hour each morning for only elderly customers. Iceland told MailOnline that they are allowing their stores to make their own decisions on how best to meet the needs of their local communities, but can't confirm plans for specific branches at the moment. The reserved shopping time at the Kennedy Centre store, West Belfast, is set to start on Tuesday, and has received largely positive support online. Supermarkets are also limiting the amount of essentials per person to help combat panic buying."
34,"Health officials warn that the US does not have enough stockpiled masks, gloves and hospital gowns to tackle the pandemic",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121311/Health-Human-Services-officials-tell-doctors-not-medical-equipment-stockpiled.html,"Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday warned doctors that there was not enough medical equipment, such as face masks, gloves and hospital gowns, to last them through the duration of the coronavirus crisis, it's been reported. Representatives from HHS held a conference call with medical professionals on Monday to discuss the Strategic National Stockpile - the nation's largest supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency. As CNN first reported, citing an unnamed source who was on the call, government officials conceded that there was not enough protective gear to supplement dwindling supplies on the local and state levels in the face of exploding demand. Scroll down for video As of early Tuesday morning, there were 4,993 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and 93 deaths. Multiple states across the US this week began shutting down bars, restaurants, movie theaters and gymsto prevent large gatherings of people in an effort to stop the spread of the deadly virus. One of the major concerns is that if large numbers of people contract the virus all at once and seek medical attention en mass, it could overwhelm the nation's health care system and deplete crucial medical supplies.  Doctors taking part in Monday's talks reportedly were told the Trump administration did not yet have a solution to the anticipated shortage of vital protective gear, but one was in the works. 'We have been transparent that more supplies are needed -- hence the request to Congress for additional funding so we could procure more and scale up production,' an HHS spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. 'The role at the Federal level is to appropriately implement regulatory relief, provide alternative sources and support manufacturing, and adjust allocation.' The government agency stressed that hospitals have a responsibility to move supplies to area where they are needed 'rather than been store where it is not currently needed.' The Strategic National Stockpile was created in 1999 to prepare for unprecedented emergencies, including terrorist attacks, natural disasters and outbreaks of disease such as Ebola in 2014 and Zika in 2016. Much about the stockpile is shrouded in secrecy for national security reasons, but it is known that there are about $8billion worth of vaccines, medications, antitoxins, personal protective equipment, charged-up ventilators and other supplies, which are all stored under armed guard in giant warehouses scattered around the country. Tara O'Toole,a former homeland security official, told NPR last week that while the stockpile is vast, its purpose is to fill gaps in supply chains, or to respond to sudden spikes in demand, but it is not big enough to meet the needs of every hospital and medical office in the country. 'It's a bridge,' she said. 'It's not a replacement for the private sector.' Steven Adams, acting director of the stockpile program, told the radio station that it currently holds about 30million surgical masks and 12million of the more protective N95 masks. While those numbers may seem high at first glance, Adams said that it is anticipated that about 300million masks a month would be required in the event of a full-scale pandemic. Last week, President Donald Trump issued a memo giving HHS full authority to procure medical supplies through the Strategic National Stockpile and to make sure that there were enough respirators for every patient. Whether accomplishing that goal would require the federal government to team up with the private sector, or invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act to force private companies to accept government contracts remains to be seen. During a press conference on Sunday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar acknowledged the 'unprecedented challenge' the pandemicposes to the US hospital system but wouldn't say how many ventilators the US has on hand, citing 'national security' concerns. He said the administration was working to increase the number of supplies, including ventilators, available to the health industry from the Strategic National Stockpile as it combats the disease. Breathing problems are one of the main symptoms of the coronavirus. 'We have tremendous supplies. But we want to acquire more,' Azar said of the stockpile. 'And that's thanks to the bipartisan work of Congress funding the emergency supplemental that gives us the money to scale up production here and abroad.' 'We don't disclose concrete numbers on particular items for national security purposes,' he added."

During the course of the sermon, the pastor, a South African-born US citizen who first came to the United States as a missionary in 1987, told his followers to greet one another, according to Newsweek. â€˜Well I know they don't want us to do this, but just turn around and greet two, three people,â€™ he said. â€˜Tell them you love them, Jesus loves them.â€™ Florida, as of Monday, has reported four deaths from the novel coronavirus. There have also been 155 confirmed cases of coronavirus reported in the state - a significant spike compared to figures over the weekend. Some cities and counties have begun implementing bans on gatherings of more than 250 people. But Howard-Browne doesnâ€™t appear eager to heed any that might affect his church. â€˜Listen, this has to be the safest place,â€™ he said during the sermon. â€˜If you cannot be saved in church, you in serious trouble.â€™ Last month, Howard-Browne bragged that he had plans to stop the coronavirus. He said he would do to the pathogen what he did with the Zika virus, which was â€˜cursedâ€™ from Florida in the name of Jesus. Howard-Browne pledged to ward off coronavirus and keep it from reaching the United States. â€˜We are doing the same thing with the coronavirus,â€™ Howard-Browne said in a Periscope video posted on February 24. â€˜We do not need it on these shores, and somebody said â€œWell, what about the rest of the world?â€ â€˜I mean, I can't be responsible for every city, or whatever.â€™ As of Monday afternoon, the US has reported more than 4,100 confirmed cases of coronavirus. At least 73 people who were confirmed carriers of the virus have died. Howard-Browne is known for making outlandish statements. In January, he made headlines when he said that Jesus should â€˜beat the crap out ofâ€™ John Bolton, the former national security adviser who was critical of President Trump after he fired him over disagreements on foreign policy. He also led a prayer circle alongside his wife Adonica in the White House in 2017. Howard-Browne was part of a group invited to pray with Trump during a meeting with members of The Office of Public Liaison. Howard-Browne, who is from South Africa but came to America in 1987 after a 'calling from God', described the moment as 'surreal' and 'humbling'. He wrote: 'I was asked by Pastor Paula White-Cain to pray over our 45th President - what a humbling moment standing in the Oval Office - laying hands and praying for our President - Supernatural Wisdom, Guidance and Protection - who could ever even imagine - wow - we are going to see another great spiritual awakening. Howard-Browne's teachings on the concept of 'holy laughter' - an outpouring of joy caused by the Holy Spirit - helped to inspire the Toronto Blessing, which many believe to be an instance of mass blessing which took place in 1994.

36,"Doomsday 'preppers' reveal plans to survive coronavirus at $1,000-a-year West Virginia ranch complete with bunk beds, concrete bunkers, gun store, a ditch where contaminated bodies can be incinerated and enough food and toilet paper for 25 years",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120633/Stunning-photos-reveal-1-000-year-survivalist-camp-America.html,"Doomsday 'preppers' have revealed their plans to survive coronavirus, by staying at a camp complete with concrete bunkers, a gun store, solar panels and a ditch where contaminated bodies can be incinerated. The Fortitude Camp in West Virginia, two hours outside the capital Washington, will go into lockdown when its committee-of-five vote to declare a 'catastrophic situation', meaning all members will be asked to come to the camp. Access will then only be permitted via a secret password. Survivalists pay $1,000-a-year for a space on one of its 500 bunk beds and access to its stores which the manager claims are filled with enough flour, rice and toilet paper to last the inhabitants for 25 years. The camp, nestled in the Appalachian mountains, also has wells, radio equipment, greenhouses and a farm with chickens, goats and cows. It is protected by four armed lookout posts. 'It's not a bunch of crazy people with this idea that tomorrow the world ends,' said manager and former Operation Desert Storm soldier who participated in the 1991 attack in the Persian Gulf, Steve Rene. 'We're not militaristic. We have no ties with militias, anything like that. If you're not prepared in some way, you have just no where to go, nothing to do. Everybody scrambles and lots of things get out of hand. 'It's like a life insurance policy that actually protects your life, rather than a life insurance policy that pays to bury you.' The camp four lookout points are armed with high-calibre rifles, which are cable of stopping armoured vehicles in their tracks. 'Desperate people do desperate things,' said Mr Rene. The 'survivalists' view their main threat as other Americans rushing to steal their provisions. 'Obviously that's not very likely,' said the former soldier, 'but the possibility exists'. In the case of an epidemic, camp policy dictates that new arrivals temperature will be checked with a no-contact thermometer before they are allowed in. It was founded by a former military intelligence expert and Harvard University graduate, Drew Miller, who has established a separate branch in Colorado and hopes to build more across the US. Since the coronavirus outbreak, Mr Rene said he has been receiving more and more enquiries from worried people across the country. Worried people who already had the idea of survivalism 'at the back of their mind' are now seeing 'there can be a need', said Mr Rene. A laptop open next to him shows an online map displaying the spread of the virus in real time. There are no red dots in the vicinity of the survivalists' ranch. As of Monday, West Virginia was the last state in the country not to have declared any cases of the disease that has shut down so much of the world. Curt La Haise has put up with plenty of razzing from friends over the years who have called him paranoid for stockpiling an eight-month supply of food in his basement and having enough fuel to power his generator for almost an entire winter. They're not laughing anymore amid panic buying that has cleared store shelves across the U.S. and growing fears that the new coronavirus will force many Americans to self-quarantine for weeks in their homes. 'Now my friends are like, 'What should I do, what should I get?' said La Haise, who operates a firearms and safety training business near Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. 'Prepping doesn't look so bad now.' For those in the often-mocked 'prepper' community, this is quickly becoming their 'I told you so' moment. But many are resisting saying that, even if it's in the back of their minds. What they hope is that they'll finally be taken seriously and that more people will follow their lead. 'We're not laughing. We're not saying, 'I told you so,' when people are out there fighting over toilet paper and hand sanitizers,' said Paul Buescher, of Northfield Center Township, Ohio. Buescher is one of 32 members of a group in northeastern Ohio that shares a farm packed with enough canned and dehydrated food and water to last for years. He said he is now getting calls all day long asking for advice. Survival supply stores can't keep up with the demand for food kits and medical supplies. 'Every single business that has to do with emergency preparedness is overloaded,' said John Ramey, founder of a Colorado-based prepper website called The Prepared. Most preppers say they are about self-reliance and common sense and are quick to distance themselves from the 'doomsday preppers' who are depicted on television shows awaiting the day most of the world's population is wiped off the map. 'The vast majority of this is 'beans and Band-Aids,' not 'bullets and bunkers,' Ramey said. Jim Cobb, a disaster readiness consultant and editor-in-chief of Prepper Survival Guide magazine, said he has seen a few fellow preppers gloating on social media about people who are crowding stores in search of disinfectants. 'I hate the thought of alienating any of them because they think were a bunch of elitist goofballs.' he said. 'We're trying to take advantage of the opportunity that for once they're not laughing and pointing fingers at us.' While most people who have tested positive for the virus experience only mild or moderate symptoms, there's a greater danger and longer recovery period for older adults and people with existing health problems. Experts say it's most important to practice safe hygiene: Wash hands frequently, cover sneezes and coughs, and stay home if fever or other symptoms arise. As for the preppers, they have their own recommendations for anyone who is unsure of what to do next: "

There could be 'no tourists left' within a matter of days as500 hotels in the Costa Del Sol are expected shut. Coronavirus cases have increased despite an unprecedented national lockdown, in which residents and tourists alike were banned from going outside except to buy food, go to work, or get medical help for 15 days. Around 12,000 people could lose their jobs in the Andalusia region - which includes the Costa Del Sol - alone as a result of hotel closures. The move is being described as 'unavoidable' following Spain's declaration of a State of Emergency. Under guidelines to slow the spread of the bug, Spanish authorities set uppolice checks at its land borders with France and Portugal and turned back foreigners attempting to enter. Only Spaniards, permanent residents and trans-border workers are able to enter. Trade in goods is not affected. Cars queued to get into Spain at Vilar Formoso in Portugal as Spanish police wearing protective face masks and latex gloves checked identities and turned back vehicles carrying passengers without permission to enter. Joaquim Silva, from Portugal, wanted to drive through Spain to get back to France, where he has lived for more than 50 years. He said: 'It's terrible because we live there (in France), we have family there, we have health problems that are being treated there. 'Here in Portugal we do not even have a family doctor.' Spain plans to pay benefits to workers temporarily laid off, part of measures to mitigate the economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic, according to a government draft document. It is also considering ordering mortgage suspensions for those whose employment has been affected by the outbreak, a source said. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards have been sent home temporarily from companies such as Volkswagen and Burger King since the outbreak. More than half of jobs in Spain are dependent on small or medium-sized companies in a country with one of the developed world's highest unemployment rates. Raquel Las Heras, who runs a booth selling lottery tickets in Albacete, in south-east Spain said: 'I have a little saved up, but I have absolutely zero income at the moment. 'If I stay home like this, I reckon I can last about two months.' The Balearic Islands - which include Mallorca and Ibiza - closed its air space to visitors. A Foreign Office spokesperson said repatriation flights are not being arranged to bring Britons home at this time. Airlines have dramatically reduced the number of flights to Spain because of the crisis. President of the Federation of Hotel Businesses of Andalusia, Luis CallejÃ³n SuÃ±Ã© said the 44 hotels already closed are 'only the tip of the iceberg',Spanish newspaperSur.es reports. Most of the rest of the hotels along the Costa del Sol are expected to close between now and the weekend. These offer 78,000 beds and provide employment for 12,000 workers. Thousands of hostels and apartment buildings are also expected to follow. No dates have been announced for reopening but the closures will last until at least the summer. Some of the hotels have offered their facilities as make-shift hospitals if needed. The news follows yesterday's announcement that hotels across Benidorm, the Costa Blanca and Valencia are also closing by Thursday on a voluntary basis in a bid to safeguard staff and tourists from the coronavirus outbreak. And the Canary Islands are also expect to have 'zero tourists' within the next week after new measures limited the influx of people to the archipelago. The Balearic Islands - which include Mallorca and Ibiza - are experiencing the same scenario with hotels closed and many chains also offering their rooms for patients if necessary. The hotel association for the Costa Blanca has announced that hotels have taken the decision to 'self regulate' in the absence of an official order from the Spanish Government. A statement issued by the association confirmed: 'We would have liked the closure to have been decreed by order of the Government, as has happened in other countries but in the absence of a political decision hotel businessmen have decided to self-regulate ourselves in the application of the reasonableness and responsibility in these grave moments. 'Thus, hundreds of companies have already decided to close and many others are joining this measure as an urgent need to control the health crisis that is causing a serious economic crisis. 'Hotel and vacation activity is clearly incompatible with the measures decreed by the Central Government to confine the population to their homes and to keep hotels open we cannot guarantee the necessary isolation conditions to control the coronavirus pandemic.' 'This decision has been communicated to the tourist authorities of the Valencian Community, to the Presidency of the Generalitat and to the mayors of the main City Councils for their knowledge.' He added: 'We have also proceeded to communicate this closure to the tour operators, travel agents and now it is time to start the procedure as soon as possible so that all the clients staying end their stay as soon as possible.' 'This period is more than reasonable, especially if we take into account that the state of alarm was declared last Friday, which means that there will have been a period of almost a week to proceed with the repatriation and return to their places of origin of all tourists.' 'This orderly closure must be done always taking into account inexcusable compliance criteria such as the safety of our staff, the fundamental rights of hygiene, health and nutrition of the clients and the obligatory need to avoid contagion within the establishments.' Guests in hotels are being advised to make contact with their tour operators."
39,"China lectures the world on coronavirus: State media says other countries should learn from Beijing's principles of early detection, quarantine and treatmentÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120753/World-learn-lessons-China-coronavirus-fight-state-media-says.html,"The rest of the world should learn from China and follow the principles of early detection, early quarantine and early treatment in order to halt the global spread of the coronavirus, the official China Daily said on Tuesday. Though the coronavirus was first discovered last year in the city of Wuhan, where officials initially tried to cover up the outbreak, China has sought to emphasise the positive role it has played in controlling the global spread of the disease. With the number of new domestic cases dwindling, China has now turned its attention to controlling new infections coming into the country from overseas, where the pandemic continues to spread. China Daily said Singapore, Japan and South Korea had all 'based their responses on the experience and lessons drawn from China's successful battle with the virus', and China was now 'proactively sharing' its best practices. But not all countries are paying attention, increasing the possibility that the epidemic will get worse, the newspaper said. '(D)espite the unmistakable seriousness of the situation, some countries have tried to play down the risks, and the measures they have taken are not only insufficient to control the pandemic at home, but also not enough to prevent themselves from being the source of virus transmission to other countries,' it said. It said 'the drastically worsening situations' in some countries showed the importance of targeted measures to improve quarantine and treatment, and they should also strengthen communication and cooperation to better coordinate their efforts. Chinese President Xi Jinping told United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week that China's efforts to control the outbreak had given the world 'precious time' to formulate their own responses. China and the United States have been in a war of words about the pandemic, with many senior U.S. government officials, including President Donald Trump, continuing to refer to COVID-19 as the 'Chinese virus'. Top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday that attempts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China's efforts to curb the coronavirus would not succeed, and could lead to retaliation. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."

The Seattle-based company also said workers on at least $15, including those in warehouses and delivery centres, will receive a $2 an hour wage rise until the end of April. This will also apply to those in the UK and the European Union. The digital marketplace, which has already run out of many cleaning supplies, has warned shoppers that orders may take longer than two days to deliver. 'We are seeing a significant increase in demand, which means our labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year,' Amazon's warehouse and delivery network manager, Dave Clark, said in New York yesterday. Last week, Amazon tweaked to its time-off policy for hourly workers, telling them they could take as much time off as they wanted in March, although they would only be paid if they had earned time off. Additionally, Amazon said it would pay hourly workers for up to two weeks if they contracted the virus or needed to be quarantined. The Seattle-based company said the new job openings are for a mix of full-time and part-time positions and include delivery drivers and warehouse workers, who pack and ship orders to shoppers. Amazon is already the second-largest U.S.-based employer behind Walmart, with nearly 800,000 workers worldwide."
41,'I walked out yesterday into a very different world': Jared Leto had NO IDEA about the coronavirus pandemic after spending 12 days on silent meditation desert trip with no phone,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8120249/Jared-Leto-NO-IDEA-coronavirus-pandemic-spending-12-days-desert-no-phone.html,"Jared Leto has been left stunned after emerging from a12-day desert retreat to discover the spread of coronavirus has now become a global pandemic. The 48-year-old Oscar winner was shocked to learn that much of the world was taking extreme measures to fight COVID-19, with countless people self-isolating at home. The Hollywood star shared his thoughts on social media shortly after being reunited with his smartphone. Jared shared a tweet thread with his shock upon rejoining the world, as well as an identical text post shared to Instagram. â€˜Wow. 12 days ago I began a silent meditation in the desert. We were totally isolated. No phone, no communication etc. We had no idea what was happening outside the facility,â€™ he began. â€˜Walked out yesterday into a very different world. One thatâ€™s been changed forever. Mind blowing - to say the least. Iâ€™m getting messages from friends and family all around the globe and catching up on whatâ€™s going on. The 30 Seconds to Mars frontman ended his thread with some simple words of advice. â€˜Hope you and yours are ok. Sending positive energy to all. Stay inside. Stay safe,â€™ he wrote. Jaredâ€™s 4.3 million Twitter followers wouldnâ€™t have known that he was incommunicado, as he had multiple tweets scheduled to post while he was silently meditating. Since he left, multiple major American cities have canceled or recommended canceling most crowded social and entertainment events, and many people have been practicing social distancing in order to limit the spread of the coronavirus. It doesnâ€™t seem to have affected the Blade Runner 2049 starâ€™s music - yet. His next performance with his long-running band is a four-day festival in Croatia in August featuring two performances, though itâ€™s still unclear if the global pandemic could affect dates that far away. The opulent single-band festival will set attendees back anywhere from $1,649 plus fees for a three-day pass to $7,149 plus fees for a four-day all inclusive VIP package. What is the coronavirus?

42,Trump's former White House physician heaps praise on the president's 'quick actions' over coronavirus and claims 'he has prevented the US becoming like Italy',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121233/Donald-Trumps-former-doctor-heaps-praise-coronavirus-response.html,"Donald Trump's former White House physician has heaped praise on his response to the coronavirus outbreak - saying his 'quick action' has prevented the US from becoming an infection hotspot like Italy or Iran. Ronny Jackson, who was accused of lying over Trump's height and weight during a physical in 2018, said the President 'has done everything he needed to do.' Speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News, Jackson said: 'He put together a top-notch team and he was criticized.... despite that, he carried on and did what he needed to do for our country.' Among measures that Jackson praised was the ban on some travelers coming from China to the US that Trump put in place on January 31. Trump also banned travelers from Europe coming to the US last week, though experts warned it woud have little effect since the disease is already spreading person-to-person within America's borders. 'What's going on in Italy and Iran is not going to happen here I think, because of the president's quick and decisive actions. I think we are going to be more in line with what's going on in South Korea,' he added. 'We are going to see that we got on it early ... the president stopped it quickly and it's going to save countless American lives.' South Korea, with 8,200 confirmed infections and 81 deaths, had the worst outbreak of coronavirus anywhere in the world until it was overtaken by Italy last week. The US already has 86 deaths from the virus amid widespread warnings that health authorities are under-estimating the number of infections at 4,600 because of problems with testing. South Korea has been widely praised for one of the world's most-efficient testing regimes with up to 10,000 tests performed per day. The US, meanwhile, has managed to test some 50,000 people since the outbreak began last month. The Trump administration has been widely-criticized for its slow response to the pandemic, with Trump dismissing coronavirus as being similar to the flu and a 'Democrat hoax' only weeks ago. However, that has rapidly changed in the last few days as the White House urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people on Monday and called for bars, restaurants, and other public venues to close. Trump refrained from ordering sweeping public quarantines, lockdowns or curfews for the time being, even as some state and local authorities independently imposed mandatory restrictions. 'We're recommending things,' Trump told a White House news conference in issuing new coronavirus guidelines. 'We haven't gone to that step yet' of ordering a lockdown. 'That could happen, but we haven't gone there yet.' Trump also said he felt that postponements of primary elections, like those announced in Ohio, Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, were generally unnecessary. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said on Twitter his administration was ordering polls closed on Tuesday in defiance of a state court ruling to the contrary. The number of known coronavirus infections and deaths in the United States has paled in comparison with hot spots of the global pandemic, such as China, Italy or Iran. But the tally of confirmed U.S. cases has multiplied quickly over the past few weeks, surpassing 4,600 and prompting fears American hospitals might soon be overwhelmed, as Italian medical centers have been strained to the breaking point. At least 83 people in the United States had died of the virus, as of Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University and public health agencies, with the hardest-hit state, Washington, accounting for the bulk of the fatalities, including six more announced on Monday. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said health officials were relying on members of the millennial generation - those in their 20s to 40s, and representing the largest living adult cohort - to alter their social behavior for the good of the public. Millennials, she said, are 'the ones that are out and about, and they're the most likely to be in social gatherings, and they're the most likely to be the least symptomatic' even if they are unwittingly infected and contagious, Birx told the briefing. Release of the latest 15-day plan for slowing the spread of the virus came as state and local government officials pleaded with the Trump administration to mount a coordinated response to the pandemic, as millions of workers and students were already hunkering down at home. Besides recommendations to limit the size of gatherings and shut down public places in states where community spread of the virus is evident, Birx said one of the most important measures was for people who are sick to stay home. 'If everybody in America does what we ask for over the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference,' Birx said. The guidelines also call for entire households to self-quarantine even if just one family member is diagnosed. The unprecedented wave of closures and restrictions, which began to accelerate last week, took on fresh urgency as New Jersey 'strongly discouraged' all non-essential and non-emergency travel between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m., starting on Monday. The states of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut struck a regional agreement to close all movie theaters, casinos and gyms as of 8 p.m. Monday (0000 GMT). Restaurants and bars in the three states - where more than 22 million people live - will serve takeout and delivery only. Officials in six San Francisco Bay Area counties on Monday ordered residents to stay at home for all but the most crucial outings until April 7. That directive came a day after California Governor Gavin Newsom urged adults older than 65, and their caretakers, to remain indoors whether or not they have underlying health conditions. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said efforts by state and local governments were insufficient to confront the coast-to-coast crisis. 'This is a national problem. It cannot be done in a piecemeal method,' Cuomo said, calling for bold action involving the military and Army Corps of Engineers to quickly create excess hospital capacity. In the nation's capital, Washington, a deeply divided Senate was considering a multibillion-dollar emergency spending bill requiring sick leave for some workers and expanded unemployment compensation, while the Supreme Court postponed oral arguments for the first time in over a century. Washington's mayor also announced restrictions on businesses, including curbs on bars and restaurants, in response to the outbreak. Some 64,000 schools were closed in at least 33 states, including in the nation's two biggest school systems - New York City and Los Angeles. School closures nationwide were disrupting instruction for at least 32.5 million students, according to Education Week. State restrictions on restaurants and places of leisure, while in line with expert advice to slow the spread of the virus through 'social distancing,' will hit many lower-paid workers in the service industry. Jessica Wilmot, owner of the Ancient Mariner pub in Ridgefield, Connecticut, said that while she felt closing shops was the right move, she worried about her mostly part-time staff who work paycheck to paycheck. 'Personally, I'm all for containment,' said Wilmot, noting that her revenues had already fallen about 40% last week from the prior week. 'But my business view is, I'm nauseous.' As traders on Wall Street reacted to drastic weekend measures from the Federal Reserve to stave off a global recession, U.S. stock markets plunged anew on Monday with the S&P 500 closing down 12%. Major airlines sought a U.S. government bailout of more than $50 billion as the White House drafted a financial assistance package following the steep falloff in U.S. travel demand. 'We have to back the airlines,' Trump said on Monday. 'It's not their fault.' Separately, U.S. airports are seeking $10 billion in government assistance. Trump, a Republican, declared a national emergency on Friday and has championed the U.S. government's response, saying his administration has done a 'a very fantastic job.' Democratic leaders have criticized him for playing down the crisis and issuing misleading or false statements. "

Aldo Gonzalez, from Las Vegas, who was filmed as he squirted shoppers on the food aisle, said he was making a video to make him 'famous through Instagram and YouTube'. He has been charged with two counts of felony for dispersing a hoax substance and burglary. It comes at a time of heightened public fear over coronavirus, which has seen whole countries go into lockdown and schools and businesses shut. Sakisat Raylyn, who was in the store, said that when she approached him to ask what he was doing he sprayed her hands, reports the Review Journal. Customers raced out the store when the incident happened at 8pm on Saturday, and noted down the number-plate of the getaway car, a grey Ford sedan. Police were called and arrested Gonzalez at his home. They also interviewed his friend that took the film. When they spoke to the friend, he told them Gonzalez 'wants to be famous through Instagram and YouTube by making funny videos,' according to the police report. The friend also said Gonzalez wore a 'white painterâ€™s suit instead of an actual hazmat suit because an actual hazmat suit would be too serious'. He is said to have added that Gonzalez had put water in an empty bottle of Fabulous cleaner. The Walmart, on Rainbow Boulevard, was evacuated and remained closed for several hours while officers inspected the substance, before declaring it harmless. In their report, officers say: 'Due to the suspect's actions and mode of dress, especially in the current environment of the coronavirus pandemic, he caused alarm in the store among the employees and customers.' The clear liquid was inspected and declared harmless after it was found to have a neutral PH, and no chemicals, proteins or bio-organisms. Gonzalez had told police that he was only spraying water. No one sprayed developed any symptoms and no one went to hospital."
44,"Try to have five portions of FUN a day: It's natural to be fearful in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak - but being afraid actually lowers your immune system. Here, doctor and comedian PHIL HAMMOND gives his prescriptionÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8119603/PHIL-HAMMOND-gives-prescription-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html,"Are you panic-buying anything you can get your hands on? If so, it's likely that you are either afraid or trying to stop yourself being afraid. But if you get yourself into a sweaty scrum in the dry goods aisle, it's the perfect way to spread the virus, which is counter-productive. Fear is contagious, so we need a strategy to counter it. A wise older woman in a hospice taught me a huge lesson when I was a medical student. She said 'the fear of cancer can be worse than cancer'. This wasn't to trivialise the seriousness of her predicament, and all the information she needed was given to her honestly and openly, but she wasn't fearful. Her hospice had a daily drinks trolley, served ice-cream, allowed her pets to visit and did singalongs. Her pain was well-controlled. 'I just try to have five portions of fun a day,' she said, before asking me politely to leave before the hairdresser arrived. Patients never cease to amaze me in their resilience. I work as part of an NHS team specialising in post-viral fatigue â€” and I expect to see a spike in patients when all this has gone away. My patients are often young people with severe fatigue. Previously they were leading fit, active, happy lives, absolutely bursting with energy. As one of them said to me: 'It's like I used to have a Duracell battery and now I've got a Poundland battery.' Some are able to attend school or college part-time but some are housebound, self-isolating and missing out on what should be a really exciting time in their lives. The most common trigger we see for this fatigue is a viral infection, such as the Epstein-Barr virus that causes glandular fever. We don't fully understand why some people make a complete recovery from their infection, others suffer post-viral fatigue for up to three months and some suffer for much longer, giving them a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. Genes will play a part, but so does environment. We can't separate our seed from our soil. Some research has found that if people are anxious and fearful when they contract a virus, it can make the symptoms worse and increases their risk of post-viral fatigue. We think stress, anxiety and fear can damage the immune system and make it more likely you will crash your battery. Most of us carry antibodies to various herpes viruses, but only some of us get shingles or cold sores. Again, fear and stress seem to play a role. People often say they get outbreaks when they are stressed, overworked or sleeping badly. There is clearly a delicate balance between appropriate concern and fear â€” and we need to get that right, because we know that the inextricable link between mind and body and environment means we could end up doing a lot of psychological harm in addition to the physical consequences. There are no treatments yet for Covid-19, so fear levels are high. Constructive communication from our politicians is paramount. Our wisest of health secretaries, Nye Bevan, understood the need for a National Health Service because he came from a mining community where people lived not just in fear of illness or the trauma of pit accidents and war, but the fear of not being able to afford medical treatment and pain relief. He called his autobiography In Place Of Fear, perfectly capturing the public mood. Churchill, too, was a master of communication. 'We shall fight on the beaches' sounds far more reassuring than 'we will lose thousands on the beaches'. Fear itself damages your immune system, but it is possible to stop that happening. The best advice I know comes from Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modelling. His advice is that to counter the fear of catching coronavirus, we should all behave as if we have it already. It isn't troubling us too much but we could spread it to others more vulnerable and must behave accordingly. Handwashing and social distancing remain absolutely vital. Beyond that, we need to get on with enjoying our wild and precious life. Harley Street psychologist Dr Meg Arroll offers advice... Anxiety and fear tend to be worse when the brain has the space to be scared. Negative emotions are often triggered by negative thoughts (and vice versa), and talking therapies can teach you to challenge them. As Churchill observed: 'I'm an old man, I've had many worries, most of them never happened.' Your brain can only hold so much information at one time, and if you fill it with scary news it's very hard not to be anxious and fearful, as your body feels under constant threat and your mind runs riot. So we need to fill it with something healthier. As well as eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, I tell my patients to be like the wise lady in the hospice and try to have five portions of fun a day. That big holiday you had planned may well be cancelled and your sports teams have been told to stop playing. But now is the time to learn to relish the little things. The damp snout of a dog against your thigh (they don't get coronavirus). A dewy cobweb. The spring flowers. Learning to strum a guitar, paint, knit, cook or finish the crossword. Pottering around the garden. Laughing with friends and family. Love and laughter are the greatest cure for fear. If you can't manage five portions of fun, start with one. I also recommend what I call the daily pillars of health. These are your CLANGERS. Connect, Learn, be Active, Notice, Give back, Eat well, Relax, Sleep. Your CLANGERS may be very different from mine, and the CLANGERS we do when we're well and free to roam are different from the ones we do when we're sick or self-isolating. But they are nonetheless vital. And think of your friends and family as soft-toy CLANGERS, a kind, close-knit group who live a gentle existence on our Blue Planet, on a diet of home-made soup and blue string pudding. They dropped the occasional clanger too, as we will doubtless do in the fight against coronavirus, but they owned up and learned from it. Coronavirus may be nature's way of telling us to slow down, support each other in local communities and live in the moment, day by day, with enough energy put by for those five small portions of fun; the little things that give us joy, purpose and meaning in our lives. If we do this every day, and have gratitude for it, we may yet emerge stronger from our temporary battery confinement into a gentler free-range existence.

45,'We don't have anything!' Las Vegas gun shop owner tells customers to stay away after his shelves were stripped by panic-buyers amid coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120721/Las-Vegas-gun-store-runs-weapons-ammo-panic-buying.html,"A Las Vegas gun-shop owner has urged people to stop trying to buy weapons and ammunition for at least two days because he has nothing left to sell. Brandon Burns, who owns Spartan Arms & Range Supplies, filmed himself in his store Monday in front of shelves that typically house rifles, shotguns, handguns and ammo - all of which have been stripped bare by panic-buyers. 'Listen folks, do us a favor OK? Tomorrow, don't blow our phones up, I don't have anything,' he tells viewers. 'No handguns, no rifles, no ammunition, no 9mm, no 40mm, no .45, no 5.56, no .22, no twelve-gauge, no twenty-gauge, we don't have it right now. 'We are gunna get it in the next two or three days though, so try to help our staff out and not blow our phones up asking if we have stuff because we just don't, OK? 'Things are not normal right now.' It comes after states including California, New York and Washington - the worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic - reported soaring sales at the weekend. Pictures taken across the country showed lines snaking out of gun stores and down the street as people attemped to protect themselves amid fears of riots and looting if the situation spirals out of control. Others feared that the government's emergency powers could restrict their right to buy a gun while some Asian-Americans bought weapons to protect themselves from potential racist attacks. It comes as thousands of Americans flocked to supermarkets to stockpile essential goods as panic about the coronavirus, which haskilled 69 and infected 3,774 in the US alone, takes hold. Huge lines stretched along the sidewalk outside theMartin B. Retting gun store in Culver City,California. Another stretch of shoppers was seen outside Gun World inBurbank. US correspondent for Australian network Nine News Amelia Adams tweeted: 'Queues to buy guns in LA. Buyers tell me theyâ€™re scared of what will happen if people run out of food and supplies, and they need to protect their families.' John Gore, 39, who lined up outside the Martin B. Retting store on Saturday, told the LA Times: â€˜Politicians and anti-gun people have been telling us for the longest time that we donâ€™t need guns. 'But right now, a lot of people are truly scared, and they can make that decision themselves.â€™ Anna - who had never bought a gun before - said: 'Itâ€™s not like an active panic, more a preoccupation with making sure everyone is adequately prepared, myself and family and friends. 'Better to be prepared and not need it than need it and not have it.' Ralph Charette, 71, spent $1,500 at a store in Germantown, Wisconsin and told USA Today: 'There's so much uncertainty and paranoia but you've got to protect your own.' Gun sales also soared in San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles, as Asian-Americans feared they could be victims of racist attacks due to coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China. Arcadia Firearm & Safety David Liu told CBSNthat many are fearing for their safety should people in their local area catch the bug. Online ammunition storeAmmo.com said there has been a68 per cent increase in sales from February 23 - when Italy's major outbreak was first reported. Donald Trump urged Americans not to stockpile food and told citizens to 'take it easy' on Sunday. Vice President Mike Pence also insisted that food stores will stay open indefinitely. Trump also insisted the outbreak is under 'tremendous control'. The president said the federal, state and local governments are all working with these retail leaders, including Walmart, Costco, Target, Whole Foods, Publix and several more, to ensure there are no shortages of goods and food."
46,"'I just reacted and I'm sorry. It's below me.' Listen as Amber Heard admits to smashing a door into Johnny Depp's head before 'clocking' him in the jaw, in explosive audio tape confession",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8118671/Amber-Heard-admits-smashing-door-Johnny-Depps-head-clocking-jaw.html,"Amber Heard admits to smashing a door into Johnny Depp's head before 'clocking' him in the jaw in the latest bombshell in a series of explosive audio recordings obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com. The shocking tape suggests the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, 56, was hit so hard by the bathroom door that it knocked him off his feet. 'I then stood up, I don't even know if I said, I mean, I might've said like, what the f**k, you know, whatever. Cause I'd just been hit in the head with a f**king corner of the door,' Depp protests. 'And then I stood up and then you f**king clock me.' Heard claims she didn't mean to slam the door into Depp's face - but says of the punch to her then-husband's jaw: 'I just reacted and I'm sorry. It's below me.' The shocking audio has never been aired publicly, but Depp's lawyers played it out loud to the 33-year-old actress while she was giving a deposition in their bitter 2016 divorce case. She told his attorneys that the taped conversation 'misrepresents what actually happened,' disputing whether it was a punch or a push, before adding: 'I mean, he was just very dramatic about everything.' February 3, 2015 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard marry in a private civil ceremony at their LA home, four years after they met as co-stars on the set of The Rum Diary. They celebrate with a lavish reception on a private island in the Bahamas that Depp bought in 2004 for $3.6 million. April 21, 2015 Heard breaches Australia's biosecurity laws after she and Depp fail to declare their two Yorkshire Terriers when they arrive on a private jet for the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Charges of illegally importing animals are dropped but Heard admits falsifying quarantine documents and is placed on a $1k one month good behavior bond. May 23, 2016 Heard files for divorce after 15 months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Four days later a judge issues a temporary restraining order against Depp over domestic violence allegations. Pictures of Heard's alleged injuries hit the tabloids but the LAPD finds no evidence of a crime. August 16, 2016 Heard retracts her allegations as she and Depp reach a $7 million divorce settlement. Their marriage was 'intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,' the former actors say in a statement. 'There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm'. December 18, 2018 The Washington Post publishes an op-ed by Heard, an ambassador for women's rights at for the American Civil Liberties Union, urging support for women who suffer domestic violence. 'Two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,' Heard writes. March 1, 2019 Despite not being named in the article, Depp files a $50 million defamation suit in Fairfax Circuit Court, Virginia saying it insinuated he was an abuser and got him fired from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Depp dismisses Heard's allegations as a 'hoax' and claims he was actually the victim of her violence. April 10, 2019 Heard files a motion to dismiss the complaint, cataloging more than a dozen instances of abuse between 2012, when she moved in with Depp, and the May 2016 bust up that preceded their divorce. She refers to him as 'the monster' in the 300-plus page filing. May 20, 2019 Depp hits back against the motion to dismiss claiming Heard painted bruises on her face, scrubbed metadata and fabricated evidence against him. He denies ever abusing any woman and says of her allegations: 'I will continue to deny them for the rest of my life.' January 31, 2020 #JusticeforJohnnyDepp becomes a top trending hashtag on Twitter after DailyMail.com publishes audio of Heard admitting she hit Depp and threw pots, pans and vases. Online petition urging Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment to ax Heard from the upcoming Aquaman 2 hits 130,000 signatures. Depp's supporters, however, say it is just one of several taped 'confessions' that prove Heard was the domestic abuser in their toxic 18-month marriage - the precise opposite of what she claims. In a previous exchange, published exclusively by DailyMail.com in January, Heard admitted to 'hitting' the Oscar nominee, and pelting him with pots, pans and vases. Weeks later, DailyMail.com published a further clip in which Heard, an ambassador for women's rights and an outspoken domestic violence advocate, taunted Depp for fleeing a violent confrontation, telling him: 'You are such a baby. Grow the f**k up Johnny.' The latest tape emerged today as the warring A-listers prepare to square up again in two separate defamation lawsuits on either side of the Atlantic. On March 23, Depp will take on News Group Newspapers in London over a 2018 article in The Sun newspaper that described him as 'wife beater' and allegedly damaged his standing as a globally famed movie star, with Heard scheduled to give testimony. And, later this year, hostilities will switch to Virginia where Depp has filed a $50 million suit over a Washington Post op-ed in which Heard lamented her experiences as a domestic violence victim, an article that didn't mention her ex by name but allegedly led to him losing his role of Captain Jack Sparrow. It's not known when or where the latest audio was made, however the pair had a habit of recording their arguments, often consensually, as a form of DIY marriage guidance so they could play the tapes back later. 'I opened the bathroom door when you were knocking on it,' Depp begins in the near-three minute clip. 'After a few times I opened and you know, you just kept coming, you just kept going, you just kept going, kept going. 'I tried to close the door three times, you know, please, please, just do you know. 'And then, wait and then, then I, I, I, I accidentally, I swear when I was trying to close the door, I guess it scraped your toes. 'I didn't, you know, I didn't mean to do that. I don't know. I bent down and you either pushed or you kicked. 'I think you kicked the door open. I mean the door. Yeah, more open so that it would hit me and it hit me.' Heard insists that she didn't mean to slam the door into father-of-two Depp - but he protests: 'It hit me in the f**king head.' Heard responds: 'I did not do anything to, I did not kick a door or push a door so that it would hit you. I did not, I swear that I don't even, that did not, it was not my intention. 'I think I remember when the door scraped my toes. I, um, I, I reacted, but this whole, the door thing, I, I remember I never did that. That wasn't on purpose. I might've done it on accident.' Depp is prepared to accept that the door smashing part of his accusation could have been unintentional. But as for the alleged punch: 'I then stood up, I don't even know if I said, I mean, I might've said like, what the f**k, you know, whatever. Cause I'd just been hit in the head with a f**king corner of the door. 'And then I stood up and then you f**king clock me.' Heard replies: 'I remember hitting you as a response to the door thing. And I'm really sorry about hitting you with the door or hitting your head, I did not mean to.' Finally Depp asks: 'You didn't mean to hit me in the head with the door but you meant to punch me in the jaw?' His ex-wife, admits: 'I did mean, I meant to hit you, and I did not do this thing with the door, I do remember, I did mean to hit you.' She adds: 'Okay. I'm sorry I hit you. I didn't mean to hit you but it was in response. I just reacted in response to my foot. I just reacted and I'm sorry. It's below me.' When confronted with the same audio tape during her 2016 divorce disposition, Heard insisted she was the one trapped and on the defensive, not Depp. 'It also misrepresents what actually happened, which is him trying to get into a room,' she said, according to a transcript obtained by DailyMail.com. 'I'm trying to keep him out of, and then he runs the door over my toes trying to get into the room. I tried to push him out of it, which is what the hit is that is referred to. 'And Johnny, whenever he was hit or touched at all, referred to it in these ways of punching or clocked or whatever. 'And whether you discussed it with him or not, the last thing you do in talking to him afterwards or trying to reconcile with him is to get into what the definition of those words mean to him.' Depp and Heard met on the set of The Rum Diary, back in 2011 and married in February 2015. However they split less than two years later when Heard filed for divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp for allegedly beating her up, an accusation he has repeatedly denied. Amid a torrent of headlines and blood-curdling allegations, the pair agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement in August 2016 - which Heard says she donated to charity. However their back-and-forth feud reignited when she wrote in her December 2018 op-ed: 'I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out.' The article didn't mention Depp by name but he sued regardless, arguing he was the victim of an 'elaborate hoax' instigated by Heard to generate positive publicity and advance her career. 'Ms. Heard is not a victim of domestic abuse; she is a perpetrator,' the lawsuit alleges. 'She hit, punched and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body and head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me.' Heard responded with a lurid 300-page filing of her own, cataloging the 'horrific' abuse she claimed to have suffered at Depp's hands, describing him as 'the monster' and recalling many of the allegations she made during their divorce. A spokesman for Heard's legal team said: 'Ms. Heard's testimony is clear that, in the incident described, she was attempting to escape an assault at the hands of Mr. Depp. 'It is unfortunately common for men who have committed domestic abuse to present themselves as the ''victim'' when nothing could be further from the truth.' The case is due to be heard in August. JOHNNY DEPP: Probably just s****y lock. Anyway. AMBER HEARD: I didn't do that. JD: I opened the bathroom door when you were knocking on it.

Yeah, more open so that it would hit me and it hit me. AH: No I didn't mean to, I didn't know that was going to. JD: Wait, wait. It hit me in the f**king head. AH: But I did not mean to do that. I don't know what you're talking about. JD: I was bent down behind the door. AH: I did not do anything to, I did not kick a door or push a door so that it would hit you. I did not, I swear that I don't even, that did not, it was not my intention. I think I remember when the door scraped my toes. I, um, I, I reacted, but this whole, the door thing, I, I remember I never did that. That wasn't on purpose. I might've done it on accident. JD: Okay. So let's say that was an accident. AH: Right. It was. JD: I then stood up, I don't even know if I said, I mean, I might've said like, what the f**k, you know, whatever. Cause I'd just been hit in the head with a f**king corner of the door. AH: I'm so sorry. I did not, I'm sorry. JD: And then I stood up and then you f**king clock me. AH: I remember hitting you as a response to the door thing. And I'm really sorry about hitting you with the door or hitting your head, I did not mean to, nor erm. JD: You didn't mean to hit me in the head with the door but you meant to punch me in the jaw? AH: I did mean, I meant to hit you, and I did not do this thing with the door, I do remember, I did mean to hit you. JD: So that you didn't mean? AH: The door? No, god, no, I didn't. JD: But punching me in the jaw you did? AH: Okay. I'm sorry I hit you. I didn't mean to hit you but it was in response. I just reacted in response to my foot. I just reacted and I'm sorry. It's below me. JD: Your foot. That was why you punched me? AH: Yeah, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry If I...."
47,'I want to kill you with my bare hands': Connecticut man is charged with threatening to murder Adam Schiff,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120423/Connecticut-man-charged-threatening-murder-Adam-Schiff.html,"A Connecticut man has been charged with threatening to murder Adam Schiff after allegedly sending the senior Democratic a threatening message through his schedule-a-meeting website. Robert Phelps, 62, is alleged to have told the congressman forCalifornia's 28th district, 'I want to kill you with my bare hands' and 'you had better hope I never meet up with you'. He signed the message with his name, address, phone number and email. Under the section headed preferred day for the meeting, he is alleged to have written: 'Measure your Coffin day'. Schiff, as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, spearheaded Democrat efforts to impeach Donald Trump and has often found himself the target of Republicans. The sinister message read: 'You little c*********, I want to come and see you so I can spit in your face and I want to kill you with my bare hands and smash your sick little round fat lying face in. 'You had better hope I never meet up with you mother f*****.' It was signed off: 'Robert M. Phelps, Republican'. Under the organisation section, he wrote, 'lyingc***suckerclub,s*****shiffy' and for the names of additional participants section he wrote, 'NANCY PIGLOSI DUMOCRATIC RETARDS'. When he was arrested Phelps admitted sending the email but claimed he 'did not see the message as threatening', reports the Washington Examiner. He also told investigators that he had a right to contact members of congress and defend 'his president'. US Attorney John Durham charged him with threatening to kill House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Phelps was bailed for $25,000 but faces a maximum prison term of 15 years for threatening to assault and murder a US official and for making interstate threats. He sent the message to Mr Schiff in November but was not arrested until March 13."
48,New US Soccer chief disavows her predecessor's 'offensive' legal argument that women's players are less skilled than their male counterparts,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8119955/Parlow-Cone-says-US-Soccer-argument-vs-women-mistake.html,"As a different set of lawyers took over for the US Soccer Federation, new USSF President Cindy Parlow Cone has disavowed papers submitted by the previous attorneys who argued women's national team players had lesser skills and responsibilities than their male counterparts. Parlow Cone took over as head of American soccer's governing body last week when Carlos Cordeiro abruptly resigned because of the backlash over the documents, submitted by the USSF as it defended a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by women's national team players. Seyfarth Shaw had represented the federation since the suit was filed in March 2019. Latham & Watkins replaced it in Monday's night's filing, made simultaneously with a statement by Parlow Cone, a former World Cup and Olympic champion for the US 'Last week's legal filing was an error,' Parlow Cone said. 'It resulted from a fundamental breakdown in our internal process that led to offensive assertions made by the federation that do not represent our core values.' Both sides have moved for summary judgments, asking US District Judge R. Gary Klausner to decide in their favor without a trial, currently scheduled for May 5. They filed final documents associated with those requests late Monday night. Parlow Cone, who had been the federation's vice president since last year, became the first woman president in the USSF's 107-year history. She struck a conciliatory tone. 'The WNT is the most successful soccer team in the world. As it relates to the lawsuit filed by the women, I offer the perspective of a former player. I know how important it is for both the federation and the players to move beyond this and keep working together on what unites us,' she said. 'We only have one federation and one senior women's national team. We have to work together and move forward in a positive manner toward what I know are mutual goals, growing the game and winning.' Players claim they have not been paid equally to the men's national team and asked for more than $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By Alex Raskin, Sports News Editor for MailOnline.com The competing arguments in the US Soccer Federation's wage discrimination debate are clouded by a number of factors, including the differing pay structures between the men's and women's teams, as well as the fact that the men missed the last World Cup while the American women were, again, victorious in 2019. For instance, a US men's player in 2018 would be paid only slightly less than a women's player in 2019, despite the fact that the US men failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, while the US women breezed to victory in France last year. Here are a few things to consider: (Source: Associated Press) The federation's claims in court documents that the women's team didn't have the physical abilities or the same responsibilities as the men's team drew criticism from sponsors, including The Coca-Cola Co. and The Proctor & Gamble Co., as well as MLS Commissioner Don Garber, a USSF board member. The outcry prompted Cordeiro to issue an apology last week while the women's team was playing Japan in the SheBelieves Cup. The women protested by wearing their warmup jerseys inside out before the game - obscuring the US Soccer crest but still showing the four stars symbolizing the team's World Cup victories. 'These assertions are based on pernicious stereotypes, are devoid of any factual support in the record, and are so imbued with discriminatory animus that then-President Carlos Cordeiro apologized for them on behalf of USSF and resigned his post,' lawyers for the players wrote in their filing Monday. 'But his actions do not erase the impact of USSFÂ´s admitted motivations, which demonstrate, as a matter of law, that plaintiffsÂ´ sex was at least `a basis' under the EPA and `a motivating factor' under Title VII for USSFÂ´s pay discrimination.' Players countered US Soccer's claims they are paid less because the FIFA prize money for the men is far greater than the funds for the women. FIFA awarded $400 million for the 2018 menÂ´s World Cup, including $38 million to champion France - the US men failed to qualify. It allocated $30 million for last year's Women's World Cup, including $4 million to the US after the Americans won their second straight title. FIFA has increased the total to $440 million for the 2022 men's World Cup and FIFA President Gianni Infantino has proposed FIFA double the women's prize money to $60 million for 2023. The players maintain that FIFA pays bonuses to national federations, and each makes its own deal with its players. The USSF has said pay for the two teams is structured differently because of distinct collective bargaining agreements. The men's team is paid by appearance and performance, while the women also draw salaries and have benefits. The federation claims the women have been collectively paid $37 million to $21 million for the men's national team over the past five years. The women's team has played in more matches and has been more successful during that time frame, winning consecutive World Cup titles. The men failed to make the field for the 2018 World Cup. 'What equality requires is the same opportunity to earn as much as the men. This opportunity has been repeatedly denied,' said Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the players who sued. 'USSF also returns to its false argument that the women players chose other benefits over equal pay in bargaining. 'The women players sought equal pay and USSF refused. This is also not a defense to an equal pay violation,' she added. 'These are times for unity, not division. USSF should stop trying to change the conversation and just change. Pay women players equally.' Latham & Watkins defended the USSF in a wage discrimination complaint filed by women's players in 2016 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
49,"The cruelest abuse of kindness: A little girl 'fleeing war-torn Afghanistan', a kind-hearted Englishman whose bid to help her inspired Hollywood - and now the shocking twist: it was all a lie concocted by her father with a dark secret",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8119015/The-cruellest-abuse-kindness-little-girl-fleeing-war-torn-Afghanistan.html,"The little girl's plight was enough to melt the hardest of hearts. Four-year-old Bru Ahmadi was living with her father in that squalid refugee camp near Calais known as The Jungle. Home was a small tent made of plastic sheeting draped over a rope strung between two trees. When it rained, the water found its way through gaps in the awning and drenched their pillows and blankets. The only way to stay warm was to add another layer of clothes and hope the next day dawned warmer and drier. Despite the appalling conditions, with her dark eyes, jet-black hair and impish grin, Bru charmed everyone who met her. And one of the camp volunteers who fell under her spell was an eccentric English ex-soldier in a pink Stetson called Rob Lawrie. Her father Reza told him that they had fled rural Afghanistan after the Taliban killed his wife and threatened his own life. Having endured perils and privations crossing two continents, the pair arrived at The Jungle and all Reza wanted now was for someone to take Bru across the Channel so the little girl could have a better life in the UK. Mr Lawrie turned out to be the guardian angel he was looking for. But while he was well meaning, he was also naive. His failed attempt to smuggle the little girl became a cause celebre; an example of personal sacrifice for a good cause. And what a sacrifice: his good name, his marriage, his business, almost his freedom. But now, four years later, Mr Lawrie has found out that very little of Bru's heartbreaking story was true. This 'staggering' discovery comes thanks to a piece of journalistic detective work which is now the subject of a gripping BBC podcast. It tells the story of an extraordinary betrayal of trust on Mr Ahmadi's part â€” not once but twice â€” and with catastrophic consequences for the adults he duped along the way. We must also consider two other younger victims who â€” for the moment, at least â€” remain unaware of the nature and the depth of the wrong done to them. One of them, of course, is Bru. The other is her little sister whom her father abandoned and whose existence he denied. Mr Lawrie's part in this saga dates back to September 2015 when he, like many, was shocked by pictures of the body of the three-year-old Syrian child Alan Kurdi. He had been washed up on the shore of the Mediterranean after his family's disastrous attempt to cross from Turkey to Greece. Mr Lawrie was married with two children and owned his own carpet-cleaning business near Leeds. But he had spent some of his youth in a children's home and was deeply affected by this image of infant vulnerability. He felt he had to do something to help others like Alan. He resolved to use money he had won on the television game show Deal Or No Deal to do so. Packing his company van, he set off for The Jungle. Wearing his trademark lucky Stetson which he had worn on the game show, Mr Lawrie was to visit the chaotic and dangerous camp â€” then home to some 6,000 migrants from 25 countries â€” on a number of occasions. He helped build better accommodation for its refugees and on one such visit met Reza and Bru Ahmadi, then aged four. The story Reza told the credulous Englishman was heart-breaking. The Taliban had forced him off his land and his wife was probably dead. A baby son was being cared for by relatives. Mr Lawrie could see with his own eyes that their current circumstances were little better. The Ahmadis lived in a small tent which leaked. There was no electricity. It did not take much for the Afghan to persuade Mr Lawrie to smuggle them both to England. He said he had distant relatives in Yorkshire who would help them on arrival. But, when the night of the attempt came, it was found there was not enough room for father and daughter to hide in the sleeping compartment above the cab of Mr Lawrie's van. Reza argued that the Englishman should take Bru anyway. He would pay people-smugglers to find him another way later. His relatives in the UK would contact Mr Lawrie and collect Bru. Foolishly you might think, the Englishman agreed. Almost immediately, the plan went wrong. Unbeknown to Mr Lawrie, two Eritrean migrants had hidden themselves in the back of his van and they were detected by police sniffer dogs. Mr Lawrie then told the police about Bru. He was placed under arrest and told he faced people-smuggling charges which carried a maximum five-year prison sentence and a 30,000 euro fine. The court case attracted widespread publicity. To his credit, Reza Ahmadi appeared to plead the Englishman's case. Mr Lawrie was eventually cleared of people-smuggling and given a suspended fine for allowing Bru to travel without a seat-belt. But it wasn't just the rash plan which had unravelled. By then, so had Mr Lawrie's life. Unaware of the risks he had been running, his furious wife left him and his business suffered. Meanwhile, Reza and Bru remained in The Jungle. Their 'saviour' had lost everything for nothing. Or not quite everything. A Hollywood film director had got in touch with him after his arrest. He was interested, he said, in turning the relationship between the Afghan refugee and the English Good Samaritan into a movie. Mr Lawrie wondered whether money made by the film could be used to help Reza and Bru. But they had dropped out of contact after The Jungle was demolished in late 2016. Reza's mobile phone was dead. Then this strange story took another unexpected twist. BBC journalist Sue Mitchell had been present in court for Mr Lawrie's hearing. Afterwards, they stayed in touch. When she was visiting Mr Lawrie's home he received an email which would turn their understanding of events on its head. The email was from a volunteer working with refugees in Denmark. He said he had met a woman called Goli who claimed to be Bru's mother and Reza's wife. She was not dead but desperately searching for her daughter. The woman called Goli had made other bombshell claims. Reza had not fled Afghanistan as a refugee from the Taliban. He had moved to Iran as a child and had been living with Goli, Bru and their new-born daughter Baran in a rented flat in the capital Tehran. There was no baby son. Then, without warning, he disappeared with Bru, then aged three. Not because his life was under threat; he abandoned Goli and Baran simply because he wanted a different, better living in the UK. Relatives already there had done well financially. Mitchell went to Denmark and found Goli. She told her visitor that Reza had been 'furious' when she got pregnant for the second time. After he left, she was forced to stay with his family. He contacted her only once, to say he was in Turkey with Bru. 'I said to Reza, 'Just come back with Bru. Don't destroy everything',' Goli told Mitchell. 'He said, 'I can't have that life in Iran. I just want to go and settle somewhere.' He said he had brought Bru to make it easier for him to get asylum.' Her husband promised her that once he got asylum in the West he would send for her and the baby. In the meantime, she lived a miserable existence with no status among the family of the man who had betrayed her. Eventually, Goli decided she and her younger daughter must follow him to Europe to find Bru. She mostly travelled by foot before crossing the Aegean in a smuggler's dinghy. The boat capsized and she almost lost Baran. Their journey eventually took them to Denmark where they stopped because Baran was sick. They were given a place at an asylum centre and it was there that a translator recognised a picture of Bru on the BBC website. So where were Reza and Bru? At first, the Red Cross confirmed that they were still in Calais. Then came a letter from the organisation saying that father and daughter were thought to have crossed illegally to the UK, whereabouts unknown. The search for them began on social media. Mr Lawrie posted a message on Facebook in which he mentioned the possible Hollywood movie and the money it could make him. Reza took the bait. Mr Lawrie first received a response from someone claiming to be a relative of the Afghan, asking about the money. Then came an anonymous text, to which Mr Lawrie replied, saying that he would give half of the film's proceeds to Bru. Eventually Reza texted 'We must talk'. But he was suspicious. He claimed he was not in the UK. Then that he did not need help. Bru remained out of reach still. Weeks passed before Reza got back in contact. He wanted to meet at a shopping centre in Scotland. The meeting, between Mr Lawrie and Reza eventually took place at a branch of Starbucks. The Afghan was nervous but greeted the Englishman with a smile. And there, with him, was Bru, by then aged seven. She spoke good English and seemed happy. Reza admitted that he 'cut a limited story' to immigration officials â€” presumably the same nonsense he had told Mr Lawrie. But they had granted them both the legal right to remain in the UK. Afterwards, Mitchell sent photographs she had taken of Bru to Goli in Denmark, who was overwhelmed. But still they did not know where the little girl and her father were living. Reza remained very suspicious, but agreed to another meeting. It took place last December. This time Mr Lawrie gave him a teddy bear to give to Bru. What Reza did not know was that secreted inside the soft toy was a tracking device linked to an app. Reza took it. And it led the searchers to a nearby block of flats. Further evidence confirmed that father and daughter were resident. Bru, now eight, had been found. But what to do next? She had spent more than half her life alone with her father. Her mother only had refugee status in Denmark. The Home Office is now investigating Reza Ahmadi's asylum status. He seems to have told a number of people a large number of untruths with hard consequences for all. The future is unclear. Goli, Bru and Baran were finally, briefly, reunited after an SNP MP arranged for Goli and Baran â€” who had refugee status in Denmark â€” to fly to the UK before Christmas. While the two little girls embraced joyfully, it was a bittersweet experience for Goli. After the meeting she told Mitchell: 'Bru was totally unprepared. She doesn't have any background of her mother. She thinks, 'My mother is not alive and I don't have any mother'. 'She tried to come close to me. It was incredible to see her for the first time. 'I can see how much she's grown up, how beautiful she is, how independent she is and so I don't feel too sad. I can forgive something.' And Mr Lawrie? He can forgive Reza Ahmadi â€” now. But learning the truth has been hard. In fact, he said, 'I feel like I've been hit round the back of the head with a cricket bat, it's just staggering.'"
50,"Was it a temple? Was it a pantry? Archaeologists are baffled as to why ancient humans built a massive 'mammoth house' out of thousands of mastodon bones 20,000 years ago",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8117969/Ancient-humans-built-eerie-bone-circle-structures-Mammoth-remains.html,"Ancient ice age humans survived the freezing temperatures by robbing mammoth grave yards and building 'mysterious bone circle structures', a study finds. British scientists examining a site in Russia dated the bones to 20,000 years ago, when Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers lived in the harsh frozen environment. As well as dozens of mammoth bones, reindeer, horse, bear, wolf, red fox and arctic fox bones were also found on the Russian Planes site. About 70 of these structures are known to exist in Ukraine and the west Russian Plain, but this is the oldest discovered. Researchers say the bones were most likely sourced from animal graveyards, and the circle was then hidden by sediment. It is now one foot below current surface level. Scroll down for video A total of 51 lower jaws and 64 individual mammoth skulls were used to construct the walls of the 30ft by 30ft structure and scattered across its interior. For the first time, the archaeologists from the University of Exeter found remains of charred wood and other soft non-woody plant remains within the circular structure near the modern village of Kostenki, about 310 miles south of Moscow. They say this indicates people were burning wood as well as bones for fuel, and the communities who lived there had learned where to forage for edible plants. Dr Alexander Pryor, who led the study, said the Kostenki 11 site represents a rare example of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers living on in this harsh environment. Climate reconstructions indicate at the time summers were short and cool and winters were long and cold, with temperatures around -4 degrees F or colder. The last Ice Age, which swept northern Europe between 75-18,000 years ago, reached its coldest and most severe stage at around 23-18,000 years ago. Most communities left the region, probably because of lack of prey to hunt and plant resources they depended upon for survival, scientists say. 'What might have brought ancient hunter gatherers to this site' in the first place?, Pryor said, while considering the unlikely frozen location. 'One possibility is that the mammoths and humans could have come to thearea en masse because it had a natural spring that would have provided unfrozen liquid water throughout the winter - rare in this period of extreme cold. 'These finds shed new light on the purpose of these mysterious sites. 'Archaeology is showing us more about how our ancestors survived in this desperately cold and hostile environment at the climax of the last Ice Age. 'Most other places at similar latitudes in Europe had been abandoned by this time, but these groups had managed to adapt to find food, shelter and water.' Bone circles were eventually also abandoned as the climate continued to get colder and more inhospitable. Previously, archaeologists have assumed the circular mammoth bone structures were used as dwellings only. The new study suggests this may not always have been the case as the intensity of activity at Kostenki 11 appears less than would be expected from a long term site. Other finds include over 300 tiny stone and flint chips just a few millimetres in size. This is likely debris left behind by the site's inhabitants as they knapped stone nodules into sharp tools with distinctive shapes. They would have been used for tasks such as butchering animals and scraping hides. The research was conducted by academics from the University of Exeter, University of Cambridge, Kostenki State Museum Preserve, University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Southampton. The research has been published in the journalAntiquity. Stone Age hunter gatherers in Britain 11,000 years ago were far more resilient to extreme cold weather than scientists previously thought, according to a recent study. Experts found that a dramatic drop in temperatures, severe enough to halt woodland development, had no substantial impact on human activity at Star Carr. Prehistoric dwellers at the middle Stone Age archaeological site, which dates to around 9,000 BC, persevered through a cold snap that lasted more than 100 years. The study sheds new light on debate surrounding the sensitivity of hunter-gatherer societies to environmental change, suggesting they were hardier than assumed. Researchers at Royal Holloway, University of London, and the University of York examined items found at the site, around 23 miles (37 km) north-east of York. The rich archaeological record gave scientists the rare opportunity to compare the climate record, discovered through analysis of ancient peat taken from core samples, with evidence of human activity. This included worked wood, animal bones, antler headdresses and flint blades, found buried in layers of mud. These artefacts are evidence of the continued productivity and endurance of people at Star Carr throughout the years of extreme cooling, which saw average temperatures drop by more than 3Â°C (5.4Â°F) in the space of a decade. They found pioneering early modern humans who lived at site at the end of the last ice age carried on with life as usual, despite plummeting temperatures. Speaking to MailOnline, researcher Nicky Milner said: 'This was a time before farming, before pottery, before metal. People were living by hunting and gathering for their food 'However, they were still highly skilled and could build houses, had axes to chop down trees and could make boats. 'Despite the climate change, they seem to have carried on living much the same as they had done previously - hunting the same animals and living by the side of the lake, which presumably provided them with various resources.'"
51,Manhunt underway for gunman who shot Mississippi judge in parking lot outside a courthouseÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8117483/Mississippi-judge-shot-critically-wounded-near-courthouse.html," A judge has been shot and critically wounded outside a courthouse in Mississippi, police said. Chancery Judge Charlie Smith was shot Monday morning in the parking lot outside the Lauderdale County Courthouse in downtown Meridian, WTOK-TV reported. Smith was getting out of his truck to go inside the courthouse when the gunfire happened, Meridian Police Lt. Rita Jack said. Investigators had no immediate suspect or description of a vehicle which might have been involved, Jack told The Meridian Star. Police planned to review surveillance video of the area. The judge was taken to a hospital in critical condition with a gunshot wound near his abdomen. Police believe one shot was fired, Jack said. 'We are working with the Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office to get video surveillance and we're hoping to get a break soon in this case,' said Jack. At a meeting later Monday, Chancery Judge Larry Primeaux said Smith had emerged from surgery and was expected to be transferred to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. 'Judge Smith is a decent, fair person and he certainly did not deserve this,' said Primeaux, who has known Smith for decades. 'It's simply a tragedy and it's something we can't tolerate in this society, and we really do need to look at what proper security should be for judges and other personnel at the courthouse in Lauderdale County.' Smith's district includes Lauderdale and Clarke counties. Among subjects that chancery judges in Mississippi handle are divorces, child custody cases, adoptions and guardianships. Smith became a judge in January 2019 after more than 20 years as a youth court and county court prosecutor."

The ACJ320neo is a modified Airbus jet and was unveiled on Monday by Acropolis Aviation. It is far larger than the usual type of luxury jets such as those made by Gulfstream or Bombardier. The $110 million plane comes complete with a master bedroom and en-suite bathroom - said to be the largest ever featured on an Airbus aircraft. There is enough space on board to sleep 17 people and seat 19. Its counterpart, the Airbus A320neo, was only recently unveiled to commercial airlines and was snapped up thanks to its lower operating costs and better fuel efficiency, allowing it to fly up to 6,000 miles on a single tank. It allows for non-stop travel between far flung places such as New York and Tokyo,London and Seattle, or Los Angeles and Auckland. British Airways, Scandinavian Airlines and Lufthansa all operate the plane commercially, but nowit appears the aircraft is ideal for those looking for something different in the private jet sector. The aircraft which is being marketed as an Airbus Corporate Jet uses the same shell as the A320 but has new engines and sharklet wingtips which allow for better fuel consumption and additional range. Acropolis Aviation which is aUK charter operator received the first Airbus ACJ320neo last year at the factory in Toulouse, France. It was then flown to Switzerland to have its ultra-luxurious interior cabin fitted, a process that took 13 months. The cabin has been designed by Yves Pickardt of Alberto Pinto Interior Design. 'We are absolutely delighted with the high quality of workmanship that has gone into the creation of the plane since it arrived green in January 2019,' says Acropolis chief executive Jonathan Bousfield. 'It's something something very special, which will set new standards of comfort and well-being within the VIP charter market, fully utilizing the cabin space.'"
53,Restaurant massacre leaves at least 5 dead including a 12-year-old boy and 21 wounded in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8118281/Restaurant-massacre-leaves-5-dead-12-year-old-boy-21-wounded.html,"Five people were killed and at least 21 others were wounded Saturday when a group of gunmen opened fire inside a restaurant in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. The shooting came a day after the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City issued a travel alert for government personnel visiting Guanajuato for official business. The advisory prohibits U.S. government employees from traveling to the area south of and including Highway 45D, Celaya, Salamanca, and Irapuato. The incident took place at approximately 9:30pm when 10 men got off two trucks, entered the bar in Salamanca and started shooting, Mexican newspaper Excelsior reported. SEE VIDEO BELOW Among the casualties was Leonardo Ortiz, a12-year-old boy, who was on his way out of the restaurant when he and his family got caught in the crossfire. No arrests had been reported as of Monday. His grief stricken father, Juan Francisco Ortiz, shared a heartbreaking video on his Facebook page on Sunday night in which he pleaded for city government officials to release his body. The distraught parent said his family and a former high school classmate, who was also murdered, visited La Tapica for dinner and had just paid their bill. The group stood around a bit longer because the restaurant had lost its electrical power and the system was down. Juan Francisco Ortiz, a former police officer, denied earlier reports that surfaced on social media that the shooting had been the byproduct of a dispute between customers. 'I need contact with the prosecutor, with a senator or the president, if he could contact me, because my municipality here could not help me anymore,' he said. 'The only thing I am asking is that they release the body of my son Leonardo Ortiz GarcÃ­a so that I can cremate him and he can go home, that his family can be with him, that he can be at home. My son was very afraid of many things and being buried alone in a pantheon will terrify my baby. 'I just need the Public Ministry to release my son so that his father and mother can cremate him and we can have him at home. They will not allow me to cremate my son because my son as well as the other victims are part of an investigation because it was murder,'Juan Francisco Ortiz said amidst tears. 'My son is 12 years old. We are not looking for the culprits, we are not look for anything, we do not have anything against anyone.The conflicts that cartels have are between the cartels.' The restaurant massacre in Salamanca is the deadliest in the city since March 9, 2019 when at least 15 people were killed in an armed attack at Bar La Playa, a strip club. Federal authorities linked theSanta Rosa de Lima Cartel to the planned attack. Prosecutors said at least seven men participated shooting, and added that the suspects were looking for alleged members of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, considered the most powerful criminal organization in Mexico. The state of Guanajuato was among the most deadliest in Mexico with 2,834 homicides in 2019. Authorities reported 293 in the month of January, the most violent month in 20 years."
54,Unexpected technical complications will keep NASA's Lunar Gateway from being fully operational by 2024 and delay the agency's larger plans for a permanent moon base,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8119227/Unexpected-technical-complications-NASAs-Lunar-Gateway-fully-operational-2024.html,"NASA's ambitious plans to build a base on the surface of the moon will likely be delayed. According to NASA's Dough Loverro, who oversees the agency's human exploration programs, several aspects of the project's technical design and multi-phase rollout need to be revised. One of the first changes will affect NASA's touted Lunar Gateway, a space station planned to orbit the moon and to be used as a staging point for the subsequent construction of a base on the moon's surface. NASA had targeted a completion window for the Lunar Gateway in 2024, and promised construction on the lunar base would begin no later than 2025, but according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the Lunar Gateway is being reworked. NASA says it will still have a space station in orbit around the moon in 2024, but it won't initially be as capable as originally planned, likely delaying the completion date for the lunar base. The Gateway was also to be a launching point for NASA's later mission to Mars, planned for sometime in the 2030s, as well as a resource for commercial space travel companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. The aggressive timeline for the lunar gateway was originally set by the White House, which insisted NASA speed up its initial timeline for the project, which originally had the Lunar Gateway completed in 2028 instead of 2024. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration was eager to have a milestone event ready to coincide with what could be the end of Donald Trump's second term as president, should he win re-election in 2020. With the new timeline, a 'slimmed-down' version of the Lunar Gateway is still on track to be in orbit around the moon by 2024, but it's still unclear how limited it will be compared to the original vision. 'We are looking at alternatives to make sure we can achieve sustainability as soon as possible,' Loverro said. Loverro suggested NASA will instead make its top priority the development of a new family of rockets capable of completing a roundtrip mission to the moon in 2024, with a target cost of $2billion per launch. Russia and the United States are cooperating on a NASA-led project to build the first lunar space station, codenamed the Lunar Gateway. The agreement, signed in September 2017, is part of a long-term project to send humans to Mars. The crew-tended spaceport will orbit the moon and serveas a 'gateway to deep space and the lunar surface,' NASA has said. The first modules of the station could be completed as soon as 2024. An international base for lunar exploration for humans and robots and a stopover for spacecraft is a leading contender to succeed the $100 billion International Space Station (ISS), the world's largest space project to date. Nasa asked European scientists and industry leaders to join the agency in September 2018. Accepting the offer could cost the European Space Agency (ESA) - of which Britain is a key member - an estimated Â£1 billion ($1.3 billion). A decision on whether to become involved will be taken at a meeting of European science ministers next year. In the mean time, the ESA is drawing up plans for the form its section of the station could take."

Ebony Lumpkin, 30, from Virginia Beach, Virginia, is constantly being peppered with inquisitive questions by strangers about her relationship to Matthew, seven. Although the family 'mostly get compliments', they also face a barrage of queries about whether the schoolboy has different genetic heritage to his mother and father. The family have trawled back through their family trees but say they can find no evidence of a previous red-head. So constant have the questions begun that Ebony, a Navy veteran, has recently dyed her hair red in a bid to make Matthew feel more comfortable after he was taunted by his peers. Scroll down for video Research shows that both Ebony and Matthew's father, Patrick Tebbe, 32, must carry the MC1R gene which is linked most strongly to red hair. Ebony said of her constant conversations: 'A five-minute trip with Matthew always turned into an hour one as people are in awe with him. 'They are always complimenting his hair but then look twice at me and make speculations.I can't count how many times I have had to explain I'm his mother, not nanny nor is he adopted. She added: 'I understand it is rare to see a black mother with a white child who has red hair - I was shocked when I first saw him too! 'But I would prefer it if they were mindful about how they ask - especially in front of Matthew. 'It is disheartening to hear and makes him question his role in the family. Children are volatile and care about what others think - it is very confusing for him when strangers question if I am his mother. 'He once spent a whole week asking every red-haired woman if they were his 'real mummy' after schoolkids told him I am not. 'Another time a woman rang the police as she assumed, I had kidnapped Matthew from a white lady who had helped me put on his shoe in the supermarket. Ebony revealed the family had been to the doctors that day and had Matthew's birth certificate - but added that even the police officer didn't believe her at first. She explained: 'It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.' However, it isn't always negative remarks, Matthew has racked up over 3000 followers - who love his hair - on Instagram. She added: 'We have learnt to embrace the prolonged trips to the store as the positive comments outweigh the negative. The gene for a particular feature comes in several alternative versions called 'alleles'. Some are dominant and some recessive. Dominant genes are likely to control the outcome of your inherited trait, while recessive genes may skip a generation or two before their impact is made known. For example, if you inherit an allele for dark hair from either or both parents then it is likely your hair colour will be dark. However, it is possible to have two parents with black hair who conceive a red-headed child. This is because both the mother and father carried a hidden, recessive red-headed gene which they inherited from their own parents or grandparents. You hand on only one of your two, at random, to the next generation. As red is recessive it will skip a generation if a dominant dark gene is present and can appear unexpectedly in the next - if both parents hand over their recessive red gene, not the dark one, to that particular child. Likewise, if both parents carry the same recessive gene, say for blond hair, they can have a blondhaired child even if they are both dark. 'Matthew loves the attention and has even been scouted by a modelling agency. Adam often feels left out which is why he suggested we dye our hair red to match Matthew's. 'It touched my heart to hear he wanted to be like his little brother, and it shows they both appreciate his unique look. 'When Matthew saw the grand reveal, he was thrilled, and it was one of the greatest joys of my life.' After looking through five generations of her family and Matthew's dad, Patrick Tebbe's, 32, but there's no sign of red hair which prompted Ebony to research her heritage further. She adds: 'Many people say 'he must get the hair from his dad's side' but none of his family have red hair. 'The research I found said both parents must carry the MC1R gene for this to happen to one of their kids. 'I would like other people to be knowledgeable and learn about genetics before making rude remarks.'"

Vanessa Paradis, the actorâ€™s former longtime partner, came to the defense of the Pirates Of The Caribbean star in a legal declaration that was submitted to the court. â€˜I have known Johnny Deep for more than 25 Years,â€™ Paradis wrote in the court documents obtained by The Blast. â€˜Weâ€™ve been partners for 14 years and we raised out two children together. Through all these years, Iâ€™ve known Johnny to be kind, attentive, generous, and a non-violent person and father.â€™ The actress went on to acknowledge that sheâ€™s been aware of Heardâ€™s accusations of physical and emotional abuse for more than four years. â€˜This is nothing like the true Johnny I have known, and from my personal experience of many years, I can say he was never violent or abusive to me.â€™ She even went as far as to call Heardâ€™s allegation untrue. â€˜I have seen that these outrageous statements have been really distressing, and also caused damage to his career because, unfortunately, people have gone on believing these false facts,â€™ she explained. Several other of Deppâ€™s famous friends and ex-partners have publicly come to the defense of the actor, including Penelope Cruz and Winona Ryder, who herself submitted a legal declaration and stated, from her experience, that it was â€˜impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true.â€™ She added, â€˜I find it extremely upsetting knowing him as I do.â€™ Depp, 56, filed the defamation lawsuit against Heard in March 2019 over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in December 2018, in which she claimed she was abused by Deep. As part of his lawsuit, Deep claimed that Heard had physically abused him during their marriage rather than the other way around, a claim Heard has denied. Deep and Paradis, a French singer and actress, were together from 1999 to 2012, and share daughter Lily-Rose, 20, and son John Christopher, 17. Deep and Heard were married in February 2015. She filed for divorce in May of 2016, along with a temporary restraining order against him, stating in a court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive during their relationship. The two sides reached a settlement and finalized the divorce in January 2017, which included the dismissal of the restraining order and Deep paying her $7 million that she subsequently donated to charity.

Weinstein was rushed into care in New York last Wednesday in the hours following his sentencing to 23 years behind bars for rape and a criminal sex act. The shamed producer, 67, was taken to Bellevue Hospital for monitoring but sources have told the New York Post he has since been transferred to Rikers Island. Weinstein was sentenced to 20 years on the criminal sex act charge for forcibly performing oral sex on production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006. He was sentenced to three years for third degree rape for a 2013 attack on Jessica Mann. Scroll down for video The disgraced producer was initially brought to Rikers Island Prison after sentencing but was transferred to Bellevue Hospital. 'Harvey was having chest pains and the Rikers staff decided for safety to send him back to Bellevue now. He will be evaluated and likely will stay overnight. We appreciate the care and concern of the Department of Corrections officers and staff,' his spokesperson Juda Engelmayer said last week. A spokesman had said he had suffered a heart attack and sources claimed he underwent an emergency angioplasty, a procedure to open clogged arteries. But they later rowed back on that diagnosis, instead confirming he was suffering from high blood pressure, The New York Times reported. At the time, lawyers, Arthur Aidala, said he was in good spirits. He previously spent multiple days in the hospital after his conviction last month with different ailments.Weinstein's attorney Donna Rotunno has suggested that he will now die in prison, adding that he 'won't see the light of day' after his sentencing. Once one of Hollywood's most influential producers, Weinstein had faced the possibility of a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison. Weinstein,who is in poor health, will not be eligible for parole for 20 years.  His defense team slammed the punishment as 'obscene' and already vowed to appeal. Weinstein's defense attorney Donna Rotunno criticized the judge and jury outside court, saying the trial was totally unfair. Rotunno, who said they would be appealing by July, said the sentence was 'too harsh'. Asked about the impact of the #MeToo movement, Rotunno said: 'This says nothing to me about the #MeToo movement other than the judge felt some type of pressure.' Speaking on Bill Hemmer Reports on Fox News on Wednesday evening, Rotunno added that Weinstein 'won't see the light of day' and is likely to die in prison. 'I think the number is too large,' Rotunno told Hemmer. 'I think it's too large for the evidence that we heard and I think it's too large for the charges that the jury found him guilty of.' Last Wednesday, prosecutors in Los Angeles also announced that they had started the extradition process to bring Harvey Weinstein to California, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Prosecutors in Los Angeles filed sexual assault charges against Weinstein in January and have now begun the process of extraditing him from New York to their jurisdiction. A LADA spokesman said: 'The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has begun the process of extraditing defendant Weinstein to California to face the sexual assault charges that were filed in January. 'No arraignment date has been set. Once a date has been set, our office will notify the public.' Weinstein was charged with one felony count each of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint. His attorney Rotunno claimed she can't see 'how much California really matters' given the 23-year sentence Weinstein received Wednesday and his diminishing health. Weinstein used a walker throughout his trial and arrived at the courthouse Wednesday in wheelchair because of back problems from a car crash last summer. He has a condition that requires shots in his eyes and last week had a stent placed to unblock an artery. 'I think it becomes ceremonial obviously,' she said. 'If we are successful on appeal, it may make a bigger difference. But with numbers so large and Harvey's health, I don't know how he leaves [prison in New York]. 'Even if at this juncture if they offered him a sentence that was concurrent, again I think with the number that has been handed down to him today, he won't see the light of day especially given his health,' Rotunno continued. 'So I don't even know if that's a practical or necessary conversation to have.' After sentencing, Weinstein was immediately placed under the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. He was to be transferred from the city's jail system to the state prison system but has now returned to hospital.  Weinstein did not apologize to his victims but said he felt remorse for the men and women in the #MeToo fight before he was sentenced to 23 years in prison for sex crimes in a landmark case. 1979 - Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob found independent film distribution and production company Miramax, naming it after their parents, Miriam and Max.

Judge James Burke, who oversaw his trial, ordered Weinstein to serve the sentences consecutively and sentenced him to five years post release supervision for each charge. 'Although this is a first conviction, this is not a first offense,' the judge said before revealing the prison sentence. Weinstein maintained a blank face and did not visibly react. Weinstein, who still faces separate sex crimes charges in Los Angeles, was wheeled out of the court in his wheelchair immediately after and taken to the maximum security Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York, before being brought to Bellevue Hospital with chest pains. After two of his accusers confronted him in court with their victim impact statements, Weinstein broke his courtroom silence to say he felt 'remorse for this situation' but said he was perplexed by the case and the #MeToo climate in which it unfolded. He offered no apology to his victims. 'We may have different truths, but I have remorse... For all of you and for all the men and women going through this crisis right now in this country,' Weinstein said, adding he was worried about 'thousands of men' being denied due process in the #MeToo era. 'I'm totally confused. I think men are confused about these issues,' he said in a calm but creaking voice, adding that he had fond memories of his accusers and believed he had a 'serious friendship' with both Mann and Haleyi. 'I can't stop looking at Jessica and Mimi and hoping something maybe from our old relationship could emerge,' he said. Looking back during the trial at emails he exchanged with his accusers, he said he thought they had a good friendship. 'I'm not going to say these aren't great people. I had wonderful times with these people,' he said. Weinstein had begged for mercy prior to his sentencing, telling the court he had been through 'hell on earth' and was 'really trying to be a better person.' He noted that he hadn't seen his three adult children since the allegations publicly surfaced and that he may never see his two youngest children again. Weinstein acknowledged going to 'extraordinary lengths' to hide the affairs he had from his two ex-wives, Eve Chilton and Georgina Chapman. 'They had nothing to do with any of it. I was unfaithful to both and I just can't tell you how bad I feel from that,' he said. At one point, Weinstein started talking about how he had raised millions of dollars for New York City after Hurricane Sandy and September 11. Once one of Hollywood's most influential producers, Weinstein had faced the possibility of a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison. Weinstein's defense attorney Donna Rotunno slammed the judge and jury outside court, saying the trial was totally unfair and that he 'really never had a fair shake from day one.' 'We were looking for fairness, and we didn't get it,' Rotunno said. Rotunno, who said they would be appealing by July, said the sentence was 'too harsh'. Asked about the impact of the #MeToo movement, Rotunno said: 'This says nothing to me about the #MeToo movement other than the judge felt some type of pressure.' Weinstein was sentenced a week shy of his 68th birthday, and his lawyers argued that a lengthy prison term would, in effect, be a life sentence. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said afterward that the judge 'sent a message today that this type behavior is something that any potential offender is going to have to consider. 'The judge took it seriously, which is exactly how we think he should have. And we're grateful.' Appearing before the media outside court, attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three of the women who testified at Weinstein's trial, waved a piece of paper saying, 'This is what justice looks like, 20 + 3 years.' Mann and Haleyi, who delivered victim impact statements on Wednesday, were joined in court by four of Weinstein's other accusers: Annabella Sciorra, Tarale Wulff, Dawn Dunning and Lauren Marie Young. All six women testified during Weinstein's high-profile trial last month but only Mann and Haleyi were allowed to address the court. Harvey Weinstein broke his courtroom silence with a rambling five-minute statement in which he said he felt perplexed by the case and the #MeToo climate in which it unfolded. Some of his statement is below. 'We may have different truths, but I have remorse... For all of you and for all the men and women going through this crisis right now in this country. 'Thousands of men are losing due process. I'm worried about this country. 'I'm totally confused. I think men are confused about these issues. 'The movement basically started with meâ€¦ now there are thousands of men who are being accused. He said he had fond memories of his accusers and believed he had a 'serious friendship' with both Mann and Haleyi. 'I'm not going to say these aren't great people. I had wonderful times with these people. 'I went through extraordinary lengths to hide my affairs. 'They had nothing to do with any of it. I was unfaithful to both and I just can't tell you how bad I feel from that.' 'I had no great powers in this industry. Miramax, at the height of its fame, was a small firm. 'That's what it was, but it became blown up - like power, power, power. I wasn't' about power, I was about making great movie. 'I'm not going to run away from some of the things I did say. 'Yes, I said bad things to people but there are so many people, thousands of people, who would say great things about me. 'I really feel remorse for this situation. I feel it deeply in my heart. 'I'm really trying to be a better person. 'I haven't seen my three older children since the New York Times (and) the New Yorker articles came out. 'That for me is hell on earth. I may never see my children again.' "

But Gisele Bundchen proved she still has an incredibly enviable figure on during a family trip to Costa Rica with her NFL star husband Tom Brady and their two children two weeks ago. On Thursday, the 39-year-old also took time to post on Instagram to post about the crisis around the world as the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, spreads. Sharing a photo of herself as the sunsets and birds fly behind her, Gisele posted a message in Portuguese and English, sharing her view on the current worldwide situation, regarding the novel Coronavirus that has put cities around the world on lockdown. 'What is happening in the world is the ultimate reminder that we are all connected to each other and what we choose to do it going to affect us all,' she wrote. 'For this moment of crisis, we need to understand the importance of physical distancing. We need to protect each other so we don't get sick and can all stay well together.' Adding: 'Even if you are young and healthy, we all need to follow the recommended protocols and precautions because in doing so we can end up saving someone's life - particularly the elderly and those who are sick and immunocompromised.' She encouraged her followers to 'act in solidarity' with those who are elderly and at higher risk and to 'act in the best interests of our common society.' Though she also said to not 'let fear and anxiety consume our minds. These feelings generate stress and stress lowers our immune system and our ability to fight infections and viruses. Gisele thanked healthcare workers currently in the middle of this fight and said 'we are all in this together.' When not Instagramming, the former Victoria's Secret Angel was dressed perfectly for some time in the sand and ocean, getting her mind off of the global panic. She wore simply a green-toned triangle bikini with lowrise bottoms. Looking perfectly sunkissed, her blonde hair was down in beachy waves and she seemed to go makeup-free. Gisele really seemed to enjoy herself, running down the beach near the water, throwing her hands back and frolicking along. At one point she took a dip in the water with her son Benjamin, aged ten, and daughter Vivian, aged seven and a male friend. Her husband Tom Brady didn't join the sunset beach dip. Though, Gisele had fun and threw on a black beach cover-up dress. She posed seductively in the sand seemingly looking to a camera. Along with her daughter, she posed with the family dog who also made the trip for some photos. Gisele and family are spending time in the sun while husband Brady decides his next moves professionally. The trip comes after the six-time Super Bowl Champion announced via Instagram on Monday that he is launching a multi-platform content company named 199 Productions. He wrote: 'I'm excited to announce to the world the official launch of 199 Productions. 'When I was the 199th draft pick in 2000, I knew I needed to work hard every day to prove myself.' Brady and Bundchen celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary last month. Tom and Gisele wed in Santa Monica, California on February 26, 2009 with a second ceremony in Costa Rica after they began dating in 2006. "

60,Israel bans people from leaving their homes for 'non-essential' reasons and will track coronavirus sufferers' phones to stop the spreadÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121735/Israel-track-coronavirus-sufferers-phones-alert-comes-contact-carrier.html,"Israel has banned residents from leaving their homes for 'non-essential' reasons and announced it plans to track coronavirus sufferers' phones during the outbreak. Massively restricting movement, the health ministry ordered people to stay home unless they need to buy food or medicine, seek medical attention, or travel to a workplace where there are no more than ten people. They also suspended all public transport at night. The Middle Eastern country has reported 324 cases of COVID-19 but no deaths. A directive issued by the government today read: 'You must not leave your homes to visit parks, playgrounds, the beach, the pool or libraries. 'You should maintain social contacts by media and not entertain friends or family unless they live in your building.' The statement did not say when the new regulations come into force. AFP was unable to immediately reach a health ministry spokesman. It was released after officials confirmed that Israel would use anti-terror laws to access geolocation data and send alerts to individuals that come into contact with confirmed sufferers. The spying powers are usually only reserved for tackling Palestinian-linked terrorism. But an extension of their use for a 'limited period' was signed off by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet on Monday night.  Israel has adopted sweeping measures to contain the virus. These also include prison sentences of up to six months for anyone breaching isolation orders and police being allowed to use 'reasonable force' to break-up gatherings of ten or more people. Opposition politicians today claimed the move was a step too far and would 'surrender transparency and oversight' over privacy rules. But Mr Netanyahu defended the move, saying halting the virus's spread outweighed concerns about the invasion of privacy. Delaying the measure could also 'lead to the deaths of a great many Israelis', he claimed. He added: 'These means will help us greatly in locating the ill and thus stopping the spread of the virus. 'We will approve these digital tools for a limited period of 30 days. Israel is a democracy and we have to balance individual rights with the greater needs of all.' Mobile phones constantly receive signals from satellites revealing the owner's movements. The new measures will use this data to create a picture of an infected person's movements before they were diagnosed with the virus. Anyone who may have been exposed to them will then be identified and sent a warning by text message to self-quarantine. Nadav Argaman, head of internal security agency Shin Bet - Israel's equivalent of MI5 - today confirmed the unprecedented move and moved to reassure concerns over privacy. He said: 'The other state bodies don't have the necessary technological means to aid this effort. 'I am well aware of the sensitivity of this matter and therefore have instructed that only a very limited number of agents will be handling this and the information will not be saved in the Shin Bet database.' Further measures announced by Israel include putting the majority of public sector workers on leave for one month and banning more than 30 per cent attendance in private sector workplaces. Israel has so far had 324 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but no recorded deaths. In the Palestinian territories 41 cases have been confirmed in the occupied West Bank, with none in the Gaza Strip. Israel has already closed schools, malls, restaurants and most leisure spaces as well as limiting gatherings to ten."
61,On the run! Coronavirus pandemic sparks massive jail break in Brazil as over 800 prisoners escape from four prisons after the country reported its first virus-related death,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121467/Coronavirus-pandemic-sparks-massive-jail-break-Brazil-800-prisoners-escaped-prisons.html,"More than 800 inmates broke out offour prisons in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, after the Justice Department announced it was postponing a work program that allowed inmates to leave jails amid the coronavirus panic. The massive jailbreak came asBrazil confirmed its first coronavirus-linked death Tuesday, a 62-year-old man who died at a private hospital in SÃ£o Paulo. Health officials said he had suffered from diabetes, hypertension and prostatic hyperplasia. Authorities have now recaptured around half of the 834 that fled on Monday. Video footage showed the disturbing moment some of 577 men escaped from theProgression CenterPenitentiary in the SÃ£o Paulo municipality ofMongaguÃ¡. Officials reported that 172 were recaptured. A separate cellphone video recorded on the grounds of jail's soccer pitch showed various inmates milling around before fleeing. Prison officials reported that nine prison guards were held hostage during clashes inside the jail that has a capacity of1,700 detainees, but holds close to 2,800, according to Brazilian news outlet G1. The breakouts occurred afterthe Justice Department announced it was postponing a work program that allowed inmates to leave jails because government officials feared that they would return infected with coronavirus and spread it the deadly disease to other prisoners. At theProgression Center Penitentiary in Porto Feliz, 178 prisoners reportedly fled during the prison riot, but all were apprehended and returned to the detention center as of 8:30am local time. Officials, however, did not produce a final tally of how many inmates barged out of the facility after prisoners set various fires across the facility before police and prison guards responded with tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the violence. Another 75 prisoners fled the Dr. Edgar MagalhÃ£es Noronha jail in the municipality ofTremembÃ© before they were later arrested. The SumarÃ© Resocialization Center inSumarÃ© reported that four of its 218 detainees were caught Monday night. One jail guard was held hostage but later freed by the inmates. A brawl at theMirandÃ³polis Penitentiary left nine inmates injured, including two who were hurt while fighting among themselves. No prisoners escaped from the facility. 'Faced with a [coronavirus] problem, the government acted in the manner of choosing the one that was least harmful to society,' said Nivaldo Restivo, secretary of the Penitentiary Administration. 'The people of SÃ£o Paulo need to be preserved above any other option.' The government of SÃ£o Paulo has been prudent with its handling of the coronavirus as it has confirmed 152 cases. Brazilian state health departments reported 301 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday, although Health Ministry has documented only 234."
62,Think the stock market will bounce back from the coronavirus panic? Here's how to take advantage,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/isainvesting/article-8091429/How-invest-think-shares-bounce-coronavirus.html,"Global markets are crashing, fear over Covid-19 is growing and market uncertainty is prevalent, but some may believe now is the best time to get into investing - to buy shares in the sales after a huge fall. The FTSE 100 saw its second biggest daily drop last Thursday at 10.9 per cent and is down 33 per cent on its mid January peak. After the panic selling, many big name companies are cheaper than they were and some are very cheap (although with airlines, for example, there is a reason for that). Investors might be thinking therefore that there are bargains to be had. But is it ever wise to try and catch a falling knife, as the investing expression on buying into market crashes goes? Some amateur investors have been sniffing around said 'bargains', with Barclays' Smart Investor platform seeing its highest buy percentage on record last Tuesday at 73 per cent versus 27 per cent of sales. The problem for those investors is that after that the market fell on Wednesday, tanked on Thursday, rose on Friday, slumped again on Monday and is down again today. Yet, those who have been thinking about investing, but have never taken the plunge could be in a better position than people already invested and in the red. Some of the world's biggest names have seen millions - even billions - wiped off their value, meaning entry prices are lower and new investors have the added benefit of starting without any losses. What they must steel themselves for is more potential falls before any gains - and they must be happy taking risk and thinking long-term. Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, said new investors have cash - which is 'one of the most powerful things going for them'. He said: 'New investors can go into the market without the need to sell something first and looking for a better opportunity or to balance out a heavy loss. 'You don't have to buy everything today or in one big go. It's better to slowly feed into the market as it will still be volatile and there will be swings. 'But by starting out now, you've already avoided major losses of as much as 20 per cent. Though that's not to say it can't fall further.' David Coombs, fund manager at Rathbone Investment Management, advises starting out by investing 25 per cent of your cash into the biggest companies that you are 100 per cent sure can get through recessions, coronaviruses, or any other panics that may come along. He said: 'I've been investing for 35 years but I'm not trying to be clever here, I'd rather be cautious. They're the names I have been adding to across my portfolios. 'Think of your Warren Buffett-type companies: the Visas, the Microsofts, the Coca Colas of this world. 'They're the mega-cap companies that may not be down as much as the airlines but you will still make enough money.' He also advises against going into middle-sized companies, or really beaten up energy firms at this stage as it's harder to tell how they will move going forward. 'It doesn't always pay to be too clever and go for oil stocks when they're down 20 to 30 per cent - that might look smart but it might not work out.' Meanwhile, Coombs think US equity funds, as those investing in American shares are called, are the best bet at the moment although the pound's fall against the dollar could pose an issue. 'I would recommend buying something like the S&P 500 tracker that hedges to sterling (just in case sterling rallies) which can be bought through a passive provider such as BlackRock or Vanguard. 'If you want to stay in the UK though, it might be best to avoid the FTSE 100 at the moment because it is too reliant on banks, minors and energy companies.' On bonds - which are often considered safe havens during times of crisis, and which were among the best performers during the last week of February as the coronavirus panic took a step up - Coombs said you could end up losing a lot of money as a new investor. 'You don't need to buy any safe havens if you don't have a portfolio to begin with. First-time investors don't need them. 'Coronavirus could peak next week, the oil price could go back up, and the next thing you know, the market rallies. Then bond and gold markets would sell off and you could lose a lot of money.' Most importantly however, is to have a system in place that you then stick to. Lowcock says to do your research and not to rush to invest just because the market has sold off. Royal Dutch Shell BP Lloyds iShares FTSE 100 ETF Aviva Legal & General Scottish Mortgage IT Premier Oil Barclays Vanguard FTSE 100 ETF 'Have a plan in place,' he said. 'Decide how you're going to invest whether that's through a platform - which means you have exposure to a range of managers and market leading rates - or directly through an asses manager where you can more easily access trading systems and monitor their portfolios. 'Also think about what type of product you're investing in and why you're investing. 'Your time horizon shouldn't be the next ten weeks or so, it should be the next ten years. Keeping that perspective in mind, then sell-offs are a good time to start investing.' Once you've decided when and how you're going to invest, Coombs recommends only using 25 per cent of your cash and to then to 'do nothing until the market takes another leg down'. He added: 'It's better to drip feed and do it in chunks. Set yourself levels of the index at which point you're going to invest - for example, say you're going to invest if the FTSE 100 drops to 5,800, and again at 5,500. It pays to take the emotion out of it and set up a system and stick to it.' It's also important to remember investing shouldn't be a short-term game. Markets will rise and fall and over time and will usually recoup short-term losses as the economy recovers. Joe Healey, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: 'What is different regarding this drawback is it was not created by fundamental weaknesses within the economy; rather it has been caused by factors outside of anyone's control. 'This suggests that in the longer-term should the virus impact markets it can likely be mitigated.' Now is also a good time for younger investors to get started. With more time on their side, they can take more risk in pursuit of growth, should they wish, and look at sectors such as technology, communication services or consumer companies.  Growth companies tend to pursue share price appreciation for their shareholders accelerating revenues and profits to grow shareholder value. Healey added: 'For the younger investors with a lower risk tolerance, sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare or utilities may be more suitable. 'These companies prefer to focus on sustainable business models distributing company profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. 'These types of companies are generally more sheltered from market cycles in periods of instability. 'But regardless of your investor profile, the most important thing is getting invested in the first place and allowing your hard-earned money to work for you. 'Of course, there are going to be ups and downs but over the longer-term, studies highlight the benefits of being invested through market cycles. 'Furthermore, powers such as compounding will help build your capital over time. The earlier investors start, the more time these powers can generate healthy returns in the long term.'

63,Instagram model threatens to SNEEZE on a 'rude' waitress after allegedly receiving poor service at a restaurant amid coronavirus panic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8118563/Instagram-model-threatens-sneeze-rude-waitress-allegedly-receiving-poor-service.html,"An Instagram influencer has copped a barrage of online backlash after she publicly threatened to sneeze on a waitress amid the deadly coronavirus pandemic. Food blogger and fashion influencer Karylle Banez took to Instagram on Monday night to complain about the disappointing service she allegedly received while dining at Leigh Street Wine Room in Adelaidefour nights earlier. She also snapped a photo at the natural wine bar dressed in an outfit from chain fashion store Pretty Little Thing. 'If I had the coronavirus I know exactly who I be sneezing on (@ the rude waitress here),' she captioned the photo. Ms Banez later replied in the comments to her 63,100 followers: 'I came in so happy and cheerful, then she came over with such an attitude. She legit rolled her eyes when I asked her for the drinks list. Absolutely no need to treat people like that I feel.' Leigh Street Wine Room hit back and contacted Ms Banez asking her to omit the reference about coronavirus, which remained unedited on Tuesday morning. 'We found out when a few guests emailed us, mortified about what had been posted,' owner Sali Sasi told Daily Mail Australia. 'She came in wanting a glass of moscato, which we didn't have. The waitress gave her four or five wine tastings, the girl did her photo shoot and then left.' Ms Sasi supplied Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of the directmessages she sent to Ms Banez. She apologised for the bad experience Ms Banez received but was disappointed about the coronavirus reference. 'My followers know I joke a lot and not to take me seriously,' Ms Banez responded to one of the messages. Ms Sasi replied: It's not a joke. It's a life threatening pandemic. I politely asked you to alter your caption regarding coronavirusand you clearly don't deem it necessary. If that's the way you behave, then I can only assume my team member had good reason to eye roll you.' Ms Banez's post was inundated with angry comments with many describing her as the rude one. 'I cant believe your words! Disgusting and disrespectful to all the people who are suffering from this tragedy today,' one wrote. Another added: Let's all blame servers for being a bit off whilst WORKING THROUGH A PANDEMIC. I'm sure you got the reception you deserved.' Others jumped to the defence of the popular wine bar. 'The venue greets you, seats you with the drinks menu. Did you not wait to be seated? Did you use it as a runway first? Venue after? Many unanswered questions. But I do hope you catch some common sense before you catch COVID-19,' one person commented.  Ms Banez later uploaded another post captioned: 'Love getting trolled by people who don't know me.' Leigh Street Wine Bar, which opened just six months ago, has been inundated with public support since the post went viral. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Banez for comment. It's not the first time Ms Banez's dining experiences have sparked public controversy. Adelaide cafe Fine and Fettle came under fire last May for their partnership with the food blogger to promote their new menu. The restaurant was flooded with online backlash after sharing a photo of Ms Banez wearing a barely-there bralette on its Facebook page. The blogger was also trolled online. 'The online bullying that Karylle has experienced as a result of her outfit is absolutely unacceptable,' Fine and Fettle chef Sam Worrall-Thompson told Daily Mail Australia at the time."
64,China begins clinical trials for its first coronavirus vaccine developed by the nation's top military bio-warfare expert,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121567/Coronavirus-vaccine-developed-Chinas-military-bio-warfare-expert-begins-clinical-trial.html,"China has launched the clinical trials for its first coronavirus vaccine, which is developed by the country's top military bio-warfare expert and her team. Chen Wei, the lead researcher, announced last night that Beijing has granted permission to start the tests. 'Vaccine is the strongest scientific weapon to end the coronavirus,' the bio-warfare expert told state broadcaster CCTV. 'If China is the first country to invent such weapons and have our own patents, it shows the progress of our science and the image of a giant country.' The research team has also prepared for large-scale production of the vaccine, Chen added. China has revealed key medicine and treatment used to battle the coronavirus, a spokesperson from China's State Council announced today. The recommended treatment for the coronavirus includes blood plasma from recovered patients and traditional Chinese medicine. It comes as China has gained significant process in its scientific research, said Zhang Xinmin, Director of the Biology Centre from the State Council. 'China upholds the idea of â€‹â€‹a community of shared future for mankind and is willing to share [the scientific progress] with the international community,' Zhang added. The Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine was successfully developed following more than a month of research, including the study of the vaccines for Ebola. Chen, also a leading specialist in genetic engineering vaccines in China, developed a medical spray during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The product prevented around 14,000 medical workers from contracting the virus, said another state-media report. She is also known in the country as the 'terminator of Ebola' for leading a team to create a vaccine against the fatal illness. Speaking of fighting the novel coronavirus, Chen said: 'The epidemic is like a military situation. The epicentre equals to the battlefield.' The 54-year-old expert, also a Major General of the People's Army, has been working on the coronavirus vaccine since arriving in Wuhan on January 26, according to the press. Chen and her team were already developing a quicker way to screen the COVID-19 coronavirus from a tent in the epicenter on January 30, according to an official report from China. The news comes asBeijing reported just one new domestic case today in comparison to 15,152 just five weeks ago while the number of deaths and infections in Europe continue to soar. The single case in Wuhan will boost China's view that it has 'basically curbed' the spread of the pathogen which emerged in the city last December. But the country is now concerned about an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day. In a reversal of roles, Beijing is now requiring almost all international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels. Meanwhile, scientists warned that dramatic lockdown measures, which have started coming into force across the UK today, could last for 18 months or more. Prime Minister Boris Johnson last night announced the UK's epidemic was entering the 'fast growth' phase and people should stop socialising, stop going out, work from home and avoid contact with elderly or unwell relatives and friends. Over-70s and those with long-term health conditions like asthma, heart disease or kidney disease should be extra strict about not coming into contact with others, he added. Britons have also been urged not travel abroad at all unless it is essential, the Foreign Office announced today. The UK's spiralling epidemic is expected to kill thousands of people and rumble on through the summer and potentially into next year, experts say. There may already be 55,000 people infected in the UK, according to the UK's chief scientific adviser. London, which is said to be 'weeks ahead' of the rest of the country, is the worst-hit area of the UK and has confirmed at least 480 cases, with Kensington and Chelsea the most infected borough (43 cases). What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
65,Make-up expert sparks anger with 'coronavirus mask' beauty tutorial videoÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121831/Make-expert-sparks-anger-coronavirus-mask-beauty-tutorial-video.html,"A social media influencer has sparked fury after posting a 'coronavirusmask' beauty tutorial video online. Fatima Aldewan has been accused of belittling the tragedy of a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of thousands of people after posting a clip on how to apply make-up while wearing a face mask. The Iraqi star, who is based in the UAE, shared the controversial instructions in which she describes how to use make-up to sport a so-called 'coronavirus look' with her 80,000 followers. The elaborate clip, which lasts six minutes, shows followers how to correctly put on a coronavirus protection mask before she begins applying make-up. She claimed that video was created at the request of her followers despite the mounting infection rate in Iraq and across the world. The footage showedAldewan holding up a box containing a protective face mask, which she took out and held up to the camera. She then took out a mascara brush and applied it while wearing the blue surgical mask. Aldewan then applied eye shadow and fake eye lashes, all while describing the process to her fans. The video got more than 76,000 views with many social media users left furious and accused the online star of downplaying the severity of the ongoing global contagion. One social media user said: 'Whitewash! People are dying from this illness and you are taking it as mere fun.' Another added: 'Even the coronavirus now has a makeup look. What kind of stupidity are you guys living in?' An online commentator said: 'People are dying from this illness, show some respect and have some boundaries.' Iraq, a total of 124 people have been infected, with authorities confirming at least 10 total deaths."
66,Tennessee's first case of coronavirus describes what it is like to be 'patient zero' with people asking if 'you are the one' who infected othersÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120507/Tennessee-resident-coronavirus-describes-like-patient-zero.html,"A Tennessee father has described what it was like to be 'patient zero' when he became the state's first case ofcoronavirus. Chris Baumgartner told how he was repeatedly asked 'if you are the ''one''' by an 'irrational public' who demanded answers from him. The 44-year-old was the self-proclaimed 'patient zero' inTennessee, and said his symptoms were at the mild end of the spectrum. But despite not suffering greatly from the disease,Baumgartner says he and his family endured 'mass hysteria' and the 'stigma' of having the virus. In a lengthy Facebook post written on Sunday and published alongside a picture ofBaumgartner covered in bubble wrap, he described how it affected him and his family mentally. Baumgartner said fellow Williamson County residents demanded 'to know if you are the ''one'' where you live, and if you might have somehow infected their child or family'. He wrote:'These past few weeks have certainly been interesting, to say the least. 'My family has not only had a front row seat to the mass hysteria we are now experiencing as a nation, but we've also been part of the storyline. 'It's given us a whole new appreciation for those who live under the cloud of stigma every single day of their lives.' But despite those issues, hordes of other community members have empathized with his family's ordeal, Baumgartner said. Supporters have sent the family meals, groceries, cards and books, among other items to help keep them occupied during their time in quarantine, Baumgartner said in his post, which also pictured his wife wearing a black garbage bag. He added: 'We've had literally hundreds and hundreds of calls, messages, and texts encouraging us, praying for us, and people pausing from their own challenges in life, to walk through this crazy situation with us. 'Something incredible happens when fear and anxiety are replaced with acts of kindness and compassion.' Baumgartner wrote on social media that he is still recovering and ofered to house sit for any neighbors over spring break. Coronavirus cases continue to grow in Tennessee and across and the US with Tennessee's Department of Health reporting 52 cases as of Monday. On March 5, Govenor Bill Lee announced that a Williamson County man had tested positive for the virus, making it the first case in the state. Williamson County now has the second most amount of cases in the state with 18. Across the US as of Monday, the number of COVID-19 cases topped 4,600 with 86 deaths."
67,Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are released from hospital in Australia into self-quarantine after contracting coronavirusÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8119331/Tom-Hanks-released-hospital-virus-quarantine.html,"Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson have been released from the Australian hospital where they were in isolation since testing positive for the coronavirus last week. The multiple Oscar-winning actor was on the Gold Coast near Brisbane to film an Elvis Presley biopic directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann when he and Wilson, both 63, came down with the disease. Their son Chet revealed the news in an Instagram post on Monday. 'A quick update on my folks: They're out of the hospital,' Chet said in an Instagram video. 'They're still self-quarantined obviously, but they're feeling a lot better, so that's a relief.' Chet- who is a rapper and is in America while his parents are recovering in Australia also showed sympathy for others suffering through this global pandemic. In both the US and Australia, numbers of confirmed infections and deaths were ramping up. â€˜I just wanna say anyone else who has loved one or is afflicted with the virus themselves, my thoughts go out to you because my parents are not the only ones suffering,â€™ Chet added in the Instagram video Monday. But he begged people not to panic buy at the risk of depriving others in need. 'I think if you went to the grocery store and hoarded all the toilet paper, you're the problem,' Chet continued. 'You know what I mean? You should just think more of others for once... I know this is crazy, but I'm just wishing everyone the best and we're going to get through this.' Chet Hanks ended his message with well wishes. 'I just wish everyone a swift and speedy recovery,' he said. Australia has so far confirmed over 450 cases of coronavirus, with five deaths from the disease. Hanks was believed to have returned to the penthouse apartment in the Gold Coast where the couple had been staying while he worked on the Lurhmann film, in which he was due to portray Elvis' long-time manager, Colonel Tom Parker. The film, slated for release in October 2021, has suspended production, Warner Bros. said. The cast and crew are in self-isolation for 14 days. Queensland University Hospital has not confirmed media reports that the couple has gone back to the rented home. Hanks' management did not immediately respond to a request for comment. New South Wales: 210 Victoria: 94 Queensland: 78 South Australia: 32 Western Australia: 31 Tasmania: 7 Northern Territory: 1 Australian Capital Territory: 2 TOTAL CASES: 455 DEAD: 5 The couple have posted to social media about their run-in with COVID-19, thanking their Australian carers and urging their fans to follow the advice of experts on avoiding the disease. While in hospital Hanks tweeted his gratitude to the medical staff caring for them. The post, which included a photo of two pieces of toast smothered in Vegemite, sparked a furious social media debate about the correct amount and application of the popular spread. Wilson asked Twitter to help her compile a music playlist for those in isolation, calling it 'Quarantunes'. Wilson, a singer-songwriter, had given concerts in Sydney and Brisbane before testing positive for COVID-19 and Australian authorities have been tracking the couple's contacts to identify any other people who may have been infected. Australian television journalist Richard Wilkins has revealed that he tested positive to the virus on Sunday. He had met Wilson at the Sydney Opera House on March 7 and again at Nine Network's Sydney studio two days later. Two Nine hosts who interviewed Wilson on live television on March 9, David Campbell and Belinda Russell, returned to work on Tuesday after testing negative. They had been in home isolation since WilsonÂ´s diagnosis. Sydney Nova 96.9 radio hosts Ryan Fitzgerald and Michael Wipfli are in home isolation and were tested on Monday after news of Wilkins' infection. Wilkins broadcast from their studio on Thursday with Ten Network television entertainment editor Angela Bishop hours before Wilson's diagnosis was made public. Bishop has also been tested and is isolated at home. Wilkins' son Christian Wilkins was also tested because he spent the night of March 10 in his fatherÂ´s Sydney home. The 25-year-old son is competing in the Australian version of the reality TV show Dancing With the Stars, which is being broadcast without a studio audience because of the COVID-19 risk. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold.

'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.

The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms.

68,Avatar sequels have halted production in New Zealand due to the coronavirus... but the four movies will still be worked on in Los Angeles,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8121629/Avatar-sequels-halted-production-New-Zealand-spread-coronavirus.html,"Production on the Avatar sequels have been halted as part of attempts to halt the spread of coronavirus. The four movies, which are long-awaited follow-ups to 2009's Avatar, are being filmed in New Zealand, but have been put on hiatus due to the virus. Producer Jon Landau confirmed that work in New Zealand had been put on hold, although the executive team will continue working in Los Angeles. 'We've delayed it. We had plans to come down Friday night with a group of people and start back up and we made the decision to hold off and continue working here (Los Angeles), and come down there a little bit later than we'd planned,' he told the New Zealand Herald newspaper. 'We're in the midst of a global crisis and this is not about the film industry. I think everybody needs to do now whatever we can do, as we say here, to flatten the (coronavirus) curve.' Jon admits that he is unsure when production on James Cameron's motion picture will resume, although they were re-assessing the production schedule 'everyday'. The 59-year-old filmmaker, who collaborated with Cameron on 'Titanic', said: 'We try and monitor all this and look at things and think about what is in the best interest of our crew. I call it our Avatar family. That is really paramount to us above anything.' A crew member confirmed to the newspaper that they were waiting for confirmation of the delay, and that the production had been 'very supportive'. They said: 'At the moment it's still all up in the air. We'll find out in the next couple of days via email. It's not panic stations yet but I'm sure something will come through. 'The production is very supportive of us. We're not being laid off, it's on hold, so they're still committed to shooting it here as far as I know.' "
69,"Austrian Archduke Karl von Habsburg, 59, becomes the first royal in the world to be diagnosed with coronavirus - but insists he is 'fine' and brands the illness 'annoying'Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8120839/Austrian-Archduke-Karl-von-Habsburg-59-royal-world-diagnosed-coronavirus.html,"Karl von Habsburg, the Archduke of Austria, has tested positive for coronavirus and is being quarantined. The politician, 59,who is the head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and grandson of the last Emperor of Austria, Charles I of Austria, confirmed the news to Austrian TV channel oe24, after he began experiencing symptoms last week. He insisted he is 'fine' and branded the virus 'annoying', adding: 'It's not the black plague'. 'I thought it was the usual flu. When a friend called me that he had a positive test at a congress in Switzerland, I was also tested,' the archduke explained, reports Hello!. He went on to praise the Austrian authorities for ensuring 'panic is not brought in' by acting 'with measure and goal'. Karl, whoseancestral titles are Archduke of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia, revealed last week he was experiencing mild symptoms of coronavirus, including a cough, headache and 'a little fever'. He told the news outlet oe24 he was remaining 'completely alone at home', explaining: 'I have a friend who puts groceries at my door every two days.' 'I was at an event in Switzerland ten days ago, the archduke explained. 'There were also many Italians there. 'When my friend called me there a few days later and said that he had the coronavirus, I knew that I should also be tested. I was out with him for two days.' He told how he called the hotline and the following morning, the Red Cross took a sample from him. Following a positive test result, he was served a separation notice from police, instructing him to self-isolate. Karl has three children with his estranged wife Baroness Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza; model Eleonore, 26, racing driver Ferdinand Zvonimir, 22, and Gloria, 20. At its height of power, the House of Habsburg was one of the leading and most influential rulers in Europe. Charles I of Austria reigned for two years until the monarchy was abolished at the end of the First World War. The news about Karl's diagnosis comes afterQueen Letizia of Spain was given the all-clear after she was tested for the coronavirus following a kiss on the cheek with an infected government minister earlier this month. A Spanish Royal family spokesman said her husband, King Felipe VI, was also cleared after tests. The monarchs were tested late last week after it emerged a government minister former journalist Letizia had met recently had been diagnosed with the disease.She shook hands with equality minister Irene Montero at an event in Madrid. The coronavirus outbreak has affected a number of royal events, including the postponement of the Monaco royal family's annual Rose Ball and Queen Mathilde of Belgium's state visit to Italy. Last week Queen Elizabeth II'supcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden were postponed because of thepandemic. Her Majesty is expected to remain at Buckingham Palace. Earlier this month the Queen is reported to have vowed not to let the outbreak stop her from performing her duties and to set an example by 'keeping calm and carrying on' until there is 'compelling advice to the contrary'. YesterdayPrime Minister Boris Johnson warned that all people in the UK, especially the over 70s, should stop all non-essential contact and travel, which is likely to have a major impact on the working monarchy's royal duties. A Japanese state visit to the UK, the 75th anniversary of VE Day, Trooping the Colour, investitures and summer garden parties are just some of the events which are likely to be under scrutiny as to whether they will continue. A Palace spokesman said: 'We are studying the implications of the new Government advice and its impact on forthcoming events.' High-profile appearances bringing together large crowds have always been a major part of the royal family's calendar. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that the Government is no longer supporting mass gatherings. All people in the UK should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, stop all non-essential contact and travel, and work from home if they can, he said. Mr Johnson said the advice to avoid all social contact is particularly important for people over 70. The Queen is 93, while the Prince of Wales is 71 and the Duchess of Cornwall is 72. Here is a look at some of the main royal events likely to be affected: Japanese state visit to the UK British pomp and pageantry is at its best during a state visit. Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masakois are due to stay with the Queen at Windsor Castle in May, but the Foreign Office will advise the royal household whether the visit will go ahead. State visits are a huge undertaking, with hundreds of royal household staff, members of the military and police officers needed to ensure the smooth running of programmes. Key elements include a ceremonial welcome by the armed forces and a grand state banquet for 170 guests including senior royals, politicians and dignitaries. State visits have been postponed before. A stay by Spain's King Felipe in 2016 was delayed to June 2017 due to a political crisis in his country, and again to July 2017 because of the UK general election. A state visit by King Abdullah of Jordan was postponed in 2000 because of the crisis in the Middle East amid Israeli-Palestinian fighting. 75th anniversary of VE Day Mass celebrations have been planned for the 75th anniversary of VE Day in May, with elderly members of the Second World War generation encouraged to take part. Commemorations are set to include a procession down The Mall in London, a service at Westminster Abbey, a Battle of Britain memorial flight above Buckingham Palace, and street parties across the country. The Queen and the royals would normally be expected to play a key role in celebrations marking the end of the Second World War. The traditional early May bank holiday has been moved from Monday May 4 to Friday May 8 to celebrate the anniversary. Princess Beatrice's wedding Beatrice, the Duke of York's eldest daughter and the Queen's granddaughter, is preparing to marry Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi on May 29. The ceremony for 150 guests is meant to take place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in London, and the reception is planned for the garden of Buckingham Palace. Millionaire property tycoon Mr Mapelli Mozzi has dual British and Italian citizenship. Italy - the worst-hit European country - is in lockdown. Garden parties The Queen's garden parties are held between May and July. More than 8,000 guests at a time mingle on the lawns of Buckingham Palace in London or at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Although the event is outdoors, guests - many of them elderly - gather to watch the Queen go past. They also queue in tea tents and take their seats in nearby chairs, with around 27,000 cups of tea, 20,000 sandwiches and 20,000 slices of cake consumed at each party. The Invictus Games The Duke of Sussex, who is quitting as a senior royal at the end of the month, has been gearing up for his Invictus Games in The Hague, Netherlands, in May. The global competition is likely to be under threat this year because of the prospect of bringing together current and former servicemen and women from more than 20 countries. Trooping the Colour Tourists flock to see the annual celebrations for the Queen's official birthday on the second weekend in June. The Queen and other royals take part in a carriage procession, watch the event on Horse Guards Parade in central London and gather on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a celebratory flypast. It has only been cancelled once during the Queen's reign - in 1955 - due to a national rail strike. Royal Ascot According to the event's website, the Queen has never missed a Royal Ascot since acceding to the throne. It is one of the highlights of the monarch's year, and she has owned 22 winners at Ascot, including Estimate, who won the Gold Cup in 2013 - the first time in the race's 207-year history that it has been won by a reigning monarch.

Visitors are treated to a themed exhibition each year, with the 2020 display dedicated to royal animals.

71,Love in the time of corona: Engaged couples come up with clever wedding alternatives to tie the knot in spite of devastating cancelations because of the COVID-19 outbreakÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8121517/How-couples-planning-smaller-alternative-weddings-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"As the threat of coronavirus increases across the US, more and more couples are making the heartbreaking decision to cancel their March, April, and even May weddings. But some refuse to say 'I don't' â€” even if it means seriously scaling back their big days. Several couples have devised creative ways to ensure that the vows still go on, dramatically cutting down their guests lists, eating homemade cakes, and having guests take over DJ and officiating duties. Megan Griffiths and Ben Camp from Seattle initially had a guest list of 128 for their wedding this past Saturday â€” but while they still tied the knot, it was with just 20 other people. 'We were really excited to get married. And we didnâ€™t want to let this major shift in our daily life throw that off,' Megan told the Seattle Times. 'So we just committed to doing it in some way, shape or form and figuring out how to do it without putting anyone at risk, including ourselves.' They agonized over making the call, but out-of-town friends and family worried about travel helped push them toward the decision. Ultimately, they decidedto still have the ceremony but push the party back five months. Their plans still hit snags. They'd planned to hold the ceremony atGolden Gardens Park in Ballard, but thenthe Seattle Department of Parks & Recreation closed it down. They found another spot, a shelter at a beach park, and has just nearby family and close friends â€” no plus-ones â€” join them. One of their friends even officiated, while others brought sanitizer, rubber gloves, and dessert. 'We canceled basically everything,' Megan added. 'The only thing we still had were our outfits, the flowers and the pies. Everything was pulled together at the last minute.' 'It was missing a great deal of people who we loved â€” particularly my dad and my sisterâ€™s family,' she said. 'But our wedding was simple and beautiful â€¦ and nothing if not memorable.' Meanwhile,Madeline Fauntleroy, 30, and David Dougherty, Jr., 36, also overhauled their plans for their wedding, which is set to take place this coming Saturday. They were supposed to tie the knot at Chelsea Piers, with nine bridesmaids, seven groomsmen, and a live band. Instead, they'll have six people on the rooftop of their apartment for a potluck meal with a platter fromLukeâ€™s Lobster and cake made by a friend. The bride will still wear her Ines Di Santo dress and veil, and a florist is 'throwing together a bouquet.' 'Itâ€™s a surreal experience but we are so lucky amidst all of this,' she told Fox News. 'People are very sick and people are being laid off, and that is not lost on us. 'Everything that mattered one month ago â€” the food, the flowers â€” does not matter now. This is a wedding and we still have each other,' she added. 'Iâ€™m usually a pretty Type-A person and Iâ€™ve got to say, Iâ€™m now trying to let it all go and allow other people to help.' The couple is still planning to have a party at Chelsea Piers, but they've pushed it back to October. The vendors they'd hired have agreed to work with them. 'These people are tough and some may come here and think New Yorkers arenâ€™t the nicest sort, but they pull together in hard times and love always prevails,' said the bride. Jordan Walden and fiancÃ©e Rachel Wolfheimer from Fairmount, Pennsylvania adjusted to the crisis, too. They were supposed to wed atTendenza in Philadelphia on Saturday, with a large guest list of 198. But then guests started to cancel, and the couple worried about putting others in danger, they told Philadelphia magazine. 'It came down to how quickly the news was unfolding, the uncertainty of what we would potentially be exposing our grandparents to, ourselves to, our parents to â€” everyone in the room â€” in whatâ€™s supposed to be the best day of our lives,' Jordan said. 'It was not gearing up to be that way, especially when I wouldnâ€™t be able to ignore that responsibility of putting everyone potentially in a dangerous situation.' So they cancelled, and decided to turn their Friday night rehearsal dinner into the wedding. The couple had a Jewish ceremony at Boathouse Row with a 'small, intimate group,' followed by cocktails and hors dâ€™oeuvres. A family friend played DJ, and while the groom wore jeans and a blazer, the bride wore her dress. Rachel pointed out that Jordan's wedding band is engraved with the wrong date. Now the couple is planning to have their reception in several months. Just as these brave couples forge on, however, others are expressing their anger, sadness, and disappointment and cancelling their events. Lea Abergel told Hello!that she and herfiancÃ© Ruben Fellous, who live in Israel, were set to wed on March 23 â€” but thenIsrael closed its borders to people traveling from France, where much of their guests are from. 'We are devastated and heartbroken,' she said. 'I sobbed. That was more than half of our guest list. I had hoped that it would go on as most of my family live in London, but in time things got worse.' Then Israel implemented a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving from overseas, and they realized they needed to call of the nuptials. What's more, she added, 'The venue manager was happy to go ahead with the wedding. Because it was our choice to cancel, they are not willing to pay us back and we have lost 100 per cent of our fees.' Others shared stories of cancelled weddings on social media. David Zhou, a PhD student in Boston, tweeted: 'Welp itâ€™s official. All of my wedding plans have been cancelled due to COVID-19.' 'My wedding and honeymoon cruise all got cancelled due to the coronavirus. As a logical person I get why it happened, but as someone who has planned this wedding for almost two years Iâ€™m absolutely devastated,' wrote Katlyn from Florida. Guests and family member are chiming in, too. 'My cousin and his Bride to be cancelled their wedding reception just two nights ahead to keep all their guests safe, and thatâ€™s the most selfless act I have seen through these difficult times,' tweeted one woman. 'Today we cancelled my sons wedding,' wrote a parent from Orlando, Florida. 'Weâ€™ve been planning for over a year. In 24 hours 40% of our guest list cancelled for next weekend. Coronavirus has left in its wake, one crushed family [sic].' While many people are devastated, there are some who are trying to look on the bright side and keep their heads up. 'It sucks, but we're doing the right thing,' a Redditor wrote on Thursday. A wedding has all of our family, relatives, and friends in ONE place â€” how ironic would it be to put the health of all your favorite people at risk? ""I love you so much, that's why I want to endanger you to a global pandemic!""' 'We were getting the sense that our guests were starting to feel more anxious than excited,' she added. 'That's just not the atmosphere of a happy, festive, cheerful wedding.' 'Imade the same decision today,' wrote another. 'Once I made it, I felt so much better. The stress around the uncertainty was the worst part for me. I'm obviously devastated and have been crying all day but there are so many more serious and important things to consider in times like these.' 'Just cancelled our march event,' commented a third. 'It was awful and stressful, but I feel relieved not feeling responsible for asking all of our loved ones to make a risky decision.' 'Cancelled my wedding today due to coronavirus,' tweeted Zachary Cohn from Washington state. 'Was going to be March 28th. It just didn't feel responsible to ask so many people to travel and congregate in Seattle.' At least one bride who refused to cancel â€” until the decision was presumably taken out of her hands â€” took her fury out on guests who decided not to come. She ranted to friends and family on Facebook about her upcoming nuptials, which are still over a month away. 'I've spent thousands of dollars. I've been working out, budgeting, dodging family politics land mines, chased rsvps, tried my hand and both electrical and wood work, personalized gifts, answered a million emails, aaand drank lots of wine in the bathtub,' she wrote. 'So I feel justified in remind my guests thatâ€¦I don't care. If you miss my wedding because of coronavirus paranoia. You are dead to me.' It seems her friends didn't react too kindly to the threat, though: One commented that she 'hope[s] he leaves you for a nicer girl in less than a year.'"

73,No gym? No problem! Fitness trainer shares an ab- and butt-boosting at-home workout you can do in BED while quarantined during the coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8119071/Fitness-trainer-Emily-Diers-shares-BED-workout-routine-quarantine-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"As gyms around the country close amid the coronavirus pandemic, fitness lovers have no other choice to work out from home, but one trainer has proved that you don't even have to get out of bed to get toned. Emily Diers, founder of the Bodycraft fitness method in New York City, took to Instagram on Sunday to share a three-part 'Stay in Bed Workout' series for her followers to enjoy â€” and the at-home routines couldn't have come at a better time. 'If you can give yourself even a small amount of relief, you are providing relief for the collective. Breathe + move your body,' Emily, 32, captioned her first post, which is aptly set toJ. Holiday's song 'Bed.' Scroll down for video The professional dancer explained that doing the routine on a bed has multiple benefits, noting the 'comfort is invaluable and the soft surface means you have to work harder to stabilize.' The post features five videos of Emily demonstrating five different toning exercises while kneeling on top of her bed in her Brooklyn apartment. The instructor, who advises doing 30 reps of each move, starts the workout on her knees and alternates between stretching backward and bending over until she is on all fours and kicking her leg behind her. She goes on to demonstrate a series of side and back kicks before ending with a complicated move where she is balanced on one knee and one arm while pulsing her extended leg. The second video in her'Stay in Bed Workout' series focuses on the abs and glutes, and instead of using weights or an exercise band, she utilizes her pillow. 'Your core is your center of power. This is where you manage crises and approach fear from. Breathe into your third chakra and strengthen your power, then go manage anxiety with a sense of calm,' she captioned the clip, advising to do 20 reps of each move. Emily begins by lying on her back and doingspread eagle sit-ups while holding her pillow above her head. She continues the workout with bicycle kicks, crunches with one leg in the air and the other extended in front of her, and a move to work her obliques. In her third and final video, she demonstrates a series of leg lifts that she recommends doing 20 to 30 times each. She ends the workout series with two relaxing stretches. 'I made these videos to be of use, and to channel my energy into creativity and purpose,' she wrote. 'Please keep your bodies moving and please stay connected. 'Could you drop a comment below, to me or someone who needs it?' she asked. 'Given the panic around social distancing and the empty shelves, we need to reach out more proactively than we did before.Iâ€™m going to put my phone down and go for a run.' Emily's followers thanked her for the series, with one person gushing: 'We love an adaptable QUEEN.' 'TY!!!! Much appreciated. Also happy to have extra cushion under a recovering knee!!!!!' another added. Emily is also an instructor forObÃ©, anat-home fitness company that offers a variety of live and on-demand classes, ranging from dance cardio to meditation. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to rapidly spread across the country, there has been an uptick in fitness fanatics who are turning to on-demand at-home workouts and systems such as ObÃ© to stay safe. 'We're definitely seeing a lot of people quitting their gym membership and signing up for ObÃ©. We've seen three times our normal volume,' an ObÃ© spokesperson told DailyMail.com. As of Monday, they have been over 4,700 coronavirus cases in the US and approximately 93 deaths. To slow down the spread, President Donald Trump has released a series of coronavirus guidelines that calls for a lockdown of America, including the closing of restaurants and schools. 'Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread,' the president said in the White House briefing room. While his guidelines will be revisited after the initial 15-day proposal, the president warned the virus could affect American life well into the summer. 'People are talking about July, August, something like that,' Trump said. 'They could be right in that period of time where it washes through.'"
74,Coronavirus DISCO fever: Italians put on a musical laser light show from their balconies to keep their spirits up amid coronavirus quarantineÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120349/Italians-musical-laser-light-balconies.html,"Quarantined residents in an apartment block in Italy put on a musical laser light show to lift their spirits amid the coronavirus crisis. Locals in Rome leaned out of their windows to shine the colourful lights onto the apartments of their neighbours as part of a communal disco on Sunday evening, on the sixth night of lockdown. Others can be heard singing, in voices that echo around the residential complex. Italians have been confined to their apartments for just over a week, after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the nationwide lockdown on March 9. The country has been the worst affected in Europe by the Covid-19 coronavirus with at least 27,980 confirmed cases and 2,158 deaths. The local who filmed the video said: 'This was the sixth day of staying at home. We did a flash mob in the courtyard with songs and lights.' It comes after quarantined Italians took to their balconies last weekto sing the national anthem. The flash mob launched throughout Italy aimed to bring people together and try to cope with the emergency of coronavirus as the country remains on nationwide lockdown. In Milan the singing was joined by Opera singer Laura Baldassari, who leaned out of her window in heartwarming scenes. Others confined to their homes even took their musical instruments out with them to the balconies, determined to lift the mood amid the somber situation. Guitars, recorders and harps were among the instruments taken onto balconies on Friday. One quick-thinking resident even grabbed pot lids to use as make-shift cymbals. On Thursday evening,the lyrics 'We will never give up!' rang out on the streets of Casoria in the sourthern city of Naplesas locals confined to their homes sang the defiant chorus of a soccer anthem.

75,"'Men are more likely to get it, home testing kits are reliable and Vitamin C can prevent it': The coronavirus myths that went viral",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8119355/The-coronavirus-myths-went-viral.html,"As the coronavirus epidemic gathers pace, fake news and health myths have sprung up on social media, spreading further panic and confusion. The NHS is currently advising you to stay at home for up to 14 days if you have either a high temperature or a new, persistent cough. But, as doctors work around the clock to contain the outbreak and find a cure, much is unknown â€” perfect conditions for an outbreak of public misinformation. As a result, the NHS has enlisted the help of social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google, to battle the spread of 'fake news' â€” vital, as so many of the rumours start on these websites. Here we take a look at some of the most common myths to sort the fact from the hyperbole and fiction. I CAN TEST MYSELF WITH A KIT AT HOME Public Health England has warned against using 'rapid' testing kits that promise swift results in around ten minutes, compared with NHS tests that can take several hours. It says the results were found not to be reliable. HOLD YOUR BREATH TO SPOT COVID-19 People have also been told not to fall for a self-test which involves holding your breath. The Department for Health and Social Care has warned about anonymous online posts that claim to come from Japanese doctors, recommending holding your breath as a way of testing for Covid-19. The theory is that if you can hold your breath for around 20 seconds without coughing, tightness or discomfort, then this proves your lungs are functioning properly, so therefore you are not infected. However, the Department of Health says there is no basis for this claim; you should instead consult nhs.uk/coronavirus for official advice on the outbreak. IT CAN'T SPREAD IN WARM CLIMATES The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that all the evidence suggests coronavirus can be transmitted anywhere, including places with hot and humid weather. There is also no evidence to suggest that the disease can be killed by cold or snowy conditions. 'There has been some confusion regarding seasonality and coronavirus,' says Trudie Lang, a professor of global health at the University of Oxford. 'In fact, the issue is simply that when the spring and summer come along, normal cases of flu will drop off, relieving the burden on the NHS, which will be better able to deal with coronavirus.' The best way to protect yourself against Covid-19 is by frequently washing your hands â€” this removes viruses that could be on your skin and avoids infection that could occur if you then touch your mouth, nose and eyes. IBUPROFEN CAN WORSEN SYMPTOMS French authorities yesterday warned that taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs to help with coronavirus symptoms could worsen the situation. The country's health minister, Olivier Veran, a neurologist, tweeted on Saturday: 'Anti-inflammatories (such as ibuprofen, cortisone) could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you already take anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor's advice.' Dr Charlotte Warren-Gash, an associate professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, says: 'Most deaths from Covid-19 have been among older people and those with underlying health conditions. 'We already know non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should be prescribed with caution for people who have underlying health conditions. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends prescribing the lowest dose for the shortest duration to prevent adverse effects such as gastro-intestinal bleeding and cardiovascular or kidney problems. 'For Covid-19, research is needed into the effects of specific NSAIDs among people with different underlying health conditions, which takes into account the severity of infection. 'In the meantime, for treating symptoms such as fever and sore throat, it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice.' VITAMIN C CAN PREVENT THE VIRUS Vitamin C became known as a popular immune-boosting supplement after twice-Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling claimed that taking large doses of it could not only prevent the common cold but also protect against severe illnesses, including cancer and heart disease. Recent research suggests taking an average dose of 200mg of vitamin C does reduce the duration of a cold in the general population, according to a review of several dozen studies in 2013 cited by independent fact-checking charity fullfact.org. However, there was no evidence it could prevent the common cold. Similarly, there's no evidence it can prevent Covid-19. MEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO CATCH IT 'There's no evidence that one gender or racial group is more likely to be infected by the coronavirus than another,' says GP Steve Cox. 'Some of my patients also ask me if they are more likely to catch coronavirus from Chinese people â€” and the answer is No. All the data we have so far suggests that everyone is equally at risk of becoming infected. However, evidence suggests that children â€” aged 16 and under â€” are generally very mildly affected. Those most at risk of dying or developing severe cases are people with underlying health conditions, such as respiratory problems.' SALT WATER GARGLES WILL KILL THE VIRUS Gargling with warm water mixed with salt or vinegar can help to eliminate the virus, which lodges in the throat before it reaches the lungs, according to one post doing the rounds on Facebook. There is no evidence of any scientific basis to this advice, according to the independent fact-checking charity fullfact.org. The NHS does recommend that gargling with salt water can soothe a normal sore throat, but this advice does not apply to those with coronavirus, for which there is no known cure. The WHO has also said that there is no evidence that rinsing your nose with a saline solution will help to prevent infection with coronavirus. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN HAND SANITISER 'I really wouldn't recommend this,' says GP Steve Cox. 'It would be very easy to get the ingredients and proportions wrong. And there's no need â€” washing your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water is the best way of preventing the spread of this virus.' "
76,"Overseas Chinese fleeing coronavirus pandemic 'pay $30,000 for a seat' on charter planes to fly home as videos show Beijing airport filled to the brim by passengers arriving from abroad",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8120621/Chinese-fleeing-coronavirus-pay-21K-seat-videos-airport-filled-passengers.html,"Overseas Chinese are paying up to Â£21,000 for a seat on charter planes to fly home as Chinais now deemed to be a safe harbour during the escalating coronavirus pandemic. Beijing reported just one new domestic case today in comparison to 15,152 just five weeks ago while the number of deaths and infections in Europe continue to soar. New social media footage shows the Beijing Capital Airport, the country's major air hub, filled to the brim by passengers arriving from abroad yesterday after the global health crisis led dozens of countries to declare a state of emergency. Overseas Chinese students said that they felt 'scared' and 'helpless' while staying in Europe during the outbreak due to the inaction of authorities and the public. 'Being on the [Chinese] soil just made me feel safe,' one such student who has returned to China told MailOnline. While another one said: ''I felt it was dangerous to stay in the UK.' Deer Jet, a private jet charter firm, is offering to fly people from the UK to China, but at a costly price. The company is charging its customers Â£21,000 per head to board its 14-seat business plane. Deer Jet has confirmed the price with Chinese media. The luxurious flight was quickly overbooked and the firm is considering to add new journeys, a spokesperson told the Southern Metropolis Daily. Private travel agencies are also providing flights withGulfstream G550 private jets which can charge up to Â£16,000 per seat. Prices for other economy flights have risen up to Â£3,500 per ticket, almost 10 times higher than the average price from the previous year. Economy tickets for direct flights from London to Beijing have been sold out till the end of April, according to Ctrip, a Chinese travel booking website. Worried oversea students have rushed to flee the coronavirus pandemic after schools across Europe closed campuses and moved classes online to contain the spread of the virus. 'Europe now feels like China in the early stages of the outbreak,' said Lin Tiantian, a student at a private music school in Vienna, Austria. The 21-year-old Chinese student flew back to southern Chinese city Xiamen last Saturday. She told MailOnline that she was 'frightened because no one was wearing face masks in Vienna.' A 22-year-old Iranian woman who fled China with her mother is now planning to head back to Beijing after Iran became the world's third most infected country with nearly 15,000 cases and at least 853 deaths. Fatemeh Pourani, who was born and studying in Beijing, left the country with her mother on February 3 while the virus was mainly spreading around China. She said she was surprised to see how quickly COVID-19 had swept Iran soon after China. Fatemeh revealed that she plans to return to China in April when the situation becomes more stable. 'I felt like coming home the moment my phone was connected when we landed. I didn't need to be scared anymore.' Another Chinese student studying at the University of Sheffield decided to return home when he felt 'helpless as there was a lack of actions from the UK government.' 'People in the UK weren't paying much attention to the outbreak at the beginning. I felt like it was dangerous to stay in the UK,' Yao, 23, told MailOnline. 'I felt much safer once I got on the plane and saw everyone was wearing face masks and cleaning their hands.' Chiara, 20, had been studying in Milan before she headed back to Shanghai on March 3 after seeing the number of cases in Italy rapidly climbed up. 'I was relieved when I landed in Shanghai. Being on the [Chinese] soil just made me feel safe,' the design student said to MailOnline. 'But now I feel quite anxious about the situation in Italy because I don't know what would happen to my studies and my other Chinese friends who are still over there.' One UK-basedChinese entrepreneur, who calls herself Lucy, said several proposals by UK authorities and Boris Johnson caused certain degrees of panic in the Chinese community in Britain. 'For example, the contingency plans to open up a morgue in Hyde Park and the decision not to close schools or ban social gatherings,' she told MailOnline. 'Herd immunity, the new concept launched last week, caused even wider outrage. Many Chinese people accused the UK of thinking lightly of people's lives and experimenting with people's lives.' The news comes asChina has reported just one domestic case of coronavirus today but found 20 more cases imported from abroad, threatening to spoil its progress. The single case in Wuhan will boost China's view that it has 'basically curbed' the spread of the pathogen which emerged in the city last December. But the country is now concerned about an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day. In a reversal of roles, Beijing is now requiring almost all international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels. China is now focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by the containment policies, including the hard-hit airline industry. Local governments must do their utmost to ensure people return to work as soon as possible, the official China Daily said in an editorial. Many businesses are still facing labour shortages and supply-chain disruptions, it said. Meanwhile, Britain's coronavirus shutdown could last for 18 months or more while scientists scramble to find a vaccine capable of stopping the disease, scientists warn. Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced that people should stop socialising, work from home, avoid travelling and that whole households should stay in isolation if one person becomes ill. And a report by leading scientists who are advising the Government said people may need to keep up the drastic lifestyle change for 18 months or more. The Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team predicted that 260,000 people could have died if the Government hadn't changed tack yesterday and tightened its rules. Now it could limit the fatalities to fewer than 20,000 by keeping people away from each other and slowing down the spread of the virus. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
77,Maine island with 375 residents and no doctors BANS all visitors in an bid to stop coronavirus spreading thereÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8122129/Coronavirus-Maine-island-375-residents-no-doctors-BANS-visitors.html,"As the coronavirus spreads, people can't be blamed for wanting an island hideout. But one island in Maine has made it clear: Visitors are not welcome. Officials on North Haven voted Sunday to ban all visitors and seasonal residents immediately to prevent the spread of coronavirus to the island, where there not yet been any reported cases. 'People who do not reside on the island full-time may not travel to the island due to the significant increase in risk associated with the transmission of COVID-19,' the order states. Exempted from the order is travel for 'essential purposes' â€” that includes health care providers, the order said. Maine has 15 islands that are reachable only by boat or airplane and are inhabited year-round, and so far North Haven is the only one to bring in a complete ban. 'North Haven's actions speak for themselves. Other islands are considering similar actions,' said Rob Snyder from the Island Institute. 'Maine's islands are some of the oldest communities in the state, and their health response resources are already stressed.' But, he added, it's not surprising that out-of-state residents who spend summers on the island might want to escape to a place where they feel safe. 'Many people consider the islands home, whether they are residents or not, so these actions have the potential to undermine the broader community,' he said. The Mills administration is reviewing the island town's order, said Scott Ogden, spokesman for Maine Gov. Janet Mills. North Haven, which has an estimated year-round population of about 375, held its annual town meeting over the weekend and residents expressed worries about seasonal residents spreading the new coronavirus. The virus that has stricken tens of thousands around the globe causes only mild symptoms for the majority of the people who become infected but can be deadly for some, especially older adults and people with certain health conditions such as respiratory illness. Town Clerk Kathleen Macy said most residents are supportive of the strict policy. The town has an older population, and it's so small that it could be overwhelmed if people become sick. The town has only one medical clinic, and the emergency medical technicians are all volunteers. 'The board just felt like we're in a precarious situation here, perhaps a little bit more vulnerable than other places,' she said. Maine Ferry Service was operating its normal schedule Monday to the island. And there was no effort to enforce the ban on visitors. Ferry captain Abe Baggins said he feels it's reasonable for the islanders to take action to slow the spread of the virus. He recently transported some New Yorkers to the island and understands their desire for refuge. 'They see North Haven as a safe spot. But once the virus gets to the island, it's going to feel like a prison. It will spread like wildfire on the island,' he said. Josh Beverage, a fisherman, questions whether the Select Board went too far. But he understands the goal is to protect local residents at a time when people are frightened about the virus. 'It seems like a lot of panic coming from all angles,' he said on the ferry while returning from the mainland with groceries. The island's most famous resident is Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who was recovering from hip surgery on the mainland and had not seen the order, spokeswoman Victoria Bonney said Monday. Nearby Vinalhaven Island, Maine's most heavily populated offshore island, has no plans to enact a similar ban on nonresidents, but 'I'm sure most towns have thought about it,' said Town Manager Andrew Dorr. On North Haven, the town offices were flooded with calls. Most people were supportive of the unprecedented measures to protect the island, Macy said.

78,Blissfully ignorant! Big Brother contestants in Germany are set to be told about coronavirus in live episode following uproar after being kept in dark over infection,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8121203/Big-Brother-contestants-Germany-set-told-coronavirus-live-episode.html,"Big Brother contestants in Germany will be told about the coronavirus pandemic during a live episode on Tuesday night. Plans to keep the contestants in the dark unless a relative became unwell have been overturned following an uproar on social media over the decision. The group of 14 contestants, who are being housed in Cologne, are currently some of the last people to be informed about the deadly virus, reports the Guardian. The producers initially defended their decision not to enlighten the housemates and told local newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung they would only be informedin certain circumstances. But the channel which airs the reality programme - Sat.1 -has since faced backlash online from viewers who suggested it was unfair not to tell the housemates. Many took to Twitter to air their grievances over the situation, with one person writing: 'I read today that contestants on Big Brother, Germany have no idea what's going on in the outside world with the Corona Virus and TV company is debating whether to tell them! What a liberty!' While another penned: 'So are we gonna talk about how the members of Big Brother in Germany currently have no idea about the coronavirus and nobody is allowed to tell them?' A third said: 'There's people in the big brother Germany house who have been their since Feb 6th and they have no idea about coronavirus [mind blown emoji]'. Another impassioned viewer said: 'People on Big Brother Germany, Brazil, Canada haven't been told about Covid-19. 'I've read some f***ed up s***t recently but that is f***ed up.' The contestants will be told during a live episode which is set to air ahead of its regular slot at 7pm on Tuesday evening. They will be informed about the crisis and given the opportunity to ask questions as well as receiving video recordings from their loved ones at home. Show bosses have also insisted that 'special hygiene measures' have been taken to protect the contestants from getting the infection. Most of the housemates entered the show at its inception on February 6, when the global threat of coronavirus seemed unlikely and only cases in Wuhan, China were confirmed. Four more contestants were introduced to the house on March 6, just three days before the country reported its first coronavirus death. Since the show began it has only been interrupted in the same way once before, as in 2001 the American version of the show broke the news to contestants about 9/11 when one relative was presumed missing. Currently their are two other versions of Big Brother airing across the globe in Brazil, Canada where it can presumed the housemates are equally clueless. Big Brother Australia began filming inManly, Sydney, three weeks ago, however it has been pre-recorded for the first time ever and their is no set airdate. According to The Australian, Channel Seven has chosen not to tell the contestants about the health crisis while they're in self-isolation. Coronavirus was confirmed as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11. The first case in Australia was reported in January. The Big Brother set is possibly one of the safest quarantine zones in Sydney. The housemates are in total isolation in apurpose-built compound, which is understood to be well supplied with food and essentials. They aren't told aboutmajor news events until after they've been eliminated. Australia has more than 300 confirmed coronavirus cases, including five deaths, as of Monday afternoon. Of the five deaths, four were in New South Wales, where Big Brother is being filmed. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Seven for comment. Big Brother Australia, which is beingpre-recorded for the first time in its history, has no confirmed airdate. Seven's programming chief Angus Ross toldTV Tonightin January that the reality show would likely launch before the Olympics in July. Despite no longer being a live format, viewers can still vote for their preferred winner, but it's unclear ifthere will be a live finale like previous seasons. Big Brother contests aren't the only people who have been left unaware of the pandemic. Jared Leto has been left stunned after emerging from a12-day desert retreat to discover the spread of coronavirus has now become a global pandemic. The Oscar winner, 48, was shocked to learn that much of the world was taking extreme measures to fight COVID-19, with countless people self-isolating at home."
79,Star Wars and Jurassic World filming is 'SUSPENDED after Pinewood Studios send staff home for at least a month' amid coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8121943/Star-Wars-Jurassic-World-filming-SUSPENDED-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"Filming for Star Wars and Jurassic World is said to have been temporarily suspended amid the coronaviruspandemic. Shooting had begun at Pinewood Studios for the Star Wars Disney+ spin-off starring Obi-Wan Kenobi andJurassic World: Dominion. However it was reported on Tuesday, staff have been sent home for at least a month after Boris Johnson announced Britons should work from home, stop non-essential travel and contact with others. A source told The Sun: 'Filming just stopped today and everyone at Pinewood was sent home. 'Staff are being told the site will now be closed for 30 days starting from next Monday.' A spokesperson for Pinewood Studios told the publication: 'Pinewood Group are continuing to follow guidance set out by the Government, and the studios remain fully operational.' MailOnline has contacted Pinewood Studios for comment. Since its beginning, Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire has been the location for many well-known films, with the long-running James Bond and Carry On British film series making Pinewood their home. Jurassic Park has been filming since February, and the studio will determine when to resume production in the coming weeks. It's unknown when the production was scheduled to end or if the hiatus will delay its June 21 release date. Dominion brings back Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, as well as Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill, who are reprising their roles from the original 1993 film Jurassic Park. Disney will also temporarily 'pause production' on a slew of its live-action films as a result of the growing coronavirus threat. 'We have made the decision to pause production on some of our live-action films for a short time,' announced a Disney representative in a statement released Friday. Although 'there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19' on Disney sets, the halt comes as a result of the company 'considering the current environment and the best interests' of cast and crew. Projects currently suspended include the live-action The Little Mermaid. The UK's TV, film and entertainment industry is at breaking point amid the coronavirus pandemic, with production on major shows and movies shut down. Live shows such as ITV's Loose Women and The Jeremy Vine Show have been shooting without a studio audience, while filming across the UK has been halted for major programmes such as Line Of Duty and Peaky Blinders. It was also confirmed on Tuesday that theBAFTA Television Craft Awards and Virgin Media British Academy Television Awards, originally scheduled for 26 April & 17 May, will be postponed. Cases of the coronavirus across the UK have now risen to 1,543, with 55 deaths; but there is likely to be many more as tests are being carried out on patients in hospital. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready."
80,"So much for social distancing! Penny Lancaster celebrates her 49th birthday with friends in Las Vegas before going into self-isolation with Rod Stewart, 75",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8120451/Penny-Lancaster-celebrates-49th-birthday-Rod-75-Vegas.html,"Penny Lancaster enjoyed one final hurrah with her friends on Monday night as she celebrated her 49th birthday. The former model brought her loved ones including husband Sir Rod Stewart, 75, together in Las Vegas for a lavish dinner party before jetting back to the UK and going into self-isolation. The move comes as the UK government placed a mandatory quarantine on citizens aged 70 plus from next weekend, meaning that Rod will have to be holed up at home for months. Penny was seen wearing a gorgeous red dress, raising a glass as she toasted to another year with her nearest and dearest. She shared: 'Thanks to all our friends for coming together to celebrate my birthday during the most unprecedented time we have known. 'Together we stand, together we give thanks and although this might be one of the last get togethers for a while letâ€™s pray we all remain safe and healthy.' One person commented: 'Happy Birthday Penny, stay safe you, Sir Rod, family and friends xxxx'. Another shared, 'Happiest of birthdays to you!! Safe flight back home. Sending you a big hug'. 'Happy birthday Penny you look amazing please wrap Rod in cotton wool for the next few months', a third wrote. Two days earlier, the blonde beauty revealed that Rod's concerts in Las Vegas had been postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Sharing a snap of them together, she wrote: 'Rods last show in Vegas tonight as the shows next week have been postponed due to the coronavirus.' The government plunged Britain into an extraordinary lockdown this week - urging everyone in the country to stop all 'non-essential' contact with others. The PM warned that the coronavirus was now in a phase of rapid spread across the UK, with London seeing a particular surge, and it was time to take radical action to stop the NHS being swamped. Everyone should avoid contact that is not absolutely necessary - with restaurants, bars and cinemas and travel off limits, and an end to large gatherings. Admitting that the squeeze could last 12 weeks or even longer, Mr Johnson acknowledged he was 'asking a lot'. Entire households should self-isolate for two weeks if one person has been showing symptoms, and older people should prepare to stay away from risks for months to come. He said that meant 'you should not go out, even to buy food or essentials'. But unlike New York - where all bars and restaurants have been compelled to close by 8pm local time tonight - Mr Johnson said he would rely on businesses and Britons to follow guidance. Boris also said he was not yet ordering schools to be closed, saying he still believed it could make matters worse. At a dramatic press conference in Downing Street, as the UK coronavirus death toll spiked to 55, the PM said: 'If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. If that is not possible, you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies.' 'Now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and stop all non-essential travel. We need people to start working from home where they possible can. You should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues.' In a special plea to the capital, Boris said people there were at the highest risk. 'It looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead... it's important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding all non-essential contact.' The move came after ministers were warned the death toll from the virus could hit 260,000 unless dramatic measures were taken immediately."

Adrian Goldthorpe travelled from London Heathrow to Han Oi on Monday 9 March. On Friday Mr Goldthorpe, along with 10 others flew to Da Nan and visited some sites before arriving at a hotel. The 68-year-old was then informed by their guide that one of the cabin crew on the flight had been tested positive for Covid-19. The finance director from Leeds was then taken to a hotel with eight others, who were then told medical staff would come and test them. Since Friday more Brits have arrived, one of which has tested positive for Covid-19, Mr Goldthorpe has said he is today waiting to be moved out of the complex he is and into another. Vietnam has reported 61 infections from the illness but no deaths and all 16 of its virus sufferers have recovered. The country today announced that it would be suspending the issue of new visas for all foreign nationals to curb the spread of coronavirus. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Goldthorpe said it wasn't until 10pm on Friday that they were told to pack their bags and head to the reception. 'There were three heavily protected individuals who loaded our things and us into a minibus type ambulance. We went with speed, lights flashing etc, picking up two others on the way. 'We arrived at what can only be described as a disused, dilapidated, army facility that before the victory by the North, had been a hotel. 'We were temperature tested and led to an old classroom turned into a dormitory. There were steel army bunks with no mattresses. Another group of nine British had arrived an hour before us and were erecting their mosquito nets on the bottom bunks which they had claimed'. They were told to find somewhere else to sleep, but eventually managed to persuade the guards to find them somewhere else, which was another disused classroom with the same bunks in it. Mr Goldthorpe, who was travelling with holiday group Exodus, said the group tried their best to sleep but that there were no matresses on the bunks. 'There was a table with toilet paper, small cartons of milk, dried noodles, tea bags and NescafÃ© all in one. Why the latter, I have no idea as there was no hot water. 'We were then left to our own devices with no information. We have been given breakfast, of a sort from a local hotel. They have also brought us a couple of kettles. The guards are very responsive to our needs, now. 'We have had swabs and blood samples taken. We were all temperature tested and proved to be of normal temperature'. On Saturday they managed to use a makeshift shower made out of a hosepipe. Later that night they 11 more arrived meaning they were self isolating with the new arrivals. Mr Goldthorpe said that at this point there was 'still only one toilet and no showers and only cold water between 27, including a baby'. 'Still very little information being given to us. We are trying our best to keep our spirits up, however, it is difficult'.  Send us your stories - email Terri-Ann.Williams@mailonline.co.uk or tips@dailymail.com On Sunday portaloos arrived and Mr Goldthorpe said the group was very supportive of each other and claimed it had been a difficult task. Just yesterday he said one member of the group tested positive for the disease while everyone else got the news that they were negative. He said there is still no water and that the toilets are 'soiled' and that there is no hand washing provisions. 'We keep getting everywhere sprayed with some chemicals. We have no idea what this is and could be harmful. This is very worrying'. Yesterday the group were told that they were being moved to the building next door. It is not yet clear whether or not Mr Goldthorpe had been able to move hotels today, but he said that they were asked to leave their rooms so they could be sprayed. Alec Shelbrooke, Mr Goldthorpe's local MP said he was in contact with his constituent and that the Foreign and Commonwealth office is working urgently to support UK nationals in Vietnam. An FCO spokesperson said: 'We recognise that any British people currently overseas may be nervous about the impact of coronavirus on their travel and their health. 'We are in close contact with travel providers and our international partners to provide support to those British people affected by ongoing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.'

The weed suppliers will now be open for takeaway purchases during Holland's virus lockdown after a Dutch government U-turn on Monday night. Cannabis smokers had queued around the block to stockpile cannabis when the ban was initially announced on Sunday, putting a twist on the usual search for pasta and toilet paper. However, another Dutch institution - the sex clubs and brothels of Amsterdam's red-light district - will remain closed until April 6. The coffee shops were re-opening today after the Dutch government revised its quarantine measures on Monday night. Authorities feared that closing the coffee shops completely would promote the drug trade on the streets. However, consuming cannabis at the cafes themselves - which often have a special ventilated room for customers to smoke their joints - will be banned during the lockdown. The queues built up within minutes on Sunday after the Dutch health and education ministers gave a televised press conference announcing the closure of many businesses, along with all Dutch schools. Customers in Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Utrecht and the Hague lined up in their dozens to stock up for what could be a lengthy quarantine. 'For maybe for the next two months we're not able to get some weed so it should be nice to at least have some in the house,' one cannabis buyer in the Hague said. 'My friend called me like five minutes ago, he saw the press conference - good friend,' the Dutch shopper called Jonathan said. 'I wouldn't mind having a little bit of weed - keep it easy while we're at home for so long. It might be a long time in quarantine,' said an Irish woman who gave her name as Hannah as she queued in the Hague. 'I was literally just watching the press conference with my flatmate and then I just went downstairs and suddenly there's this queue of like 30 people, and all these cars arriving as well now.' Separate queues also built up at Roermond near the border with Germany, amid fears that the German government would shut its borders with the Netherlands next. Germany has already introduced strict controls for those arriving from France, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Denmark from Monday. Cannabis is technically illegal in the Netherlands, but it decriminalised the possession of less than 0.18 ounces in 1976 under a so-called 'tolerance' policy. Dutch health officials said today that the country's coronavirus death toll had nearly doubled overnight to 43, while 1,705 people have now been infected."

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 55, took to Twitter on Tuesday to commend the actor, 47, for speaking about COVID-19, telling him to 'take care and stay strong'. Idris revealed on Monday he had been tested positive for coronavirus and that he and his wife Sabrina Dhowre, 29, have gone into self isolation. Dr Tedros wrote:'Take care and stay strong,@idriselba! I admire your brave and powerful message to the world. We're all in this together. Solidarity will beat the #coronavirus. #COVID19.' Idris said in his video message he'feels ok' and has no symptoms but has decided to self-isolate following his exposure to COVID-19. The Luther starhad attended theWE Day UK Charity event and concert in London last Tuesday March 3 with Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. She announced she tested positive for the virus last week and gone into self quarantine. Idris shared the video with the caption: 'This morning I tested positive for Covid 19. 'I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. 'Stay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how Iâ€™m doing. No panic.' Idris confirmed wife Sabrina had not yet been tested but said that she also 'feels ok' at the moment. The Luther star addedhe only got tested after coming into contact with someone who later confirmed that they had coronavirus, before quarantining himself and getting tested 'immediately'. He received the news of his results this morning. 'Look, this is serious,' he continued. 'Now is the time to start thinking about social distancing, washing your hands. Beyond that there are people out there who aren't showing symptoms, and that can easily spread it. 'So now is the time to be really vigilant about washing your hands, and keeping your distance.' The pair have also told their families and colleagues. Idris finished the clip by saying 'stay positive and don't freak out'. Fans were quick to share their best wishes with the star, praising him for using his platform to encourage people to take more precautions. Actress Ava DuVernay wrote: 'Thank you, @idriselba, for using your platform to educate and inform. No symptoms, but positive.' But others were quick to point out that his wife Sabrina should have separated herself, as she had not yet been tested for the virus. Another follower commented: 'If you are positive, and Sabrina has not been tested then why are you anywhere near her?' The news comes a week after Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for the novelcoronavirusduring a holiday to the Gold Coastin Australia. The Forrest Gump actor and his wife, both 63, announced the positive test results on Instagram urging the public to 'take care'. Hanks revealed they had experienced symptoms including the common cold, body aches and chills before they decided to get tested. Before their diagnosis, the couple had visited crowded Australian hotspots including Bondi Beach and the Sydney Opera House - raising fears that others were infected. The opera house have been trying to track down 207 people who could have come into contact with the couple at a concert on Saturday night. And on Sunday night, former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko announced she had tested positive for the now-widespread virus. The 40-year-old, who playedCamille Montes in 2008's Quantum of Solace, said she was diagnosed after feeling 'ill for almost a week' with fever and fatigue. She is now facing days in isolation and posted a picture of her locked window on Instagram last night as she revealed she was 'locked up at home'. The Soviet-born actress added: 'Fever and fatigue are my main symptoms. Take care of yourself and do take this seriously!'"

Patrons of the sprawling seven-storey 'entertainment venue' are given scans to detect fevers, one of the symptoms of the bug whichhas infected more than140 people in the country. Patrons must also use hand sanitizer upon entering The Bank club in the city- where prices start at 2,400 baht (Â£60) for 90 minutes with a girl. Thailand has reported one death from coronavirus which has killed more than 7,000 people world wide. Footage from inside the brothel shows staff wiping down the surfaces in the reception area where girls - who all have coronavirus medical insurance - wait in colourful evening dresses for customers. Upstairs in the 'five star rooms', all of the beds, Jacuzzis, saunas and karaoke microphones are constantly cleaned throughout the day. The club claims it is the first in the world to introduce such measures. More than 200 staff work in the club and have all been tested and cleared for coronavirus. Head of customer service at the venue Sineenath Jantasing said the escorts also receive thermal scans before they start their shifts. She added: ''We take good care of our hostesses. We use alcohol hand sanitiser and do temperature checks for good hygiene. 'Both sides, the customers and the hostesses, will be confident that they are safe visiting here during the pandemic. 'All the staff here know about Covid-19 protection because we have trained them so well.' Earlier this month the upmarket venue introduced its own branding on bottles of alcohol-based hand sanitiser gel. The operators of the club, one of the biggest in Bangkok, were also praised by the officials from the country's Ministry of Health. Staff from the government's Department of Disease Control visited the building and met workers who are helping to sterilise the environment."
85,Adorable videos show penguins happily roaming around an empty aquarium in Chicago after it was shut down to the public,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8121611/Coronavirus-Internet-delighted-video-penguins-roaming-Chicago-aquarium.html,"In the midst of all the scary and upsetting news about the coronavirus pandemic, two penguins are helping to bring some much-needed joy and comfort to those quarantined at home. Edward and Annie, two bonded rockhopper penguins living at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, have become unlikely viral stars after staff at the tourist attraction shared a Facebook video of the two birds roaming freely around the facility, which was shut down to the public on Friday. In the adorable clip, which has racked up more than 1.6 million views, the two birds are seen waddling past several different exhibitions, viewing some of the fish in their tanks, and even strutting through the aquarium's main entrance. 'This morning, Edward and Annie explored the rotunda,' the caption on the video explained. 'They are a bonded pair of rockhopper penguins, which means they are together for nesting season. Every spring is nesting season for the penguins here at Shedd, and this year is no different!' In the clip, the two birds are seen happily wandering around the empty building, remaining close together during their exploration, which saw them being given a chance to meet several of the other forms of wildlife living in the aquarium with them. 'Without guests in the building, caretakers are getting creative in how they provide enrichment to animals, introducing new experiences, activities, foods and more to keep them active, encourage them to explore, problem-solve and express natural behaviors,' a spokesperson for the Shedd told the Chicago Tribune. The happy video sparked an outpouring of sweet comments from viewers, with many people thanking the aquarium staffers for providing them with some light relief during these troubling and fearful times. 'This is awesome!' one person wrote. 'Great way to take advantage of a bad situation w/the coronavirus outbreak. 'I wish other cute zoo animals could explore out of their habitats like these lucky birds. Thank you for sharing! My daughter and I are self quarantined at home and this was so cool to share w/her.' Another person chimed in to request more of the same content, writing: 'More penguin vids, and throw in some otters! This just made my c****y day better. Thank you, Shedd!' 'Thank you so much for sharing these!' a third person wrote. 'Please keep them coming! A much needed bright spot with everything else going on in the world.' Edward and Annie are not the only penguins to have been given a starring role on the Shedd Aquarium's Facebook page; on Sunday, staffers shared another video of Wellington, another penguin at the facility, who was given the chance to explore the Amazon exhibit. 'Penguins in the Amazon?! Some of the penguins went on a field trip to meet other animals at Shedd,' the caption read. 'Wellington seemed most interested in the fishes in Amazon Rising! 'The black-barred silver dollars also seemed interested in their unusual visitor.' Staffers also reassured those people requesting more video content from the penguins that there will be plenty more footage to watch over the coming weeks. 'Next week, penguins, including Edward and Annie, will begin to build their nests,' the video caption read. 'Youâ€™re invited to digitally join us for the nesting coverage! 'In the meantime, we will share a variety of animal activities, and yes, Wellington will return! While this may be a strange time for us, these days are relatively normal for the penguins and other animals at Shedd. 'Our caregivers are constantly providing new activities, experiences, food and more to allow the animals to express natural behaviorsâ€”even if that includes simply exploring. Let us know what penguin activities you want to see!'"

Kozo Tashima announced he had a 'mild fever' and a 'symptom of pneumonia' but was feeling 'fine' and would 'concentrate on treatment'. Tashima had recently returned from a nine-day business trip in which he travelled to Northern Ireland, Holland and the United States - saying 'everyone was still doing hugs and handshakes' at the time. The news comes amid growing doubts over whether the Tokyo 2020 Games can go ahead at all because of the growing pandemic. 'Today, my test result showed positive for the new coronavirus,' Tashima said in a statement, issued via the Japan Football Association which he also heads. 'I have a mild fever. Examinations showed a symptom of pneumonia, but I'm fine. I will concentrate on treatment following doctors' advice,' he said. Tashima said he had been on a business trip since February 28, first heading to Belfast to attend a meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB). From March 2, he visited Amsterdam for a UEFA meeting to give a presentation on Japan's bid for the 2023 women's World Cup. And on March 3, he attended a general meeting of the same body. 'In Amsterdam and in Europe in early March, the level of nervousness against the novel coronavirus was not the same as now,' he said in the statement. 'Everyone was still doing hugs, handshakes and bises (cheek kissing).' He then travelled to the United States to watch the Japanese women's team in action and to lobby for the women's World Cup, before returning home on March 8. 'In the United States, too, the sense of crisis about the novel coronavirus was not as serious as now,' he said. The crisis in Europe has mushroomed in recent days, with travel restrictions still minimal in early March. Staff at the Japan FA have been working from home as a precaution against the virus, but Tashima said he went to the association building several times last week and attended meetings. He began feeling chills and experienced a mild fever from Sunday. He went to a local public health centre on Monday and told them about his travel history. During the UEFA gatherings, Tashima said he saw Swiss and Serbian football chiefs, who have tested positive for the virus, although he added it was not clear how he contracted the infection. His positive test came out on Tuesday. 'I have chosen to face the illness as so many people are doing in Japan and around the world,' he said, adding that he hoped his decision would help eradicate the stigma attached to the infection. Japanese officials are insistent that the Olympics will go ahead as planned with an opening ceremony on July 24. International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach also wants to go ahead but says the body will follow WHO guidelines. The Tokyo 2020 organising committee has already been forced to scale down festivities related to the Olympic torch relay to prevent further spread of the virus. The flame, which has already been lit in Greece, will arrive in northern Japan on Friday, with the torch relay slated to start on March 26 from Fukushima. There have also reportedly been discussions about staging the Games in front of empty stadiums. Most major sporting events have been called off because of the virus, including football's Premier League, golf's Masters and motor racing's Formula One season."
87,How to work from home with your partner and NOT get divorced! Experts reveal the survival tricks your relationship needs - including drawing up physical boundariesÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8117563/Is-self-isolating-strain-relationship.html,"People are staying at home and self-isolating in a bid to protect themselves against coronavirus, butwhat happens when you are forced to spend 24 hours a day with your partner for weeks on end? Divorce requests in China reportedly rose significantly after couples spent 'too much time together at home' during coronavirus self-isolation, according to register offices across the country. As homes across the UK rapidly become shared working spaces, how do you get through it and emerge with your relationship intact? FEMAIL has spoken to a life coach and emotional health advisor on how to live harmoniously while spending more time at home. Here they reveal why allotting designated work spaces, spending time apart and creating date nights can help to keep you both sane. 1. Establish your physical 'work boundaries' While some have the luxury of a desk each, not everyone has the space or budget to incorporate this. Sitting at the kitchen table together could result in tensions created by a clash of laptops, phones and paperwork. Life coach Amana Walker said: 'Agree your ""work boundary"" with your partner as soon as possible. 'If you leave it too long you will start to get in each other's way and tension will build.' She added how couples should outline which areas in the home, such as the kitchen table, bedroom or lounge could be used as a work space. Amana added: 'Be disciplined about keeping work items tidy and have a rule that you both clear them to one side at the end of the day, so that you can distinguish between work time and home time.' 2. Create date nights When spending long periods of time with each other there is no longer an opportunity to miss your partner or save up stories to discuss at the end of the day. Putting the spark back into your relationship while at home can be tough, especially while in close proximity every day. Amana said: 'If you're able, plan date nights so you can have time away from your usual surroundings. 'Go for a walk together at lunchtime or at weekends.' Couples should inject an element of surprise into their relationship by complimenting each other, cooking dinner and taking pride in appearance. 3.Take breaks away from each other Spending 24/7 with a partner could cause tiny issues to become magnified while in each other's company. Personal space is key to ensuring you are not suffocated while isolating at home. Amana stresses the importance of staying in contact with friends via group chats. She added how by sharing the challenges of 'isolation' with others it could make you feel less alone. She also advised people to take sufficient breaks from their partner which could include a bath or reading a book. 'If you need fresh air, take a walk to the shops to get a snack/coffee. 'If you can't do that, at least take a break away from your partner and allow yourself a bit of quiet time.' 4. Communicating how you feel Self-isolating can lead people to feel bored, agitated and even frustrated as they have no option but to remain at home. It is important for people to recognise these feelings before simply projecting them onto someone else, emotional health advisorâ£â£â£â£ RoxieNafousi explained. She said: 'Take ten deep breaths, meditate, or write down your feelings in a journal. 'Own your emotions and feelings and work through them as best you can. 'Tell your partner how you are feeling. Saying, 'I'm feeling a bit frustrated, I need a moment to myself"", is going to allow your partner to understand you better, and not assume you are annoyed at them. 'Also, make sure to ask them how they are and check in with them.' 5. Being grateful Acknowledging when your partner does something thoughtful could make for a happier working and living environment. Small acts of kindness such as emptying the dishwasher, giving a compliment and being flexible with each other could offer support during a time of uncertainty. Roxie said: 'Simply saying ""thank you"" is both a kind thing to do and reminds you both of the love you share.'"

Yet Chris Martin kept fans spirits up as self-isolation is advised across the globe, by playing a virtual concert as part of the Together, At Home initiative. The Coldplay frontman, 43, treated the band's Instagram followers to a live session, where he played some of the group's biggest hits as well as a selection of covers. Chris also chatted about his life and experience with Coldplay, as well as taking requests and answering some of his fans questions. After playing his track A Sky Full of Stars, Chris said: 'When I first played that song to the rest of the band, you can understand why Will our drummer went 'yeah it's alright' because it didn't sound great' He also mused: 'Where is everyone calling from? I see an Australian flag, that emoji with the hearts, not sure what that's called - but thank you!' Chris then began looking out for people's song requests and said: 'Trouble! Viva la Vida! They're coming in thick and fast. We have a new song which I'm not supposed to tell you about, so I won't.' Together, at Home was organised between the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Global Citizen, which aims to raise $675 million towards COVID-19 relief. After playing his mini-concert, Chris revealed that his friend and fellow musician John Legend would be performing his own concert next. He said: 'You can see a real piano player who doesn't need fireworks to play.' Earlier in the day Chris advertised his free virtual concert with a post on the account's Instagram story, which read: 'Hello everyone. I hope you and your family are safe and healthy. If anyone feels like chatting and listening to some music, I'm going to do a livestream on our Instagram in about 25 mins (1pm LA/ 8pm in London) love CM. #togetherathome.'"
89,"Meet the Green Goddess Gang! From Jackie-O and Angelina Jolie to Boris Johnson's fiancee, emerald engagement rings have become the go-to sparkler for brides-to-be, but history suggests receiving one may set you on a rocky marital road...",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8119005/From-Carrie-Symonds-Angelina-Jolie-emeralds-never-stylish.html,"Hand held up oh-so-casually as she swept her hair behind her ear, Carrie Symonds's ring was on display for all to see as she made her first appearance since announcing her engagement to the Prime Minister. And who could have missed it? A large emerald surrounded by petal-shaped diamonds, it is believed to be an antique worth Â£30,000. Yet emeralds aren't all they seem. Jewellers warn that they're more prone to scratches and fractures as they are softer than other gems. The stones are also thought to be unlucky by many, and are mired in myth and superstition. In ancient cultures, emeralds â€” which symbolise wit, power and wealth â€” were thought to have strange powers. Cleopatra believed they would ward off serpents, but died from a poisonous snake bite. From Wallis Simpson to Angelina Jolie, SARAH RAINEY looks at the emerald wearers whose gorgeous rings heralded a not-so-happily ever after . . . SHOWY RING WAS TOO MUCH FOR JACKIE O Jackie Bouvier looked at 'dozens' of engagement rings after Senator John F. Kennedy proposed in 1953, eventually choosing one featuring a 2.84-carat emerald and a 2.88-carat diamond, from New York jeweller Van Cleef & Arpels. Jackie rarely wore the ring or, when she did, covered it up with a glove, suggesting she thought it too flamboyant. In 1961, she had it redesigned, commissioning a wreath of marquise-cut diamonds around the two central stones. Afterwards, she wore the ring more regularly, including during an outing with her husband on November 22, 1963 . . . when he was shot dead as she sat beside him in the presidential motorcade through Dallas, Texas. DOOMED LOVE OF CHILD STAR During a tempestuous relationship, Russian billionaire Egor Tarabasov gave Parent Trap actress Lindsay Lohan a Â£225,000 cushion-cut emerald engagement ring. The pair â€” who had dated for nine months â€” separated in August 2016 after disturbing photographs showed the Russian playboy apparently assaulting Lindsay, now 33, on a Greek beach. She continued to wear the ring for several months afterwards, with friends describing it as her 'severance package'. CARTIER'S FINEST FOR 'THAT WOMAN' Rebellious by reputation, it was perhaps no surprise the Duke of Windsor proposed to U.S. divorcee Wallis Simpson in October 1936 with an emerald ring. Commissioned from French jeweller Cartier, the dazzling ring featured a 19.77-carat green stone flanked by diamonds, and was engraved with the message: 'We are ours now.' Their love lasted â€” in fact, Wallis had the ring remounted to celebrate their 20th anniversary in 1956. ENGAGEMENT ENDED AMID CHEAT GOSSIP Russian supermodel Irina Shayk, 34, debuted her engagement ring â€” a rich green emerald, surrounded by white pear-cut diamonds â€” in 2016, shortly after announcing she was expecting a child by Hollywood star Bradley Cooper. The pair had a daughter, Lea de Seine, in March 2017, but separated last year amid rumours â€” which they denied â€” that he was cheating on her with Lady Gaga, his co-star in A Star Is Born. BLING LASTED LONGER THAN BRANGELINA Brad Pitt missed the mark when he proposed to emerald-lover Angelina Jolie in 2012, eschewing her favourite stone for a white diamond. But she made up for it during their relationship, donning emerald rings for countless red carpet occasions. A memorable outing was the 2009 Oscars, when she dazzled onlookers in a 65-carat Colombian emerald ring, worth almost Â£800,000. Two years later, at the Golden Globes, she donned a 27-carat emerald set in rose gold on the ring finger of her right hand. When she and Brad separated in 2016, Angelina requested 'miscellaneous jewellery' as part of the divorce settlement, showing her attachment to the ill-fated gems. FIERY PASSION THAT BURNT OUT Elizabeth Taylor's emerald ring wasn't technically an engagement gift from lover Richard Burton but part of a suite of expensive green stones from Italian jeweller Bulgari, bought in Rome at the height of their illicit affair during the filming of Cleopatra in 1962. The couple would sneak into the boutique via a secret entrance for covert shopping trips â€” both were married. 'I used to get so excited, I would jump on top of him and practically make love to him in Bulgari,' Taylor said in an interview in 2002. But their fiery passion was not destined to last â€” after marrying in 1964, they divorced in 1974 and reunited briefly in 1975, only to fight so much that they separated again after less than a year. KNOCK-OUT BLOW FOR HILARY'S BEAU Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank, 45, proudly announced her engagement to former professional tennis player Ruben Torres in March 2016, sharing images of her sparkling emerald ring on her Twitter and Instagram accounts. But just three months later, the ring was off â€” along with the engagement â€” as Million Dollar Baby star Hilary, appeared solo at the French Open (and quietly deleted her social media posts). BOND GIRL'S SECRET CODE Bond actress Halle Berry's third husband, French actor Olivier Martinez, proposed to her in 2012 with a four-carat emerald, set between two diamonds on an 18-carat gold band. He reportedly asked Parisian jeweller Robert Mazlo to produce 'the most beautiful ring ever made'. Mazlo later explained: 'The ring is textured and contains codes and symbols which you cannot see â€” only the person wearing it can.' However, the emerald, which had come from an ancient mine in Muzo, Colombia, seemed doomed from the start. Halle, 53, lost it in 2014 while filming in Mexico and the couple, who had married and had a baby son in 2013, were 'too busy' to replace it. The following year, they announced they were divorcing. P.S. THEY WEREN'T UNLUCKY FOR US Not all emerald engagement rings have spelled bad luck for their wearers, however, or their marriages. Queen Victoria, who was happily married to Prince Albert for 21 years until his death, wore an unusual emerald serpent ring, while the Queen's grandmother, Princess Mary of Teck, had a square-cut emerald ring to mark her marriage to Viscount Lascelles in 1922. Victoria Beckham has not one but 14 engagement rings, all gifted by besotted husband David during their 20-year marriage. Her seventh is a cushion-cut emerald inside a spiral of diamonds, first spotted in 2007 and twice again at the Oscars in 2009 and 2012. Guardians Of The Galaxy actress Zoe Saldana is another emerald-lover, sporting a pear-shaped green stone on her ring finger after secretly marrying her Italian artist boyfriend Marco Perego in 2013. The couple now have three sons, including twins, together."

The ceremony took place via video link on Monday after the live event in LA was cancelled amid coronavirus concerns. The results capped a dismal performance for the big screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit stage show Cats. The six Razzie awards for Cats included supporting actor wins for James Corden and Rebel Wilson. Tom Hooper was named worst director. The movie, with an all-star cast including Judi Dench, Taylor Swift and Idris Elba, who were costumed in digitally-produced fur, was ridiculed by critics and proved a box office flop, taking in just $70 million. The tongue-in-cheek Razzies, or Golden Raspberries, were created in 1980 as an antidote to HollywoodÂ´s awards season. Nominees were announced in February, a day before the Oscars, the highest honors in the movie industry.

91,SpaceX halts rocket launch at the LAST second before lift-off when its auto-abort computer detected an engine issueÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8118305/SpaceX-halts-rocket-launch-second-auto-abort-computer-detected-engine-issue.html,"SpaceX aborted the launch of its Falcon 9 rocket on March 15 at the last second due to an engine issue. During the livestream, an operator counts down from 10 and enthusiastically shouts 'liftoff', but quickly says 'disregard, we have an abort.' The rocket's onboard computer triggered the shutdown moments before the scheduled 9:22 AM EDT takeoff after detecting an issue with one of the engines. SpaceX later tweet: 'Standing down today; standard auto-abort triggered due to out-of-family data during engine power check.' The firm is set to announce the next launch date of the Falcon 9 that is sending another 60 Starlink satellites into orbit 'once confirmed on the range.' Scroll down for video The Falcon 9 was set to takeoff on Sunday, which had favorable weather for the mission â€“ the sky cleared up and the sun was out in full force minutes before the countdown began. Towards the end of the 10 second countdown, the rockets engine powered on, but at the final moment they quickly shutdown when the abort was automatically triggered, reports Space.com. Michael Andrews, a SpaceX supply chain manager, said during launch commentary:' We had a condition regarding engine power that caused us to abort today's launch.' 'Prior to that the countdown was proceeding normally.' 'Keep in mind, the purpose of the countdown is to help us catch potential issues prior to flight.' The Falcon 9 was designed with safety features that detect technical issues and can automatically abort a mission before it is too late. 'There are a thousand ways a launch can go wrong, but only one way the launch can go right,' Andrews said. 'Given that, we are overly cautious on the ground, and if the team sees anything that looks even slightly off, we'll stop the countdown.' SpaceX, which was founded in 2002, has had its fair shares of bumps in the road when it comes to launching its rockets according to Bloomberg. On September 1, 2016, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket suffered a catastrophic explosion on the Cape Canaveral launch pad during a routine pre-launch check. The blast, which shook buildings and windows miles away, occurred shortly after 9am and destroyed Facebook's $200 million Amos-6 satellite that was set to launch on Saturday morning aboard the reusable rocket. Just last month another the prototype of SpaceX's next-generation Starship rocket failed to contain liquid nitrogen during its latest phase of testing. The rocket exploded, sending the stainless steel cylinder flying off its stand and crashing. And there were about a handful of other missteps in between. Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched the fifth batch of its'Starlink' space internet satellites - taking the total to 300. They form a constellation of thousands of satellites, designed to provide low-cost broadband internet service from low Earth orbit. The constellation, informally known as Starlink, and under development at SpaceX's facilities in Redmond, Washington. Its goal is to beam superfast internet into your home from space. While satellite internet has been around for a while, it has suffered from high latency and unreliable connections. Starlink is different. SpaceX says putting a 'constellation' of satellites in low earth orbit would provide high-speed, cable-like internet all over the world. The billionaire's company wants to create the global system to help it generate more cash. Musk has previously said the venture could give three billion people who currently do not have access to the internet a cheap way of getting online. It could also help fund a future city on Mars. Helping humanity reach the red planet is one of Musk's long-stated aims and was what inspired him to start SpaceX. The company recently filed plans with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch 4,425 satellites into orbit above the Earth - three times as many that are currently in operation. 'Once fully deployed, the SpaceX system will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth's surface and therefore, in principle, have the ability to provide ubiquitous global service,' the firm said. 'Every point on the Earth's surface will see, at all times, a SpaceX satellite.' The network will provide internet access to the US and the rest of the world, it added. It is expected to take more than five years and $9.8 billion (Â£7.1bn) of investment, although satellite internet has proved an expensive market in the past and analysts expect the final bill will be higher. Musk compared the project to 'rebuilding the internet in space', as it would reduce reliance on the existing network of undersea fibre-optic cables which criss-cross the planet. In the US, the FCC welcomed the scheme as a way to provide internet connections to more people. "

Dog 'abducted from his Florida home' is found 1,400 miles away in Michigan two months later thanks to microchip ID matchÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8121363/Dog-abducted-Florida-home-1-400-miles-away-Michigan-two-months-later.html,"A dog from Florida, missing for more than two months, has been found 1,400 miles away in Michigan. Kris Gibson discovered Simba standing at her fence in Mount Morris Township, north of Flint. She lured him with a snack and took him to an animal clinic, which confirmed the dog's identity through his microchip. 'Usually when I find dogs, they never ever have a chip. I was pretty shocked,' Gibson told MLive.comabout the discovery she made on March 5. 'The staff at Mayfair contacted the owner who didnâ€™t understand her and hung up, Gibson explained in a Facebook post. 'The wonderful staff at Mayfair Animal Hospital went a step further and contacted the shelter that microchipped Simba as well as the microchip company.' Kassidy Gruno, a veterinary assistant at Mayfair Animal Hospital, believes the Miami dog, a Canary mastiff, might have been abducted with the intent of selling him. The owner of the pooch, whose breed is otherwise known as aPresa Canario in its native Canary Islands, Spain, said Simba was in the yard before he went missing. 'They are thousand-dollar dogs,' Gruno said. 'The cheapest one around here was $1,800.' Just 11 days ago Gibson shared that despite getting in contact with the owners via text, nobody knew 'how he got up here or how we are going to get him back home'. But as of last Thursday Gibson was making arrangements to return Simba to Florida. Non-profit organization Pilots N Paws arranged to fly the pet back home. Images shared on social media Sunday showed Gibson still bonding with Simba on a walk. 'For such a big guy he is a bit of a chicken,' she captions pictures. 'He didnâ€™t last long on this walk, he was way more interested in leaning on me for pets and scratches.' 'I always advocate for chipping,' Gibson added. 'I used to volunteer in rescue groups, and I would say 90 per cent of the dogs that come in arenâ€™t micro chipped, or they donâ€™t register them.' Mayfair Animal Hospital posted on Facebook:'The Mayfair team is so glad for Simba and his family. Microchipping your pets is fast, easy, and lasts for their entire lifetime!'"
93,How to make Big Macs at HOME: Foodie reveals her recipe for making 'identical' homemade versions of the iconic takeaway snackÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8115343/How-make-Big-Macs-HOME.html,"A woman has revealed her recipe to make homemade burgers that replicate a McDonald's Big Mac burger. Posting images of her delicious burgers to the Homemade McDonald's Facebook group, which currently has more than 26,700 members, the woman wrote: 'I think I may [have] wasted a lot of my life on making Big Macs'. As Australians love a classic Big Mac, the woman was praised for sharing the recipe online with some asking if she made the burger buns herself too â€“ which she sometimes does. To make the replica fast food burgers, the woman seasoned 500 grams of mince beef with salt and pepper and formed large but flat meat patties. 'Big Mac burgers are large and flat and shrink when fried so always go a bit bigger than the bun,' the woman said. 'I do it by eye but if you want to measure each one I think it's about 45 grams.' To make the sauce, she combined one cup of mayonnaise with garlic powder, onion powder, gherkin relish, white wine vinegar, yellow mustard, smoked paprika and and a pinch of salt. She then cooked the burger patties and assembled the burger. The Facebook post was well received online by impressed social media users. The woman also revealed has previously made a Vegetarian Deluxe burger and often makes the bread buns herself too. 'I made some [buns] but then stuck to shop bought,' she said. '[I can get] a basic brioche burger bun from most supermarkets'.

95,Cruise is back in control! Hollywood star shoots high-octane opening scenes for Mission: Impossible 7 after coronavirus forced production to relocate from Italy to the UK,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8121403/PICTURE-EXCLUSIVE-Tom-Cruise-shoots-high-octane-opening-scenes-Mission-Impossible-7.html,"Tom Cruise is fully back to work on production of Mission: Impossible 7 after the blockbuster was forced to halt production in Italy and relocate to the UK due to the global coronavirus pandemic. The Hollywood star, 57, was seen doing his own stunts in Dunsfold in Surrey, England, at a test track previously used for BBC motoring show Top Gear. The actor donned protective gear to perform stunts on a motorbike before getting behind the wheel of a car and speeding it around the tarmac, smoke billowing from it as he went. Cruise was seen performing a wheely on the bike, clad in a black bomber jacket and crash helmet. He seemed in high spirits as he straddled the bike and chatted to a member of the crew, as he waited to take to the tarmac for the dramatic sequence. For the car, he donned a beanie hat, and was seen in the driver's seat with another man, in blue. He stepped out in a black top, jeans and aviator shades as he made his way from vehicle to vehicle. Cruise - who has fronted all six, and now the seventh, Mission: Impossible films, has always performed his own stunts. It seems M:I 7 will feature the usual array of dare-devil sequences, with a multitude of vehicles on the track. As well as the motorcycle - which seemed to be involved in a chase scene - and the black car, there was a helicopter, a plane and a mini on set. The plane had the words Royal Air Force brandished across the side of it. Actress Rebecca Ferguson was seen inside the mini, with Cruise. In another sequence he was seen racing alongside it in a black car. The mini then screeched to a halt in front of a descending chopper. In February Cruise was forced to hole up in a luxury hotel in Venice after the filming of Mission: Impossible 7 was halted after the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy. The actor had been due to begin filming in some of the most picturesque and popular parts of the floating city but production was put into limbo after authorities enforced a total lockdown in order to stop further spread of the deadly disease. It was thought that Cruise and his co-stars would relocate to Buckinghamshire's Pinewood Studios following the disruption - where many major movies are shot. While the outdoor scenes were performed in Surrey on Tuesday, production seems to be continuing despite the pandemic, with Pinewood the likely option. When asked about the disruption, co-star Simon Pegg told BBC Radio 6: '[We're] not in Venice, that's where I'm supposed to be. Paramount were very cautious and sensible I think and pulled the production out of Venice. 'It's a big group of people, we were shooting carnival sequences and it was just unwise to remain so we bugged out. 'I think it would be indelicate to complain about anything other than the fact that there was a lot of disruption for everyone.' Mission: Impossible 7, which is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is set for a summer 2021 release, but the halt on filming could delay this. It's unsure whether the film will remain in production for much longer, with so many others having to put filming on ice until COVID-19 settles down. The likes of The Matrix 4, Fantastic Beasts 3 and Jurassic World: Dominion have all halted production for the time being. TV is also affected; shows such as Line Of Duty and Peaky Blinders are on an enforced break. Shows which involve a live studio audience are also being cancelled or filming without anyone in the audience. What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world. "

They are an interior designer's secret weapon and can be used to pull focus, alter dimensions or add a much needed splash of colour. What's more, there's a plethora of them available from patterned, geometric to different shapes and textures most of which are pretty affordable. So where to begin? Kitchens tend to be filled with strong horizontal and vertical lines created by cabinetry, islands and appliances, so geometric mosaics are a fantastic way of introducing visual contrasts,' said Fired Earth's creative director Colin Roby-Welford. 'Tiles in striking shapes such as chevrons, triangles and hexagons will subvert horizontal and vertical lines, while the sweeping curves of Arabesque or fanshaped designs will soften a scheme and prevent it from looking too linear.' Try Fired Earth's Nebula Green Hexagon Â£9.60, which will give some oomph to a tired kitchen or bathroom (firedearth.com). One of the most popular and enduring styles are Andalusian and Moroccan tiles. 'Moroccan tiles are famed for their intricate patterns and decorative style which bring drama to any decor,' said Harriet Goodacre, Topps Tiles style consultant. A few Topps Tiles Archivo Bakula Tiles arranged as a splashback (Â£1.11 a tile or Â£71.04/m2) is a reasonable way to make a change. Lee Thornley, founder of Bert & May, was so entranced by the art of reusing tiles that he moved from London to Andalusia and set up a reclaimed tile company. Bert & May tiles have an attractive chalky finish and come in array of soft colours this 'washed out' look is very of the moment and easy to blend with the other aspects of your interior (bertandmay.com). Stars are a bestseller for them (Luna Saphire Â£3.50 per tile) and they report a trend towards busier patterns and intricate detail.' Check out the Fluer Tile Â£3.88 or the geometric Soho House Redchurch tile, Â£6. Those with a bigger budget might want to investigate the Antique replica collection, which starts from Â£30 a tile. The vogue now is to experiment with using tiles in more unusual places, such as kitchen islands units, staircases and headboards for maximum impact. Americans Caitlin and Samuel Dowe-Sandes set up Popham Studio in Marrakech. 'I think we are in a golden age of utility meeting decorative potential,' said Caitlin. Alongside traditional places, she suggests using them 'for feature walks, alternative headboards and chimney surrounds' (Popham tiles from Â£225 per sq m at daytrue.com). Those not ready to embrace patterned tiles could experiment with layout. 'The most popular style we are finding currently is the ordinary brick effect tile but used in multiple different ways such as ""brick style"", chevron or staggered herringbone,' said Louise Ashdown, head of design at West One Bathrooms. While using floor tiles is nothing new, 'people are beginning to realise that floor space is a bit of a blank canvas - almost a fifth wall,' said Fired Earth's Roby-Welford. (Encaustic tiles Â£8.99,firedearth.com, each make for a bold floor statement.) There are, however, a few rules to consider when playing with tiles, according to London based interior designer Lizzie Green, 'laying parquet tiles the length of a room can make it seem longer and laying tiles vertically can make the ceiling feel higher. 'I recently laid a border of tiles around the top of a high ceilinged bathroom to draw the eyes up. 'In small spaces I wouldn't use huge tiles and the same goes for large rooms, I would only lay large tiles to eliminate the lines of grout.'"

Honey Boo Boo's sisters Anna Cardwell and Jessica Shannon underwent major plastic surgery procedures costing upward of $120,000. Anna, 25, and Jessica, 23, had the surgeries during a visit to Los Angeles last month, and showed DailyMailTV their new smiles, breast lifts and implants, along with graphic photos of their bodies during the surgeries that show just how serious the procedures are. Jessica said her weight and dreams of becoming a plus-sized model were huge motivators in her decision to follow through with plastic surgery. 'I've always struggled with like my weight, so I've tried to find different ways to help me out but like nothing's ever helped,' Jessica told DailyMailTV. Both sisters agreed that the makeovers would boost their self-esteem and confidence. 'I don't have confidence in myself,' Anna said. 'Hopefully this will, you know, get it up there.' 'It'll give me like a healthier lifestyle,' she added. The sisters did admit they were nervous about the procedures when DailyMailTV sat down with the women ahead of their surgeries. 'I'm just not ready to go through this pain,' Anna said at the time. 'I'm just a tad bit nervous.' Jessica said she was also 'nervous and scared.' But the reality stars got over their jitters last month to start their makeover journey. ANNA Anna racked up $47,450 in procedures including a breast lift and implants from Dr. Obeng. The mother-of-two went from a B cup to a D cup while under the knife for a new figure, and also received 16 veneers from Dr. Aamir Wahab. 'I am getting a boob lift!' Anna told DailyMailTV before the surgery. Dr. Obeng gave Anna 500 'CC' allergen breast implants. 'It's going to make my boyfriend very happy,' Anna said. Once she and her sister recovered from surgery, they got their hair colored, cut and styled by Sandra Diclemente for their total makeover. Anna went for an icey blonde look. Anna said after the procedure she could not stop smiling. 'I can't stop smiling with my teeth being done,' she said. 'I have a fuller figure and I can't stop wearing like kind of like little tight shirts, kind of show 'em off just a little bit.' 'It's just an amazing feeling like there's no words for it,' she added. JESSICA Jessica had surgery to insert an orbera balloon in her stomach to promote weight loss and underwent a 350 liposuction procedure. Her bill tallied up to $80,895 from the 'weight loss balloon' procedure performed by Dr. Sam Kashani. She also received liposuction 'on her back, flanks and bra area,' in addition to a tummy tuck from Dr. Michael K. Obeng. Jessica began her quest for a new figure starting at 230lbs. She is now down to 185lbs and hopes to become 'a plus-sized model' in addition to finding a relationship. She also updated her smile with eight veneers from Dr. Aamir Wahab, who also operated on her sister. To top off her now-perfect smile, Jessica had laser teeth whitening. Jessica said after the transformation: 'It makes me feel real good.' 'The first week I just noticed my face was getting smaller and now I feel like every day when I wake up my waist is smaller.' 'Your confidence level goes up like extremely,' Jessica added. 'There's no looking back. I love what we did and I wouldn't trade it for the world.' Doctors say Jessica and Anna won't see the full effects of their surgeries until they've completely healed. "

Ruth-Anne Cunningham, 34, who is best known for penning American vocalist JoJo's 2006 hit, Too Little Too Late, partnered with make-up artist Jemma Louise from London for a candid Instagram post. The singer shared a photograph of her body painted with symptoms of endometriosis including bloating and infertility, in the hopes of raising awareness among her 34,000 followers.  Many were impressed by the post and confessed they've struggled to speak about their experiences of living with the condition. Ruth-Anne posted a lengthy explanation of the symptoms many who have endometriosis suffer in addition to a personal account of her experience. She wrote: Just because you canâ€™t see it doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t exist. This is a very vulnerable post but I want to help visualise the pain that we, the 1 in 10 women with endometriosis suffer daily with, or throughout the month living with this chronic disease. 'This isnâ€™t for sympathy, it is to educate and create awareness. Itâ€™s very hard to understand a disease that is internal, that you canâ€™t see. 'And throughout my endo journey at times I did not feel believed, or I was made to feel dramatic, or that it couldnâ€™t be as bad as I was saying, because I looked fine on the outside. But it really is this bad. 'So me and my friend who is an amazing body paint artist and a fellow endo warrior Jemma Louise did this to help everyone really get a better visual understanding of the reality of [living with] this. 'There are 200 million women worldwide living with daily excruciating pains and exhaustion that feels like barb wired is wrapped tightly around you, ripping your insides apart - while a hot iron is burning the insides of your stomach while being punched in the ovaries/womb - while a sharp knife is cutting into your lower back, the bloating, the scars, the fatigue, the years of pain before diagnosis, the recovery from multiple surgeries, the threat to your future children or the absolute heartbreak of infertility. According to the NHS, Endometriosis is a condition 'where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes.' The condition can be difficult to diagnosis as symptoms often vary.They can include pain in the lower stomach or back, difficulty getting pregnant in addition to period pain that can impact carrying out normal activities. It is advised to make a note if you experience the symptoms in preparation for seeing your GP for further examination and treatment. 'And the toll it takes on your mental health is a whole other post. So I applaud every woman living, surviving and thriving with this disease. I hope doctors find us a cause, a cure. 'I hope schools will start educating menstrual health. I hope this visual helps [to] bring everyone more understanding. And if you are feeling like this during your period or anytime please go see your doctor now.' A flood of responses to the post came from those praising Ruth-Anne for highlighting the disease, as they agreed the artwork is an accurate representation of how it feels to live with endometriosis. 'A beautiful, insightful and thought-provoking depiction. Well done for sharing @ThisIsRuthAnne,' wrote one. Many shared their own experiences of suffering with endometriosis, revealing they had to overcome a series of challenges in order to be diagnosed. One person wrote: 'It's taken 13 years for me to be diagnosed and I spent my teenage years in agony and being fobbed off as a dramatic teenager. I was even told by one doctors to go and have a baby with my then boyfriend as that would help the pain for awhile. The system is horrifically behind and it needs to change!! Couldn't relate to this post more, fair play for highlighting' Another said: 'I too was diagnosed with endometriosis in my 20s and endured several surgeries. As you say the pain is indescribable. At 30 I was told due to losing an ovary and scarring that I would never have children. 'At 36 I was told that I was in early menopause, which was deeply distressing. However just before I was 39 I conceived naturally and gave birth to my wonderful son Lukeyfriend. So please don't give up hope and if you wish to talk Luke has my number. I send love and hope to you and all women who have this debilitating disease and hope that a cure can be found soon. Much love' A third added: 'As a teen with endometriosis, I received the diagnosis when I was 15. Now I'm almost 17 and have tried everything from pills to painkillers - since there isn't much that my OBGYN can do for me at this age. Still suffering with the pain, bloating, fatigue, headache and things of the sort'"
0,Trump administration is slammed by state officials amid chaotic airport scenes as thousands of returning Americans face HOURS waiting for virus screening and risk becoming carriersÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114453/Trump-pleads-calm-THOUSANDS-Americans-herded-lines-hours-airports.html,"Harsh criticism rained on the Trump administration Sunday from state and local officials over long lines of returning international passengers at some U.S. airports that could have turned them into coronavirus carriers as they tried to get home. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, both Democrats, lambasted the administration for allowing about 3,000 Americans returning from Europe to be stuck for hours inside the customs area at O'Hare International Airport on Saturday, violating federal recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that people practice 'social distance.' The passengers, many of them rushing home because of fears they would be stuck in Europe, were screened by federal customs and homeland security agents for coronavirus symptoms before they were allowed to leave the airport. Long lines also formed Saturday in Boston, Dallas and others of the 13 airports that are accepting return flights from Europe. Conditions were better Sunday, but lines could again grow as the day progresses and more flights arrive. 'People were forced into conditions that are against CDC guidance and are totally unacceptable,' Lightfoot said. Lightfoot singled out Vice President Mike Pence and his coronavirus task force for not talking with local officials before implementing the screening program. State and local officials could have offered 'concrete suggestions' for how the program could have been implemented with the least disruption, she said, but the administration acted unilaterally. 'Thousands of travelers were forced to wait in exceedingly long lines, congregating in concourses and putting themselves and their loved ones at greater risk of exposure,' Lightfoot said. Passengers Sunday will likely be kept on their planes to manage the flow into the customs area, she said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, a Republican and strong supporter of the president, tweeted Sunday that the lines in Dallas are 'unacceptable & I'm working hard to get it fixed.' He said he had contacted the head of Homeland Security, acting Secretary Chad Wolf. Not every U.S. airport accepting European arrivals experienced overcrowding. Airports serving Miami, Seattle, Los Angeles and Newark, New Jersey, reported short lines at customs Saturday and Sunday. Pritzker said Sunday on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that the administration should have bolstered staffing at the receiving airports in anticipation of long lines. But instead, he said, passengers 'were stuck in a small area, hundreds and hundreds of people, and that's exactly what you don't want in this pandemic.' He predicted Sunday would 'be even worse.' President Donald Trump defended the administration's actions in a tweet Sunday. 'We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!' he wrote. Acting Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan said in a written statement Sunday that the agency is making improvements to its procedures, but that it must 'balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens through enhanced medical screening.' Katy Rogers spent four hours Saturday at O'Hare in a tightly packed space with students, a basketball team, musicians and older people in wheelchairs. 'Everybody was nervous about it,' she said Sunday. 'Everyone working there was confused and frustrated, and there were hands were tied, too.' Even though she showed no signs of being sick, she now plans to quarantine herself on the organic produce farm she runs in Noblesville, Indiana. Elizabeth Pulvermacher, a University of Wisconsin student, arrived Saturday at O'Hare from Madrid, where she had been studying. The customs process made her feel 'unsafe,' she said. 'The whole idea is getting rid of the spread of coronavirus, but there were hundreds and hundreds of people in very close proximity,' Pulvermacher said. Overcrowding at airports began Saturday night as top U.S. immunologist expert Anthony Fauci told people to avoid public areas where there are a lot of people around. 'We'd like to not see crowds like that,' Fauci told Fox News's Chris Wallace Sunday morning when discussing the scenes from the airports. 'I think people understand if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member, that you can get back, you don't need to rush back,' he said. 'But it's understandable if when people see a travel ban, they immediately want to ... get home.' Trump previewed Sunday that the coronavirus task force would be holding a press conference at the White House later in the evening. 'There will be a News Conference by the CoronaVirus Task Force today at the White House, 5 P.M.,' he tweeted, tagging Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the task force. 'We are working closely with the Governors of our Country's great States, which are a very big factor,' he continued. 'They are working hard, along with us, to get the job properly done.' 'The USA was never set up for this,' he asserted of the coronavirus outbreak, 'just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!' The scenes at the 13 airports were similar across the country - from Boston to Chicago, Atlanta to Dallas. Lines were particularly bad at JFK Terminal 4, Chicago O'Hare Terminal 5 and Dallas/Fort Worth airport with passengers packed in tight, many of them wearing face masks. Customs and Border Protection Officers were completely overwhelmed as U.S. citizens rushed to get back into the country as President Trump's European travel ban went into effect following his Oval Office address Wednesday evening. Some passengers reported that just six out of a possible 60 booths were staffed with agents at JFK Terminal 4. At Chicago O'Hare airport, lines could be seen snaking along corridors and up escalators as passengers were given additional health screenings. It was a similar picture at Dallas/Fort Worth airport with passengers waiting for hours and many resigned to sitting on the floor while passengers were processed. Many were concerned about being so close to others during the coronavirus outbreak. DFW airport said: 'CBP officers and the CDC are following federal guidelines to conduct enhanced screening for passengers.' Under the restrictions, American citizens and green card holders are able to return home to the U.S., but only through one of the 13 designated airports under the understanding that they may also be subjected to health screenings and quarantine orders. On Saturday, President Trump announced the United States was to broaden its European travel ban and adding the United Kingdom and Ireland to its list.He originally announced the European travel suspension in his Oval Office address Wednesday. 'President Donald J. Trump Vice President Mike Pence since this is the only communication medium you pay attention to â€“ you need to do something NOW,' Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker scolded the Trump administration on Twitter after witnessing the lines at O'Hare. 'To the frustrated people trying to get home, I have spoken with the mayor and our Senators and we are working together to get the federal government to act to solve this. We will do everything within our power to get relief. The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW. Upon arriving in the country, passengers are subjected to 'enhanced screening' where they won't have their temperatures taken or be tested for COVID-19, but are asked a series of questions about their medical conditions and travel history. Then, they'll be advised to self-quarantine and follow CDC guidelines. 'Upon arrival, travelers will proceed to standard customs processing. They will then continue to enhanced entry screening where the passenger will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and asked for contact information for local health authorities. 'Passengers will then be given written guidance about COVID-19 and directed to proceed to their final destination, and immediately home-quarantine in accordance with CDC best practices,' the announcement read. Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf described the measures as 'aggressive'. He added: 'To minimize disruptions to travelers, TSA, CBP, and air carriers are working to identify qualifying passengers before their scheduled flights. 'These passengers will be rerouted to one of the 13 airports by their airline at no cost to them,' he said. The measures are far less severe than had been suggested by Trump in his address, or promised by him on Thursday. Trump insisted that Americans would be tested for the virus before they got on planes in Europe and that if any of them tested positive for the virus, they would not be allowed to board. He did not provide any context for such plans including who would provide the tests, where he would find them and what would happen to passengers who subsequently tested positive. Thousands of Americans scrambled to get home on Friday, often paying thousands of dollars for their fare before the borders close. US airlines like Delta have also begun pulling their flight schedules to Europe, raising the question that transatlantic travel may soon be entirely halted for the entirety of Trump's 30 day ban. There remains an abundance of questions over how long the virus will last, how it will impact America and how Americans will be able to rid themselves of it. There is currently no cure and no vaccine, and only the severely sick or people showing severe symptoms are being given tests due to a shortage and lack of lab staff. Trump declared a national state of emergency as the World Health Organization named Europe the new epicenter of the coronavirus Friday, with countries sealing borders, shutting schools and canceling events in a frenzied attempt to slow the ballooning pandemic. Americans traveling in Europe scrambled to buy last-minute plane tickets, in some cases spending thousands of dollars each, in hopes of speedily returning to the country before President Trump's travel ban comes into effect. One family of three paid nearly $8,000 for three one-way tickets from Paris to New York. 'I feel like they were putting a price tag on people's safety,' Coral McNary told ABC News on Friday. 'That's scary, especially if people can't afford it.' Jake Genachowski, an American who was traveling in Switzerland, made it back home just in time before the ban kicked in. He said that when he arrived, there was no screening for coronavirus. 'Just made it through customs, Genachowski told ABC News shortly after arriving back in the states. He said arriving passengers were asked if they had flu-like symptoms, but they were not asked if they had been to Italy or any other country hard-hit by the coronavirus."
1,"Dr. Fauci tells Trump he wants a 14-day national shutdown as part of an 'overly aggressive' response to the coronavirus that would see millions hunker down - as death toll hits 60 and cases surge past 3,000Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114025/Fauci-doesnt-rule-worst-case-scenario-potential-1-7-million-U-S-deaths-coronavirus.html,"The governmentâ€™s top infectious disease expert said Sunday he would like to see aggressive measures such as a 14-day national shutdown that would require Americans to hunker down even more to help slow spread of the coronavirus. Earlier on Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the U.S. should be prepared to do 'whatever it takes' to tackle the pandemic, though he stopped short of recommending a two-week national shutdown. He later said he raised the issue of measures such as a shutdown with the Trump administration, and said it has been open to his ideas. Dr. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said he would rather America be 'overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting' than be unprepared for the crisis, adding that citizens should be prepared to 'hunker down'. The key member of the Trump administration's coronavirus task force also warned that young people are 'not immune' and that many could 'wind up getting seriously ill' as he urged a dramatic drop in people visiting bars and restaurants. When asked if he would like a two week national shutdown to stop the spread of coronavirus, during aninterview with NBC News' Meet the Press Sunday morning, Dr Fauci said he wanted the government to take as much action 'as we possibly could.' He continuedthat Americans need to prepare to take extra precautions than they are used to taking, like staying home instead of going to bars and restaurants and steering clear of the elderly community. 'Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,' he told NBC's Chuck Todd. 'Everybody has got to get involved in distancing themselves socially,' he added. 'I think we should be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.' 'We gotta make sure that the vulnerable ones are the ones we protect â€” the elderly and those with underlying conditions.' Asked the same question on a shut down by CNN's Brianna Keilar on State of the Union, he added he'd 'like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction we see in restaurants and in bars.' 'Whatever it takes to do that, that's what I'd like to see,' Fauci added, otherwise there are 'going to be people who are young who are going to wind up getting seriously ill' 'We need to be very serious about - for a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States,' he said. 'We have to just accept that if we want to do what's best for the American public.' The diseases expert admitted that Americans haven't seen the worst ofcoronavirus yet, claiming it's 'possible' that the death toll could near 2 million in the U.S. if all efforts to mitigate the outbreak fail. 'Although that's possible, it is unlikely if we do the kinds of things that we're essentially outlining right now,' the top immunologist and expert on infectious diseases at the National Institute of Health outlined Sunday morning. Fauci was responding to an analysis released by The New York Times detailing the 'worst case scenario' estimation of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and death tolls that could result from the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. The Times' report, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scenarios, insists there could be between 200,000 and 1.7 million deaths in the U.S. from coronavirus. But Fauci told ABC News' This Week in an interview Sunday, that the cases in the Times model would only happen if the U.S. did nothing to respond to the virus, or if mitigations and containments don't succeed at all. 'I don't think it's going to be that worse,' he told ABC's Jonathan Karl. So far there are almost 3,000 cases of coronavirus in the U.S. â€“ a number that has skyrocketed in the last few days â€“ and the death toll in the nation is nearing 60. Fauci added that it would take months for Americans to get their lives 'back to normal.' 'It's going to be a matter of several weeks to a few months, for sure,' Fauci said. Although Fauci, 79, said the federal government is 'absolutely' doing everything that needs to be done to address the crisis, he added 'there's no country or anybody in the world that's going to be perfectly prepared.' Fauci said one reason the worst case scenario could be avoided in the U.S. is because Trump closed down travel from certain countries early on, like China â€“ where the virus originated. More recently, the president also shut down travel from Europe, where coronavirus has become much more widespread after a massive outbreak in Italy. There has been chatter that Trump's next move could be shutting down or imposing domestic travel restrictions after declaring a national emergency during a press conference on Friday. 'I don't see that right now in the immediate future but remember,' Fauci said, adding: 'We are very open-minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public.' Trump was tested for coronavirus, he revealed Saturday, and on Sunday the White House released a statement claiming he tested negative, despite coming into contact with a Brazilian press aide who has the disease."
2,UN diplomats claim NYC officials told them 'coronavirus has spread throughout the city and EVERYONE should assume they have been exposed - with the threat lasting until fall'Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113891/Mayor-Blasios-office-says-NYC-assume-theyve-exposed-coronavirus.html,"Several United Nations diplomats claim New York City officials warned them thateveryone in the city should assume they've been exposed to the novel coronavirusand threats of proliferating cases are projected to last until the fall. On Saturday New York City commissioner Penny Abeywardena in the Mayor's Office for International Affairs and officials with theNYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene led a briefing for foreign delegations in the city. 'Everyone in New York should assume that they have been in contact with COVID 19,' a read-out of the conference call obtained by Foreign Policy from a representative of a diplomatic mission who listened in said. In the Saturday briefing officials stressed that the city is 'in the mitigation phase of the outbreak' and the virus could threaten the health of residents until as late as September, four diplomat sources said. DailyMail.com has reached out to the Mayor's Office for International Affairs for comment. 'This means that all individuals should assume that they have had some contact with the virus and practice maximum-possible social distancing; most cases will be mild and medical care should only be sought in urgent, worsening, or vulnerable cases,' the read-out said Saturday. Some health experts have projected that the novel coronavirus will rapidly spread then ebb for the warmer spring and summer seasons just like the common cold and flu, however some researchers point out that the virus is still spreading in warmer parts of the globe despite higher temperatures. On Saturday the number of confirmed cases in New York state hit 729 with 329 cases reported in New York City. The city saw two tragic deaths on Saturday - a 65-year-old man from Rockland County and an 82-year-old woman from Brooklyn. In the Saturday briefing officials said the city is not offering special services to foreign diplomats exposed to the virus in New York. Instead diplomats and dignitaries were given the same warnings to stay at home and practice social distancing. 'There are no particular measures. If you're sick, stay home - this is how we save New York,' a read-out from the briefing said. While diplomats said they welcomed the city's honestly, some said the lack of measures was startling. With no special procedures in place, delegations are responsible for disinfecting their own mission's in the event of an outbreak because the city lacks supplies for them. 'Itâ€™s your responsibility not to get infected, and your responsibility to stay home if you do. Your odds of not dying are rather great â€” if you get close ""give us a call,""' one senior diplomat said on the New York's standoff policy. When asked if the city will have widely available testing and if a list of testing centers would be made available to foreign missions the briefers said 'No.' 'You will be tested if a doctor advises; calling 311 can give access to a provider if a patient doesnâ€™t have one.Testing should be reserved for the sickest (hospitalized) patients,' briefers said. In the call briefers said the city is less focused on testing and is now honing on on minimizing exposure. 'Testing is now less important â€” the danger of transmission is much higher as many people have now been exposed and the majority of people will only have mild symptom,' they said. The people most at risk of being hard hit by the killer coronavirus are the vulnerable including those over 70 years of age and individuals who are over the age of 50 with underlying health conditions. In a startling move the briefers said that New York will not focus on contact tracing - the process of identifying people who may have come into contact with an infected person - a strategy encouraged by the World Health Organization to combat the spreading virus. 'Interviews with confirmed cases and contact tracing is not a good use of our resources when the virus is widespread. There will be little emphasis on tracing,' briefers said at Saturday's meeting. Contact tracing is a strategy that has helped South Korea get their coronavirus outbreak under control. The symptoms associated with the disease include fever, dry coughs, and difficulty breathing. Health officials said that people infected with the coronavirus remain infectious for about 72 hours after their initial fever subsides - and they should remain in isolation for an additional seven days after those symptoms wane. 'We are hopeful that exposure to COVID will make people immune, but too early to say definitely,' the briefers added. Now de Blasio's office is scrambling to slow the fast-spreading crisis. While he has resisted adamant calls for him to close down public schools, he announced his administration is moving forward with plans to 'offer telecommuting or a staffer work schedule for about 100,000 city employees'. On Friday President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency as the national toll case hit over 2,900."
3,America first: Trump 'is trying to poach German researchers working on a coronavirus vaccine and is offering them money to make it EXCLUSIVE to the US',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114015/Donald-Trump-tries-pay-German-company-creating-experimental-coronavirus-vaccine-US.html,"German officials are trying to stop the Trump administration from luring German biopharmeceutical company CureVac to the US to get its experimental coronavirus vaccines exclusively for Americans. President Donald Trump has offered funds to lure the company CureVac to the US. The German government has made counter-offers to make the company stay, according to a report in Germannewspaper Welt am Sonntag. An unidentified German government source told the paper Trump is trying to secure the scientists' work exclusively, and would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States - 'but only for the United States.' CureVac said last week they are working onwith a multitude of coronavirus vaccine candidates and are selecting the two best to go into clinical trials. The company's CEO met with President Donald Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to discuss a vaccine earlier this month. German politicians are now insisting that no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine. DailyMail.com has reached out to the White House for comment. 'The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,' the newspaper quoted a Health Ministry official as saying. 'In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac.' A spokeswoman for the German Health Ministry said: 'We confirm the report in the Welt am Sonntag.' The US Embassy in Berlin and CureVac is yet to comment on the report. 'The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means. Capitalism has limits,'Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology who is also a senior lawmaker with the Social Democrats, tweeted in reaction to the report. Curevac is a private company founded in 2008 based in Tuebingen with other sites in Frankfurt and Boston. CureVac said the company is getting ready to take experimental coronavirus vaccines to clinical trials,Florian von der Muelbe, CureVac's chief production officer and co-founder, said last week. The company hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans. The company said that a mode of action that allowed for a low dosage to trigger an immune reaction against rabies would be applied in the coronavirus setting. 'These minimal dosages that we have achieved put us in a position here in Tuebingen to produce up to 10 million doses per (production) campaign,' von der Muelbe said of a potential vaccine. A campaign, or production cycle, lasts several weeks. 'More than one dose may be required to immunize a person, but one campaign would still serve several million people,' he said. Then-CureVac CEO Daniel Menichella met Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and senior representatives of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discuss a vaccine at the White House on March 2. 'We believe we can develop the vaccine for COVID-19 very, very quickly, and we have the wherewithal to manufacture it, although we would like some additional help on our largest GMP fourth facility,' Menichella said at that meeting. In that White House meeting the top executives from nearly a dozen biotech and pharmaceutical companies briefed Trump on their coronavirus drug development plans. Menichella, who became CEO in May 2018, was abruptly replaced by board chairman Ingmar Hoerr just nine days after his DC meeting with Trump and drugmakers. 'We will continue to focus fully on taking the company to the next stage of its development and advance our clinical product pipeline with the goal of bringing mRNA-based drugs to patients. The vaccine against Covid-19 plays a key role here,' Hoerr said according to BioPharma Dive after Menichella was ousted. CureVac specializes in RNA molecules that instruct human cells to produce therapeutic proteins that trigger an immune response to cancer or infection diseases. CureVac was granted $8.3million by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in January to build a solution based on its low-dose vaccine technology. Dievini Hopp BioTech Holding and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are two prominent investors in CureVac. Top US health officials have said that it would take up to 18 months to develop any vaccine against the pathogen."
4,"Kentucky man, 53, who tested positive for coronavirus and refused to self-isolate is placed under mandatory quarantine by guard posted outside his home 24 hours a day",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114719/Kentucky-man-coronavirus-placed-mandatory-quarantine-refusing-self-isolate.html,"Kentucky has taken the extraordinary step of forcing a resident diagnosed with coronavirus to self-quarantine after refusing to do so. Governor Andy Beshear said on Saturday that authorities in the state found four more confirmed cases of the pathogen, including one patient in Nelson County who was forced into his home. According to Beshear, a 53-year-old man tested positive for coronavirus at the University of Louisville. When authorities insisted that the man self-quarantine, he refused, according to the Lexington Herald Dealer. Dean Watts, the Nelson County judge-executive, declared a state of emergency, which triggered a rarely used law that allows him to force a resident into â€˜self-isolation or quarantine.â€™ A law enforcement officer has now been stationed outside of the manâ€™s home for 24 hours. â€˜Itâ€™s a step I hoped Iâ€™d never have to take, but we canâ€™t allow one person who we know has the virus to refuse to protect their neighbors,â€™ Beshear said. â€˜Weâ€™ve got to make sure that people who have tested positive, that we know could be spreading the virus, and simply refuse to do the right thing, do the right thing.â€™ As of Sunday, there are 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Kentucky. Beshear has instructed all hospitals in the state to suspend elective surgeries and procedures by the close of business on Wednesday. All child care centers have been told to plan for closure on short notice. â€˜We just have to do what it takes to lessen the spread of this coronavirus and I donâ€™t want to be the governor that waits two weeks too late to take some of those steps,â€™ Beshear told reporters on Saturday. The 18 confirmed cases include six in Harrison County, five in Fayette County, four in Jefferson County, one in Bourbon County, one in Montgomery County, and one in Nelson County. The patient in Montgomery County attended Mass at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Mount Sterling last week. Authorities have warned those who were in attendance to self-monitor for symptoms of coronavirus. The patient is at home in self-isolation. The Bourbon County patient is being treated at hospital. Meanwhile, the federal governmentâ€™s top infectious disease expert said Sunday he would like to see aggressive measures such as a 14-day national shutdown that would require Americans to hunker down even more to help slow spread of the coronavirus. Still, Dr. Anthony Fauci said travel restrictions within the United States, such as to and from hard-hit Washington state and California, probably will not be needed anytime soon. Fauci, the public face of the administrationâ€™s messaging during a round of morning TV interviews, said the country should do as much as 'we possibly could,' even if officials are criticized for 'overreacting.' He said he raised the issue of measures such as a shutdown with the Trump administration, and said it has been open to his ideas. 'I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,' said Fauci, a member of the White House task force on combating the spread of coronavirus. He heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci said the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions should already be hunkering down, but other Americans, too, should consider 'much more' restrictions on outside activity, from work and travel to possibly eating at restaurants. 'Everybody has got to get involved in distancing themselves socially,' Fauci said. 'Everything is on the table,' he said. 'Right now, myself personally, I wouldn't go to a restaurant. I just wouldnâ€™t because I donâ€™t want to be in a crowded place.... 'I donâ€™t want to be in a situation where Iâ€™m going to be all of a sudden self-isolating for 14 days.' The virus has an incubation period of anywhere from two days to 14 days before symptoms emerge. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 156,000 people and left more than 5,800 dead. The death toll in the United States has reached more than 50, while infections neared 3,000 across 49 states and the District of Columbia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover. President Donald Trump last week announced a sweeping travel ban for much of Europe. On Saturday, he added the United Kingdom and Ireland to a list of countries that would face travel restrictions over the next 30 days. The State Department on Sunday said it would allow US personnel to leave their diplomatic or consular posts worldwide if they or family members were medically determined to be at a higher risk of falling very ill if exposed to the virus. Trump also has pledged broadened US testing for the virus as major employers such as Apple Inc. have sent workers home to telework and several states and big cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, shuttered down schools for a week or more. In the nationâ€™s capital, White House officials said Trump tested negative for the virus over the weekend after he was recently in contact with three people at his Florida resort who tested positive, and several lawmakers in recent days have said they were self-quarantining out of an abundance of caution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat from California, said Congress has started work on a new aid package after the one just approved by the House early Saturday. The new one would provide direct relief to Americans suffering physically, financially and emotionally from the coronavirus pandemic. 'We have already begun work to develop a third emergency response package,' Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues. With the US Capitol among the many iconic landmarks closed to tours, Pelosi also urged lawmakers to have most of their Washington staff telework from home, as health officials urge social distancing. House lawmakers are away on weeklong recess and many have already curtailed office visits at their local offices, as well. Democratic Rep Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on Sunday said a former staff member tested positive for the virus. The staffer, Daniel Goldman, the attorney who led Democratic questioning during the House impeachment hearings, had left the office 10 days ago and he's believed to have contracted the virus after his departure. 'We will still be taking additional precautions over the next few days,' Schiff said. 'The former staffer is feeling better and no current staff have reported any flu-like symptoms at this time.' NIH reported Sunday that one of its staff working in its division on arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases had tested positive for COVID-19, its first case. NIH said the person was not involved in patient care and was now quarantined at home and 'doing well.' Trump has suggested that restrictions on travel within the U.S. to areas hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic could be next. But Fauci on Sunday played down that or having major national lockdowns on the level now seen in European countries such as Italy and Spain. 'We feel that with rather stringent mitigation and containment, without necessarily complete lockdown, we would be able to prevent ourselves from getting to where, unfortunately, Italy is now,' Fauci said. 'With regard to domestic travel bans, we always talk about it, consider everything. 'But I can tell you that has not been seriously considered, doing travel bans in the country. ... I donâ€™t see that right now or in the immediate future.' At the White House, Trump on Sunday held a call with more than two dozen grocery store and supply chain executives to discuss their response to coronavirus outbreak. Retailers have reported seeing a crush of shoppers flocking to stores to stock up on food and other essentials. Consumers have expressed frustration that some items - such as hand sanitizer and toilet paper - are becoming more difficult to find. During the call, Trump expressed appreciation for their work to ensure food stocks are 'constantly available' so 'Americans feel calm and safe when shelves are stocked with the items they need,' according to White House spokesman Judd Deere. 'Supply chains in the United States are strong, and it is unnecessary for the American public to hoard daily essentials,' Deere said. Still, more than the crisis was on Trumpâ€™s mind. He tweeted that he was considering a full pardon for Michael Flynn, his disgraced former national security adviser, and he directed barbs at a familiar target, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow expressed confidence that supply lines such as food for stores will be largely unaffected by the virus outbreak. 'Most of America is still working,' he said. 'Factories are not shutting down across the country, at least not yet.' Trump, who declared Sunday a National Day of Prayer, said he tuned in to the live stream from the Free Chapel, a Gainesville, Georgia evangelical church led by Jentezen Franklin. 'I am watching a great and beautiful service by Pastor Jentezen Franklin. Thank you!' Trump tweeted. Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the White House task force, said he planned to disclose more details about a web site being developed by Verily, a subsidiary of Googleâ€™s parent company, that is being designed to help communities assess and direct Americans to sites conducting coronavirus screening. Trump on Friday announced the imminent rollout of a website 'facilitated' by Google that would guide users through a series of questions to determine whether they should be screened for the virus. The company, however, has said that the web site was in early stages of development and would be focused on the San Francisco Bay Area. Fauci spoke on NBCâ€™s Meet the Press, CNNâ€™s State of the Union, ABCâ€™s This Week, Fox News Sunday, and CBSâ€™ Face the Nation. Kudlow appeared on CBS."
5,"Mayor Bill de Blasio is considering a NYC LOCKDOWN and expects coronavirus cases to exceed 1,000 in the next few days as NY state reports its third virus deathÂ Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114321/Bill-Blasio-considers-locking-NYC-claims-far-coronavirus-response.html,"Bill de Blasio said Sunday that he isn't ruling out quarantining New York City as cases of coronavirus in the most populous U.S. city skyrocketed this week. 'Every option is on the table in a crisis,' de Blasio told CNN Sunday morning. 'We've never seen anything like this,' the Democratic New York City mayor, who had a quick stint running in the presidential primary, continued. 'It's changing every hour so we're going to constantly make new decisions,' de Blasio said, adding he expected the case tally in the city to rise to 1,000 in the next few days. De Blasio claimed New York City is far worse off and 'so far behind' because of federal government failures and delays. Donald Trump declared a national state of emergency on Friday during a press conference in the Rose Garden, but de Blasio says he needs to go even further. 'We need the federal government to take over the supply change right now,' he said. 'Right now we have to make sure the places in this country that need more ventilators, surgical masks, they need hand sanitizers, that that is a federalized dynamic where those factories that produce those goods are put on 24/7 shifts.' 'Right behind that is the question of food and basic supplies. If the federal government doesn't realize this is the equivalent of war already there is no way the states and localities can make all the adjustments we need to,' de Blasio continued. New York City officials warned the UN diplomatic community that everyone in the city should assume they've been in contact with the novel coronavirus, according to one for you. They said threats of proliferating cases are projected to last until the fall. On Saturday New York City commissioner Penny Abeywardena in the Mayor's Office for International Affairs and officials with theNYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene held a briefing for foreign delegations in the city.

6,Republican Devin Nunes slams China for downplaying the coronavirus when it began and points to the whistleblower doctor who died of the disease as evidence of a cover upÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114703/Republican-Devin-Nunes-slams-China-inefficient.html,"Republican Devin Nunes on Sunday slammed China's response to the coronavirus pandemic as 'inefficient', arguing the 'communist dictatorship downplayed' the outbreak in an escalating war of words between the two nations. Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, pointed to the whistleblower doctor who died of the disease as evidence of the cover up in an interview with Fox News Sunday. He told Sunday Morning Futures: 'They're inefficient. They have people that are under authoritarian control. 'If you look back to what the Chinese did, they probably had this in the late fall, especially early winter.' 'Instead of like calling people in and learning how to help and develop a way for us to know how to treat this, they downplayed it.' China has already taken great offence at comments by U.S. officials accusing it of being slow to react to the virus, first detected in Wuhan late last year, and of not being transparent enough. A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry suggested on Thursday the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, which has been hardest hit by the outbreak, doubling down on a war of words with Washington. But Nunes, referring to Dr Li Wenliang, said Sunday: 'Think about it, the doctor that actually was the whistleblower on this ended up dead.' Dr Li was punished for sounding the alarm over the coronavirus outbreak before it spread and then died of the infection last month. Four more medics at Wuhan Central Hospital where he worked have since lost their lives to the fast-spreading contagion in the space of a month or so. COVID19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed 60 people in the United States and infected more than 3,200 people as of Sunday afternoon. Nunes also said the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has been 'looking at China for a very long time' adding: 'We are building legislation now that is based off of our investigation.' US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has already referred to coronavirus as the 'Wuhan virus', prompting Beijing to reject the term as 'despicable' and 'disrespecting science'. While Kevin McCarthy, a US congressman, called the virus the 'Chinese coronavirus' on Twitter. In a tweet on Monday, he wrote: 'Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus can be found on one, regularly-updated website.' He was sharing the link to the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Wednesday, U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said the speed of China's reaction to the emergence of the coronavirus had probably cost the world two months when it could have been preparing for the outbreak. 'Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,' O'Brien said Wednesday during an appearance at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. O'Brien added that as a result 'it probably cost the world community two months to respond.' 'There's lot of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation or that sort of thing,' he said at Heritage. 'So that the word of this virus could not get out.' 'We have done a good job responding to it but ... the way that this started out in China, and the way it was handled from the outset, was not right,' said O'Brien. In a strongly worded tweet, written in English on his verified Twitter account, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it was the United States that lacked transparency. 'When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!' Zhao wrote. He added: 'We hope certain US officials could focus on domestic response & international cooperation instead of trying to shift the blame to China by denigrating Chinese efforts to fight the epidemic. This is immoral & irresponsible, & will not help mitigate COVID-19 in US.' Zhao's fellow Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also criticized U.S. officials for 'immoral and irresponsible' comments that blamed Beijing's response to the coronavirus for worsening the global impact of the pandemic. Asked about O'Brien's comments, Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing on that such remarks by U.S. officials would not help U.S. epidemic efforts. China's efforts to slow the spread had bought the world time to prepare against the epidemic, he added. Chinese Ambassador to South Africa Lin Songtian also tweeted on March 7: 'Although the epidemic first broke out in China, it did not necessarily mean that the virus is originated from China, let alone ""made in China"".' The coronavirus emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. But in recent weeks the vast majority of new cases have been outside China. The Chinese authorities credit firm measures they took in January and February, including to a near total shutdown of Hubei, for preventing outbreaks in other Chinese cities on the scale of Wuhan and slowing the spread abroad. The administration of President Donald Trump has pointed to a decision to limit air travel from China at the end of January to fend off criticism that it responded too slowly to the disease. Critics say Trump played down the disease in public and the federal government was slow to roll out tests. China's richest man Jack Ma, worth Â£31.6billion, announced Friday he is donating one million face masks and 500,000 coronavirus test kits to the United States to help the world's largest economy fight the outbreak, which has killed at least 5,000 people worldwide. The WHO warns against naming infectious diseases in a way that encourages discrimination against ethnic groups. "
7,New York City schools will CLOSE this week,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114889/New-York-City-schools-CLOSE.html,"New York City schools will be closing this week after Mayor Bill de Blasio faced immense pressure to shut them down as the coronavirus continues to spread through the Big Apple. The announcement was made on Sunday by Melissa DeRosa, the secretary to Governor Andrew Cuomo, in a tweet. 'Gov Cuomo announced Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk & NYC schools will close w/ childcare for essential workers & food programs,' DeRosa wrote. 'NYC must have a plan for childcare &food in place within the next 24 hours Schools will close in NYC early this week; Nassau/SUFFOLK/Westchester tomorrow.' Just minutes after DeRosa made the announcement on Twitter, Cuomo called for all downstate schools to be closed in a tweet of his own. 'This action is necessary to reduce density and mitigate the spread of#COVID19,' Cuomo said. A shut down of the nationâ€™s largest public school district seemed inevitable Sunday as de Blasio lost key support to keep schools open. The Democratic governor said in an afternoon conference call with reporters that he thought it prudent to do so as soon as a plan was in place to ensure that children of health care workers would be cared for. Cuomo spoke shortly after county officials shut schools in Long Island and, across the state, in all of Erie County, including Buffalo."
8,Forget about the coronavirus crisis - I've got a crony to pardon! Donald Trump says he's considering 'full pardon' for his disgraced national security adviser Mike Flynn claiming the FBI 'destroyed his life',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114535/Trump-considering-pardon-ex-adviser-Michael-Flynn.html,"President Donald Trump said on Sunday he is considering a full pardon for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about dealings with Russia's ambassador before Trump took office. Flynn sought to withdraw the guilty plea in January, arguing that prosecutors violated his rights and duped him into a plea agreement. Trump said the FBI and Justice Department had 'destroyed' Flynnâ€™s life and that of his family, and cited an unspecified, unsubstantiated report that they had lost records related to Flynn. 'I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!' Trump said on Twitter, citing an unspecified report that the Department of Justice had lost records pertaining to Flynn. Flynn was supposed to help cooperate with the government as part of his plea deal. But he later switched lawyers and tactics, arguing that prosecutors in the case had violated his rights and tricked him into lying about his December 2016 conversations with Sergei Kislyak, then Moscowâ€™s ambassador in Washington. The Department of Justice has repeatedly denied allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and US District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan rejected all of Flynnâ€™s claims in December and set a sentencing date. Shortly after that, Flynn filed the motion to withdraw his plea. Flynn, who also previously led the Defense Intelligence Agency, served just 24 days in the Republican Trump administration before he was fired in January 2017. He was one of several former Trump aides to plead guilty or be convicted at trial in former Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation that detailed Moscowâ€™s interference in the 2016 US election to boost Trumpâ€™s candidacy, as well as numerous contacts between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia."
9,Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to meet at first one-on-one debate as host network CNN sets podiums six feet apart to keep candidates safe from coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114245/Joe-Biden-Bernie-Sanders-meet-one-one-debate.html,"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will meet for their first one-on-one debate Sunday night on a stage and in a political climate that is vastly different from their last encounter three weeks ago. Fears about the spread of the coronavirushave transformed the event. Its location has been moved from a convention center in Phoenix, Arizona, to a soundstage in Washington D.C. where there will be no studio audience for the candidates to react to. Additionally the candidates will stay six feet apart, as recommended as part of 'social distancing.' 'The podiums are placed 6 feet apart, in accordance with CDC guidelines,' CNN tweeted with a photo of the podiums on the debate stage. Sanders and Biden have each offered their own responses to the coronavirus outbreak - making speeches outlining their plan after President Donald Trump's address to the nation failed to calm fears. And both Democratic contenders have canceled campaign rallies in favor of virtual events to try and stem the spread of the disease. The Vermont senator used his address to make another push for his universal healthcare - Medicaid for All - plan. He also called for free treatment for the virus and for expanded anti-hunger initiatives to help the poor. Biden's plan calls for free testing and additional treatment options. He also called for paid sick leave for anyone affected by the virus. And he pushed for a 'health crisis food initiative' that would benefit children who receive free meals at schools, which have now closed. Sunday's debate could be the last in the Democratic primary process. The two white men in their 70s are the last candidates standing in a Democratic primary field that started out with more than 20 candidates that contained a mix of gender, race and age. And the debate is the last chance for them to make their case before four states -Arizona, Ohio, Illinois and Florida - go the polls. Biden leads in polling in those four states and a series of wins there would increase pressure on Sanders to drop out in order to allow the party to rally around a nominee to take on President Trump this fall. CNN'sJake Tapper and Dana Bash are moderating along with Univision's Ilia CalderÃ³n - who stepped in after her colleague Jorge Ramos withdrew from moderating because of possible exposure to the coronavirus. It begins at 8 p.m. ET. Biden enters the debate as the front runner for the nomination and the pressure will be on the former vice president to give a commanding performance when he has flubbed in previous settings. But Sanders faces his last chance to appeal to Democratic voters before Tuesday's contests. Additionally, he has indicated he will push Biden hard on a number of issues that concern his progressive base of supporters. The Vermont senator showed his hand last week when he said in a speech he'd like to question Biden onhealthcare costs, immigration and climate change. And, in a 'fireside chat' on Saturday night, Sanders, seated next to a fireplace with hiscampaign manager Faiz Shakir, said he would blast Biden for his support from wealthy donors, an attack line he has used effectively against other Democratic candidates. 'Joe has been part of the establishment for a very long time. Joe, what role have you played in trying to make sure we end this massive level of income and wealth inequality?' Sanders said. Sunday's night debate will be a stark contrast to the last event. There were seven candidates on stage at the last debate, which took place in Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 25. Since then, five have dropped out:Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren. Bloomberg, Buttigieg, and Klobuchar have all endorsed Biden. The former vice president has made a play for liberals - and the blessing of Warren - when, in a virtual town hall on Friday night, he announced his support for Warren'sbankruptcy plan, which would simplify the bankruptcy process, Biden pointed out the Massachusetts senator's' plan is 'one of the things that I think Bernie and I will agree on.' Warren has yet to endorse but her blessing would give either candidate a major boost - giving Biden the support of liberals or Sanders more staying power in the race. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard remains in the Democratic primary race. But the Democratic National Committee tightened the qualifications for Sunday's debate and said a candidate needed at least 20 percent of the delegates that have been awarded to qualify. Gabbard only has two delegates."
10,"Social media shames 'greedy, selfish' price-gouging brothers for selling $1 hand sanitizer for up to $70 each before they were shut down by Amazon - leaving them with 17,700 bottles and nowhere to sell them",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113985/Social-media-shames-greedy-price-gouging-brothers-selling-1-hand-sanitizer-70-each.html,"Two Tennessee brothers who bought 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer and sold some of them for as much as $70 each to profit off the coronavirus outbreak say they have received death threats after being shamed on social media. Matt and Noah Colvin of Hixson, Tenneseee, drove 1,300 miles across the state and neighboring Kentucky earlier this month after the first coronavirus death was reported in the United States. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, they filled a U-Haul truck with thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer and thousands of packs of antibacterial wipes that they â€˜cleaned outâ€™ from various Dollar Tree, Walmart, Staples and Home Depot locations. In total, they spent between $10,000 and $15,000 stocking up on the items which are now in demand thanks to the global pandemic that has killed thousands and will likely infect many more. 'The bulk of it was purchased just driving around to retail stores in the Chattanooga area,' Matt Colvin told WRCB-TV. Matt Colvin then stayed at his home near Chattanooga, where he was expecting deliveries of boxes of even more sanitizer, cleansing products, and surgical masks. Colvin told The New York Times that he began listing some of the products on Amazon - and was selling them at a considerable markup. â€˜It was crazy money,â€™ he told the Times. Colvin, like other online resellers, bought the items at the store for reasonably priced sums. A bottle of Purell hand sanitizer normally sells for $1 each. On Amazon, he charged $20 for a two-pack set, according to the Times. Colvin defended himself against accusations he was price gouging, saying that the cost of delivering it to customers as well as Amazon's commission eat into profits. He said that anti-price gouging laws in Tennessee and elsewhere are not suitable to the current digital age. 'Theyâ€™re built for Billy Bobâ€™s gas station doubling the amount he charges for gas during a hurricane,' Colvin said of the laws currently on the books. 'Just because it cost me $2 in the store doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not going to cost me $16 to get it to your door,' he said. When asked if he felt badly about turning a profit by selling products that prevent the spread of a lethal virus, Colvin countered that he was just correcting 'inefficiencies in the marketplace.' 'Thereâ€™s a crushing overwhelming demand in certain cities right now,' he said. 'The Dollar General in the middle of nowhere outside of Lexington, Kentucky, doesnâ€™t have that.' Colvin then claimed that he was simply running a business that was meeting consumer demand. 'I honestly feel like itâ€™s a public service,' he added. 'Iâ€™m being paid for my public service.' Amazon, however, put a stop to it, pulling his items as well as thousands of other listings for hand sanitizer, toilet paper, and antibacterial wipes. The online retailer warned its sellers that it would cancel their accounts entirely if they continued their price gouging. Colvin was then left with a supply of nearly 18,000 bottles of hand sanitizer and thousands of packages of wipes and nowhere to sell them - at a time when store shelves were emptied out and people were frantically looking to buy them. Colvin told the Times that after Amazon shut him down, he would look to sell the products locally. 'If I can make a slight profit, thatâ€™s fine,' he said. 'But Iâ€™m not looking to be in a situation where I make the front page of the news for being that guy who hoarded 20,000 bottles of sanitizer that Iâ€™m selling for 20 times what they cost me.' But the harsh backlash on social media prompted Colvin to reconsider. He said he would instead look to donate the products. Thousands of independent and third-party sellers like Colvin have bought up large quantities of cleaning products and sold them online through platforms like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and other sites. Those companies, however, are working to crack down on the practice. After the Times posted its report on the Colvin brothers, social media users reacted with fury. The avalanche of negative reaction prompted the Colvin brothers to pledge to donate the inventory they have to those in need. The Colvins also deleted their social media accounts. Matt Colvin also posted a web site with the message: 'The Hand Sanitizer in the NYT story is being donated to a local church and first responders tomorrow.' â€˜Thanks for outing this guy and hurray for public pressure,â€™ one Twitter user wrote to the Times reporter who posted the story. Another resident of Hixson tweeted: â€˜This morning I Tweeted I would make sure everyone in my town would know Matt & Noah Colvinâ€™s names by the end of the day. â€˜I emailed the local newspaper this morning to reach out to him to do the right thing. â€˜They contacted me and they have reporters on it.â€™ Others on Twitter who were outraged by the story doubted that the Colvin brothers were sincere about donating the unsold items. One Twitter user blasted the brothers as â€˜conmenâ€™ and â€˜snake oil salesmenâ€™ and suggested that there was a more proper way to â€˜handleâ€™ them besides â€˜suing them in court.â€™ Another Twitter user tweeted: â€˜When you are forced to do the right thing, is it really doing the right thing?â€™ One Twitter user said the Colvinsâ€™ pledge to donate the unsold items was too little, too late. â€˜Too late, dude just ruined his entire life,â€™ the Twitter user wrote. â€˜Now every time he or his kid Googles his name, heâ€™s gonna come up as the Great Value Martin Shkreli.â€™ Shkreli is the former 'pharma bro' who became notorious for raising the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by more than 5,000% while serving as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, now known as Phoenixus AG. He is serving a prison sentence after he was convicted of defrauding investors in his hedge funds and conspiring to manipulate the stock of Retrophin Inc, a biotechnology company he ran. After facing the massive public backlash, Matt Colvin told the Chattanooga Times Free Press that he is looking to donate everything. â€˜I'm trying to figure out where to donate it to,â€™ he said. â€˜I didn't anticipate the magnitude of what was going to be happening now.â€™ Colvin agreed to speak to the Times and to get his story out because he believed he was among other independent vendors who were frustrated by not being able to sell their inventory. Instead, he became the poster boy for profiteering off of the suffering of others. â€˜The amount of hate has been unreal,â€™ he said. â€˜It's been a disaster. People are tweeting guillotines at me.â€™ Colvin told the Times Free Press that he spent much of Saturday searching for a public health agency or hospital willing to take the products. He says he has even had people contact him who were willing to buy them. â€˜I've had a dozen serious offers to buy it,â€™ he said. â€˜I just want to get it to someone who can get it to someone who can use it.â€™ Colvin said that he has been a full-time online reseller for the last five years. His online shops sell products ranging from candy, kidsâ€™ toys, and dog treats. Colvin tries to anticipate marketplace trends and consumer demand so that he knows what to offer the public for sale. The brothers said that they never anticipated the situation becoming so dire that they would face such intense backlash. â€˜Did any of us think we'd be where we are right now?â€™ he said. â€˜I wouldn't be running around trying to get this stuff right now.â€™ The brothers managed to sell just 200 bottles of hand sanitizer before Amazon derailed their plans. The Colvins said they just needed a few more days and they would have gotten rid of their inventory. â€˜If Amazon had let us keep selling for four more days, we'd be done with it - it would be gone,â€™ he said. Instead, the Colvins are being scorned publicly. Some have even gone to the trouble of calling pizza delivery services and ordering boxes of pies under their name. â€˜I went viral on the web this morning and people have been playing pranks on me all day,â€™ he told one pizza delivery driver. â€˜I'm sorry, man. Domino's and Pizza Hut called first, so maybe let them know back at the store not to come here today.â€™ As for the items, he said: â€˜If donating the product stops the death threats, it's worth it.â€™ The public outrage prompted the Tennessee attorney general to threaten the Colvin brothers with legal action if they kept on buying medical products. â€˜We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it,â€™ said Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III. The coronavirus outbreak prompted Tennesseeâ€™s governor, Bill Lee, to declare a state of emergency. The declaration automatically triggers anti-price gouging laws that forbid vendors from inflating their prices during an emergency. Just as news of the coronavirus outbreak was being reported nationwide, Tennessee also suffered casualties from powerful tornadoes which left some 24 people dead."
11,"Nike closes all stores in US, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in response to coronavirus outbreak",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114043/Nike-close-stores-U-S-countries.html,"Sportswear giant Nike Inc said on Sunday it is closing all of its stores in the United States and several other countries to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Nike stores in Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand will be closed from March 16 to 27, the company said in a statement. However, Nike-owned stores in South Korea, Japan, most of China and in many other countries are currently open and will continue their normal operations. 'We are taking additional steps in other Nike-managed facilities, including the option to work from home,' it added. Earlier this month Nike had temporarily closed its European headquarters in Netherlands after an employee was infected with the coronavirus. Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc, which owns brands including Anthropologie and Free People, said on Saturday it was closing all its consumer stores worldwide until at least March 28. However, retailers including Macy's Inc, Saks Fifth Avenue and Gap Inc's Banana Republic sent notices to shoppers last week saying they were open for business in a move to stem losses due to a steep drop in store traffic. Nike isn't the only sporting goods brand that is feeling the pinch from coronavirus. Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted said the outbreak of the pathogen and the fallout has dealt his company 'a painful setback.' Rorsted says that foot traffic to his company's stores has dropped dramatically as a result of quarantine measures and lockdowns in Asia, Europe, and the United States. 'In the sporting goods industry, you are really at the end of the food chain,' Rorsted told CNBC. During an emergency, consumers will be more focused on existential needs like food, medicine, and urgent supplies, rather than sneakers or yoga pants. 'That is what we are seeing so far in the first quarter,' Rorsted said. DailyMail.com has reached out to Adidas to inquire about the company's plans for its stores in light of the global pandemic. Adidas said its sales would fall by $1billion in greater China, hitting operating profit by up to $540million. Further falls in demand in South Korea and Japan will contribute to a 10 per cent drop in first-quarter sales, compared with last year. Puma has also warned on profits, adding it did not expect business to return to normal soon. 'The virus hit looks worse than feared,' Jefferies analyst James Grzinic wrote in a note on Adidas, whose clients include Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. Shares in Adidas and Puma, pummeled in the past few weeks, fell 8 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively. Puma said: 'We unfortunately conclude that a short-term normalization will not occur.' Sporting events around the world have been cancelled, postponed or played without spectators, with the virus's spread raising questions about the viability of the upcoming Olympic Games in Japan and Euro 2020 soccer championship. While the Olympics is not usually a major driver of sales for the sporting goods industry, Euro 2020 is more important for sales of replica jerseys and balls. If both events are postponed, Adidas could lose up to 70 million euros of sales, Rorsted told journalists, but added he was upbeat about the underlying health of the business and was not planning any job cuts. Adidas, which last month warned its business in the greater China area had dropped by about 85 per cent year-on-year in the period since China's Lunar New Year on January 25, said about half of its 12,000 stores in China were open again. But both companies noted a deterioration in markets such as Japan and South Korea, where Chinese tourists often travel to shop, and in Europe. Adidas Finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said he expects a return to normal in the second half of the year, adding that the company had not yet cut orders to factories. Adidas and Puma said most of their factories in China were operating again. Puma said its outbound logistics from China were also mostly in operation, so its global supply chain was only seeing some minor delays. Excluding the impact from the virus, Adidas forecast currency-neutral sales to increase by between 6 per cent and 8 per cent for the full year and for its operating margin to rise by between 10.5 per cent and 11.8 per cent. Fourth-quarter sales - covering a period before the coronavirus took hold - rose a currency-adjusted 10 per cent to $6.5billion, while operating profit came in at $273million, missing analysts' mean forecasts. Currency-neutral sales grew 18 per cent in greater China, 10 per cent in North America and 14 per cent in Europe, the latter a big rebound from declines in the first half of 2019 after the firm took steps to reduce its reliance on its Originals fashion line."
12,US is NOT headed for a recession says Steven Mnuchin - Treasury secretary makes extraordinary claim in the middle of coronavirus crisis after the worst week on Wall Street since the Great Recession,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114099/U-S-NOT-headed-recession-says-Steven-Mnuchin-admits-slowdown-inevitable.html,"Steven Mnuchin said Sunday morning that the U.S. is not heading for a recession, despite his admission that the markets will experience a 'slowdown' from the fall out from the coronavirus outbreak. 'I don't think so,' Mnuchin told ABC This Week when asked if a recession was likely. 'The real issue is not the economic situation today,' the Treasury secretary insisted. 'This is a unique situation. We are going to have a slowdown. Later in the year economic activity will pick up as we confront this virus.' He also asserted that Americans shouldn't focus on the daily ups and downs and 'mood' of the stock market. The Dow saw a rocky few days, dropping thousands of points throughout the week, with a slight reprieve Tuesday as Trump promised a bipartisan economic stimulus package with a trip to Capitol Hill. Markets saw its biggest of the week on Thursday, plummeting 2,000 points the day after Donald Trump's Oval Office address, where he announced he was shutting down travel from Europe and mistakenly claimed that would affect cargo â€“ which was interpreted by investors to mean trade goods between Europe and the U.S. The 10 per cent plunge caused markets to see its worst close since 1987 â€“ and the week was the worst since the recession following the 2008 crash. Friday, however, the markets saw a major recovery nearly 2,000 points as Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's fruitful negotiations brought a bipartisan bill to the House floor. 'I think what you saw is the stock market reacting very positively to the bipartisan bill,' Mnuchin told ABC's Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl Sunday morning. 'The stock market is going to go up, it's going to go down. We can't focus on every day â€“ the mood,' he said. Trump expressed his support for the bipartisan measure on Friday in a tweet ahead of the House vote. Mnuchin is a member of the Trump administration's coronavirus task force. He and Pelosi have a close relationship and have struck bipartisan agreements in the past. The two engaged in several conversations this week to reach an agreement on a bill after Trump continuously pushed for a payroll tax cut, which Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed disinterest in including in the package. Mnuching also responded Sunday to confusion over the 'cargo' halt mentioned in Trump's speech. 'I don't think in an Oval Office address you can address every single issues as you're discussing it,' Mnuchin claimed. 'I don't think he got things wrong at all,' he continued. 'And we were very clear that people misinterpreted the comment on cargo. And we immediately put out a statement to clarify that.'"
13,"Looming crisis threatening the US: Black and Latino workers to be hit hardest by coronavirus as their hours are cut, while others must risk the virus with no insurance or stay at home with no payÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113989/Coronavirus-going-impact-black-hispanic-people-no-access-sick-leave-insurance.html,"The coronavirus outbreak is expected to have the worst impact on the black and Hispanic populations. Donald Trump has enforced a travel ban and declared COVID-19 a national pandemic, banning gathering of more than 500 people and leading to the cancellations of major events, as more than 3,000 cases of have been confirmed in the US. With self-quarantining actions in place, low-wage workers in the industries that rely on tips or have zero-hour contracts, are being forced to decide between immediately cutting their income by missing shifts without sick leave, or showing up to work and risking infection. The travel and leisure and hospitality industries are suffering due to the outbreak, hotel employees have especially noticed. Trump has also announced tax cut plans to relieve the economic pressures from employees and employers but House Democrats have blasted the moves for failing to take into account the groups who are more likely to miss out on payment altogether due to unemployment. The unemployment rate is higher among black people no matter the education level or age, and on average, the time it takes for black workers to obtain employment tends to be longer. To add further injury, studies have found that lower-wage workers are 'less likely to stay home if they are experiencing symptoms', the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) senior economist Elise Gould has said. A 2016 Yale study found that the poor are twice as likely to get ill from the flu than those who live in wealthier areas. It comes as the country steps up moves to prevent the community spread of coronavirus and the number of confirmed cases increases. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended that companies allow workers to carry out their jobs from remote locations where possible. However Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS) statistics show of people who could from from home, a higher percentage of white people, 25.6 percent, (compared to 17.6 percent of black people). New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has advised commuters avoid riding the subway unless absolutely necessary. However the black and Hispanic populations are twice as likely to be in the lower-income group and those workers are less likely to have the option to work from home. Speaking about workers who rely on tipping, EPI senior economist Gould said: 'It's a little bit of a snowball effect for that population. They are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck, and will have a harder time because they have limited resources. 'This is highlighting the vast inequality in this country. And some people are going to get hurt so much more than others. That hurt could be long lasting. We don't know. We don't know what's going to happen over the course of this virus.' Officials have said they expect the pandemic to last at least six months. Only a third (29 percent) of the workforce in the United States is able to work from home, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In the hospitality and leisure industries only 9 percent have the ability to work from home. By comparison over 50 percent of workers in information, financial activities, and professional and business services can work from home. BLS states 32 million workers in the United States don't have access to paid sick leave. The BLS states that 92 percent of higher-income workers get paid sick leave. Of the lower salaried earners only 10 per received paid sick leave. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) states that only 48 percent of workers in the leisure and hospitality sectors have paid sick leave. The quarantine time for coronavirus is 14 days. Furthermore Roxana Rivera, vice president of local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union told the Boston Globe: 'Workers shouldn't have to burn through their sick days and be forced to go without pay if they catch the coronavirus, particularly when the cause is their own workplace.' Rivera represents hundreds of airport workers. According to stats from 2017, the working-poor rate for both black people and Latino or Hispanic groups was 7.9 percent â€“ compared to 3.9 percent for white people. Black or African American women were worst off, with 10 percent classified as working-poor. That's compared to 9 percent of Hispanic women and only 3.5 percent white men. Of the total working-poor populations, 36 percent were employed in service occupations (2.3 million) made of the group. Among those employed in natural resources, construction, and maintenance occupations, 6.0 percent were classified as working poor. 'There's a lot of occupational segregation in this country,' Gould explained. 'So when we think of those low-wage workers they're more likely to be women, black and Hispanic workers. This could hit some communities more than others. 'We don't know what will happen when people can't pay their rent or their mortgage. Will we see the economic devastation spread? Will the government step up?' The House introduced the Families First Coronavirus Response Act this week and the bill that would provide food assistance, paid sick leave, and extra funds for unemployment insurance benefits. Betania Shephard, 33, told the Philadelphia Inquirer she was already losing work. The mother-of-two earns an hourly wage and has failed to secure enough work since the outbreak. 'We don't have health insurance, so things are complicated, because if we go to the doctor, we have to pay cash,' Shephard said. 'If I'm not working, how can I pay those bills?' Elsewhere in Philadelphia, Robyn Thornton, a housekeeper at the Hilton Garden Inn by Reading Terminal Market, is a 35-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy who has been placed on call and is concerned about paying her rent and bills. 'When I don't have the funding to be able to pay rent, it's like, the landlord don't wanna hear that,' she said. In the state where gatherings of 1,000 people or more have been banned, said Dermot Delude-Dix, a research analyst with UNITE HERE said: 'The majority of our local is out of work right now.' Delude-Dix is concerned that people being laid off will not be able to get treated for coronavirus is they are unemployed. 'Our position is, no one should lose their health insurance because of the coronavirus,' Delude-Dix added. Ed Grose, executive director of the Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association, said that hotels that used to have occupancy rates of around 80 percent are down to 30 percent, or even as low as 10 percent for those that relied on occupancy from hosting large gatherings. He said a hotel manager there was concerned he wouldn't be able to pay staff until the end of next month. 'They are doing their best to make sure that their folks are taken care of,' Grose said, 'but there is not much they can do when you're looking at rock-bottom occupancy rates.' In Philadelphia all schools were closed Friday. It has meant lower-income families suffer financially even more as they have to make the choice to stay home and take care of their children or head out to work and risk getting ill. 'I earn too little to pay a babysitter,' she said. 'I don't know what my options would be.' It prompted Ayesha and Steph Curry to address the strain the COVID-19 pandemic is having on low income families who reply on school meals to feed their children for one or two meals a day. The basketball star and his culinary expert wife's Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation is working with the Alameda County Community Food Bank in Oakland California, which counts Hispanic and black populations as the main clientele. 'We know the world is changing before our eyes in terms of dealing with the spread of coronavirus and we just found out that the Oakland Unified School District is closing the doors for the foreseeable future, so we want to intercede on behalf of the kids that rely on the daily services and try to help anyway we can,' Steph said in a video shared on social media. A total of 29.7 million children benefit from the National School Lunch Program. 'The statistics are really staggering. At least 18,000 kids rely on at least two meals a day from the school system, so we want to make sure that we rally around everyone and ensure that these kids are not wondering where their next meal is coming from,' Alesha added. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence announced that any American can be tested for coronavirus as long as a doctor approves it. The move appears to expand upon previous criteria needed for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But how do you determine if you have symptoms ofCOVID-19 and when you should see a doctor? We break down everything you need to know about being tested for the virus that has infected more than 120 Americans and killed at least nine. WHAT ARE THE LATEST GUIDELINES FOR BEING TESTED? There are three groups of people that the CDC recommends get tested. 1. People with symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath who have been in 'close contact' with someone confirmed to have coronavirus 2. Patients with symptoms who have traveled to areas affected by the virus within the last 14 days 3. Those with symptoms who need to be hospitalized and no other cause for their illness is found. They don't need to have a travel history or exposure to another patient HOW DOES THIS DIFFER FROM THE PREVIOUS CRITERIA? When the CDC first began testing, only those with a travel history to China - where the outbreak emerged - or those who had been exposed to a confirmed coronavirus patient were tested. However, the agency says its criteria for testing is always 'subject to change as additional information becomes available.' WHAT TO DO IF YOU NEED A TEST? Health officials strongly advise that anyone who believes they may be infected not show up unannounced at their doctor's office in case they expose others to the highly-contagious disease. Instead, the CDC suggests immediately calling your physician or healthcare provider. 'Your healthcare professional will work with your state's public health department and CDC to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19,' the CDC's website states. If you are suspected of having the virus, you will most likely get tested at a hospital. The test involves getting a swab of the patient's nostril and throat. If the patient has a wet cough, a sample of sputum (a mixture of saliva and mucus) will also be collected. WHY HAS IT BEEN DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET TESTED? There have been multiple reports of people not having accessing to get tested. The first batch of test kits that the CDC sent to state and local health departments were faulty, which led to a delay. Secondly, the CDC had strict criteria for testing, which led to missed diagnoses of people who caught the virus from so-called 'community spread,' meaning it's unknown how they were infected. A third reasonis that some health departments did not leave the decision to test up to doctors as the CDC suggested. For instance, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health initially required doctors to call a hotline to determine if their patients met CDC criteria for testing. Then, before the test could be administered, it had to be authorized at the State Public Health Lab. WILL IT BE EASIER TO GET TESTED NOW? Since the CDC's testing fiasco, several health departments have either received new kits from the federal agency or made their own. Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) policy so allow more labs can apply for approval to test for the virus. The CDC that 75,000 test kits are currently available and more are being manufactured. FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Han told reporters on Monday that close to one million people would be testedby the end of the week. But figures from the Association of Public Health Laboratories show that likely no more than 100,000 people would be tested by week's end."
14,Donald Trump observes National Day of Prayer for Americans affected by coronavirus outbreak by tuning into Georgia church service via livestream,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114401/Donald-Trump-observes-National-Day-Prayer-tuning-Georgia-church-service-livestream.html,"President Donald Trump observed Sunday's National Day of Prayer for Americans affected by the killer coronavirus by livestreaming a local Georgia church service. The president announced the special day over the weekend saying, 'In our greatest need, Americans have always turned to prayer to help guide us through trials and periods of uncertainty'. Although most religious services have ceased congregating due to the coronavirus outbreak which has infected over 3,000 nation-wide and led to at least 58 deaths, many are turning to livestreams to worship. The president tuned into a sermon byPastor Jentezen Franklin of Free Chapel Church in Gainesville, Georgia on Sunday morning. Trump tweeted: 'Today is National Day of Prayer. God Bless everyone!' He followed up saying: I am watching a great and beautiful service by Pastor Jentezen Franklin. Thank you!' Pastor Franklin tweeted his thanks saying: 'Honored and thankful President @realDonaldTrump! Praying for you.' Trump first announced the special day of prayer on Friday. 'No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!' he tweeted. 'I ask you to join me in a day of prayer for all people who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and to pray for Godâ€™s healing hand to be placed on the people of our Nation,' the president wrote in a statement shared Saturday. He asked the public to think about the doctors, researchers, and first responders who put their lives on the line in response to the coronavirus outbreak. 'I now encourage all Americans to pray for those on the front lines of the response, especially our Nationâ€™s outstanding medical professionals and public health officials who are working tirelessly to protect all of us from the coronavirus and treat patients who are infected; all of our courageous first responders, National Guard, and dedicated individuals who are working to ensure the health and safety of our communities; and our Federal, State, and local leaders,' Trump shared. Earlier that same day he told reporters that he was tested for the COVID-19, after days of dodging the question, and the tests came back negative. On Friday the president declared a national state of emergency allowing him to access $50billion in emergency funds to give to states in need and unveiling drive-thru testing in Walmart, Target and CVS parking lots. Trump has closed American borders to European foreigners in light of the outbreak, as Italy, Spain and France announce lockdowns in their own countries to combat the spreading disease. Churches have seen a surge in online viewership due to the outbreak, CNN Business reports, as locals have been advised to remain indoors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Saint Mark's Episcopal Cathedral based in Seattle said their livestream viewership more than doubled last week. Churchome, the megachurch frequented by celebrities like Justin Beiber, has reported a 60 percent surge in app sign-ups after shuttering its Seattle location."
15,St Patrick's Day is cancelled! Pubs in Ireland are asked to CLOSE until the end of March as second person in the country dies from coronavirus and number of confirmed cases rises to 169,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114547/Pubs-Ireland-asked-CLOSE-end-March.html,"The Republic of Ireland has called on bars and pubs to close until the end of March in an effort to slow down the progression of the coronaviruswhich has now claimed the life of a second person in the country. The plans to help curb the spread of the virus, which come just days before St Patrick's Day, aim to see all public houses and bars close from this evening until at least March 29. The government's move comes as the virus claimed the life of a second person in the country and 40 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed - bringing the total number of people affected in the Republic to 169. Among the new cases, which include 23 males and 17 females, 25are associated with the east of the country, nine are associated with the west and six are associated with the south. In a statementthe Government said: 'Following discussions today with the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) and the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Government is now calling on all public houses and bars (including hotel bars) to close from this evening (March 15) until at least March 29. 'The LVA and VFI outlined the real difficulty in implementing the published Guidelines on Social Distancing in a public house setting, as pubs are specifically designed to promote social interaction in a situation where alcohol reduces personal inhibitions. 'For the same reason, the Government is also calling on all members of the public not to organise or participate in any parties in private houses or other venues which would put other peoples' health at risk.' The plans comes as Dublin's Temple Bar announced a complete shutdown of all its bars and nightclubs with immediate effect. The move means no bars will be open in the area for St Patrick's Day, one of the busiest days in the Irish tourism calendar. Martin Harte, of the Temple Bar Company, said the decision was taken voluntarily and that 'this is the owners of all pubs sitting down and deciding this is the best thing to do in terms of public health and safety'. Mr Harte said the problem is that social distancing and limiting of numbers is impossible to enforce in bars. It comes as the Irish Government may seek enforcement powers to ensure that the ban on indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people applies to pubs and clubs. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has urged people who socialised in pubs and clubs at the weekend to avoid the elderly and people with chronic diseases, to stop the spread of Covid-19. The new virus, called COVID-19,is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms including a sore throat, headache, fever, cough or trouble breathing. Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure. He tweeted: 'No indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people applies to pubs & clubs. Have asked NPHET for further expert guidance on this. May seek enforcement powers from Dail/Seanad.' His message comes despite restrictions on mass gatherings in the Republic of Ireland and guidelines on social distancing. On Saturday night, Health Service Executive chief Paul Reid also urged pubs to 'wise up quick' after videos of people crowding into them. Some pubs and bars across the country have voluntarily opted to temporarily close as the Department of Health advised people should try to keep two metres between themselves and others. On Sunday morning, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said: 'The advice on what each of us needs to do is clear, we all need to follow that advice, not just for our own health, but for the benefit of all those around us.' 'Each one of us needs to think of vulnerable people in our midst and ask ourselves what we can do to help them through this.' Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald urged people to avoid socialising in pubs and to keep all social contact to a minimum. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill called on the industry to introduce social distancing in Northern Ireland to limit the spread of Covid-19. 'The health of the nation is paramount, as is the health of our staff, but it is also important that we try and ensure people will have jobs to return to once this crisis is over,' he said. On Monday, the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced that all parades and festivals in the Republic would be cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. Some festivals inNorthern Ireland are still set to go ahead but are under reviewover the spread of COVID-19. Latest statistics show that the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland have now risen to 169. It comes as the the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Northern Ireland rose to 45. Meanwhile in Wales there were 34 new cases today, pushing its total to 94. A huge jump from 60. Today it was announced that coronavirus fatalities in the UK have increased by 14 overnightbringing the total death toll to 35 as the number of cases increases by more than 200 to 1,372, the department of health and social care confirmed. A total of40,279 people have been tested across the UK and the latest update comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning said that the elderly may have to self isolate for up to four months. 38,907 tested negative against the disease and 1,372 tested positive. The virus, which initially saw millions of residents and tourists in China put on lock down to contain the spread, has now been transmitted between humans in 30 countries across Europe, including Spain, Germany and France, according to the World Health Organization.

16,"Rich Hamptons residents rush to stockpile huge sums of cash after some New York City's banks run out of $100 bills as customers withdraw $50,000 each amid growing coronavirus panicÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114217/Rich-Hamptons-residents-rush-stockpile-huge-sums-cash.html,"Wealthy Americans have begun trying to withdraw large sums of money to stockpile amid a growing coronavirus panic across the United States. One Chase customer was refused a $30,000 transaction at a branch in the Hamptons on Friday, Bloomberg reports. They were told the limit was $10,000 with additional nearby branches also refusing to complete the large withdrawal. A JPMorgan spokesman said there is enough money is available but large transactions often require additional security. It comes after a Manhattan bank temporarily ran out of $100 bills on Thursday as wealthy customers sought to withdraw large sums of cash as Wall Street suffered its biggest drop in more than 30 years. Despite rebounding Friday on President Donald Trumpâ€™s declaration of a national emergency to try to help stem the health crisis, the stock market remains in a bear market â€” the Dow Jones Industrial Average has shed nearly 22 per cent in just a month â€” which stands to further dim the confidence of consumers. Investors whose stock market wealth shrinks typically become less likely to spend much. Overwhelmingly, caution remains the watchword for investors and analysts reeling from a week that saw all three U.S. exchanges confirm bear markets, oil prices plummet to multiyear lows and wild fluctuations in bond yields and currencies. Daily routines have been upended as businesses, including Amazon, urge employees to work from home, schools and universities close, and sporting events and church services are paused across the country. In response to the run on certain items, major retailers have imposed some purchase limits. Frantic clientele at a Bank of America branch on Park Avenue in Manhattan requested to retrieve tens of thousands of dollars to stockpile, which accounted for the shortage. Two people who witnessed the rush told The New York Times that several people withdrew as much as $50,000. The danger to the U.S. economy stems from a fundamental reality - consumers drive roughly 70 percent of growth. When spending halts, the economy canâ€™t grow. And while online shopping will likely surge as people sequester themselves at home, such purchases still account for just a small fraction of overall consumer spending. Compounding the threat, the very measures that are required to contain the outbreak â€” quarantines, reduced travel, an avoidance of crowds and gatherings â€” are sure to stifle economic activity. The resulting slowdown across the globe has undercut the price of oil, intensifying pressure on energy producers and likely reducing business investment. And many U.S. companies, especially in the airline and energy industries, are heavily indebted and might have to respond to financial pressures by cutting expenses â€” including jobs. On Thursday, the S&P 500 dropped more than nine percent - the largest percentage drop since the 'Black Monday' crash of 1987. A spokesperson for Bank of America said there was only a run on large bills, and customers were able to withdraw smaller notes, including $20 and $50 bills, as normal. 'We don't keep large amounts of cash in big bills in the branches because it's dangerous for our employees and there is low demand,' they stated. $100 bills were replenished at the branch by Friday. The cash grab appears limited to wealthy New Yorkers with stocks, as the Federal Reserve told The Times that overall demand 'has been within fairly normal levels'. The publication reports that an extra $4 billion in cash was withdrawn by anxious Americans following the terror attack on September 11, 2001. However, nearly two decades on, consumers are less likely to make payments in cash, instead using debit cards and smartphones to complete transactions."
17,Here's everything YOU need to know about coronavirus from how to self-isolate to avoiding Covid-19 and protecting your elderly loved ones,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113641/Heres-need-know-coronavirus.html,"The death toll from the coronavirus reached almost 6,000 last night with another 400 lives lost worldwide over the past 24 hours. In Britain, the number of dead doubled, to 21, with the Government set to announce a series of tough emergency measures to try to contain the disease. Across Europe, countries have become crippled and placed in lockdown. In Spain, cases soared from 1,500 to 5,700 and ministers declared an unprecedented two-week state of emergency. France has ordered non-essential locations to close and several nations have closed their borders or shut their airports. With the travel plans of millions already affected, US President Donald Trump last night decreed that all flights from the UK to America are to be banned from tomorrow, in addition to the 26 EU nations previously announced. With the world facing lockdown, here's everything you need to know at a glance. As comfortable as your pyjamas may seem, itâ€™s wise to get properly dressed and adopt a regular routine by differentiating between â€˜workâ€™ and â€˜downâ€™ time. Also, take care of your diet as blood sugar levels affect mood and energy levels. Video conference calls with work colleagues can help stop loneliness. Towards evening, put away your work equipment and change clothes to help psychologically mark the shift to personal time. The death rate for over-80s who contract the virus has been assessed at nearly 15 per cent, according to Chinese data. Anyone over 60 is advised to avoid crowds because the risk of infection may increase in closed settings with little air circulation. In coming weeks, the old and vulnerable may be asked to self-isolate, regardless of symptoms. Children, though, seem relatively unaffected â€“ the vast majority have only mild symptoms. But since they tend to come into contact with far more people, they can spread the virus much more widely. If self-isolating, like Health Minister Nadine Dorries, right, avoid direct human contact. Instead, use video conferencing and social media. Move around as much as possible. If you have a garden, get fresh air regularly but do NOT leave your property. Drink plenty of water and take paracetamol to help alleviate the symptoms. Plan what youâ€™ll need â€“ food, medicines etc â€“ and arrange how they can be obtained. Sign up to online services if you havenâ€™t already. Keep busy with activities. Keep your distance from others you live with, and sleep alone. Use separate towels. Also use a separate bathroom, if possible â€“ but if you canâ€™t, clean it thoroughly after using it. Experts believe the virus can survive on flat surfaces for days unless theyâ€™re disinfected. They advise cleaning your phone with alcohol wipes twice a day. Or use water and soap with a slightly wetted cloth. Donâ€™t use kitchen cleaners, window cleaners or paper towels, which can leave debris and scratch the surface. "
18,New Orleans police clear out bustling Bourbon Street after governor bans gatherings of over 250 people to prevent the spread of coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114393/New-Orleans-police-clear-bustling-Bourbon-Street-prevent-spread-coronavirus.html,"New Orleans police shut down the iconic Bourbon Street on Saturday night, telling revelers to clear out to prevent the spread of the killer coronavirus. The beloved street in the French Quarter is famous for allowing drinking in the streets, its dance clubs, and late-night fun. Police officers ended parties early Saturday night by driving through the streets filled with people and ordering tourists to go home, enforcing a Governor-issued ban on large gatherings. Videos shared on Twitter show multiple police trucks flashing their blue lights and driving through the busy streets on Bourbon Street around 1am Sunday. 'By order of the governor and the mayor, large group of people are prohibited from congregating together,' a cop is heard saying over an intercom speaker. 'Your actions are jeopardizing public health. You are directed to clear the streets and go home and back to your hotel. Thank you for your cooperation.' At least five police vehicles were seen taking over the streets, causing milling crowds to move around them and eventually disperse. Officers mounted on horses were also deployed to move the crowds on and urge locals and tourists to leave packed bars. On Friday Governor John Bel Edwards signed a proclamation banning gatherings of 250 people or more, including public schools, for the next month. Some local business voluntarily started to limit the number of people allowed inside at once. As of Sunday morning there are 91 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Louisiana. Governor Edwards announced the death of a second Louisianan due to the killer virus, a 53-year-old individual with underlying medical conditions. 'Sadly, we have lost our second Louisianan to COVID-19. I ask the people of Louisiana to join us in sending thoughts and prayers to the family members and friends who have lost their loved one,' he tweeted. Officials across the country are buckling down and placing bans on large gatherings, bringing spring break plans for thousands to a screeching halt. New Orleans is a popular destination for spring breakers this month. A similar scene is unfolding in Miami where state and city officials closed down South Beach and announced 'spring break is cancelled', ushering hundreds of college students off the sand in an effort to break up big groups and prevent the potential spread of the virus."
19,"Netherlands will close all schools, bars and restaurants as it becomes the latest country in Europe to go on coronavirus lockdown as the number of infections hits 1,135",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113997/Dutch-government-takes-KLM-going.html,"All Dutch schools, cafes, restaurants and sport clubs were ordered to be closed on Sunday as the number of coronavirus infections hit 1,135 in the Netherlands. Queues quickly built up at 'coffee shops' where cannabis is sold after the announcement, which follows pressure on the government to follow the lead of other European countries. The announcement came as the number of confirmed coronavirus infections in the country rose by 176 to 1,135, with 20 deaths, the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said. The restrictions will remain in place until at least April 6, Education Minister Arie Slob said in a press conference. 'It has become clear that it was impossible for many schools to remain open, as many teachers were already sick at home and because of safety risks,' he said. 'Therefore we have decided to close all schools and daycare centres.' The government asked the country's 17 million residents to keep their distance when leaving the house. 'Do not hoard, it's not necessary there is enough to go around,' Slob said. All saunas, sex clubs, sport schools and marijuana coffee shops were also ordered to close at 1800 (1700GMT) Sunday evening. Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Cabinet had initially resisted closing schools, but changed course after coming under pressure from educators and medical specialists. A letter sent to parents in Amsterdam said Dutch medical professionals had recommended schools be closed and plans were being drawn up in the event the closures would last longer. Healthcare Minister Bruno Bruins said additional measures were likely. 'I am certain these will not be our last measures, the situation keeps developing very rapidly and we will keep deciding on further measures based on the knowledge of experts. 'I cannot speculate on what measures these will be, but it is clear that more will follow.' Rutte was scheduled to address the nation on Monday evening to explain the unprecedented measures. "
20,American Airlines will cut its international flights by 75% until May amid coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113309/U-S-airlines-start-cutting-flights-UK-Ireland-restrictions.html,"American Airlines said Saturday it plans to cut 75% of its international flights through May 6 and ground nearly all its widebody fleet, as airlines respond to the global collapse in travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. The dramatic announcement by the largest U.S. airline came hours after the White House said the United States would widen new travel restrictions on Europeans to include travelers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, starting Monday night. The Trump administration also signaled Saturday it wanted Congress to quickly back financial support for troubled U.S. airlines. American's sweeping cuts include suspending nearly all long-haul international flights to Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand and South America. It will still operate two flights a day to London and just three flights to Asia per week -- to Tokyo. It will continue short-haul international flying. American confirmed it is parking nearly all widebody aircraft and anticipates its domestic capacity will be reduced by 20% in April and 30% in May versus the same period in 2019. United Airlines Co said late Saturday it would begin cutting flights to the United Kingdom, Southwest Airlines moved toward flight cuts and Delta Airlines Inc plans to start cutting flights to the United Kingdom. Southwest, one of the few U.S. airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was ""seriously considering"" cutting flights. While airlines scrambled to stem losses and protect jobs, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government would ""immediately"" start working with Congress to support the airline and cruise industries, both hard hit by the spiraling crisis. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said restrictions on the UK and Ireland will begin Monday at midnight, barring most non-U.S. citizens from entering the United States who have been in those countries within the last 14 days. They do not bar flights to and from the United States, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel. United said it would suspend flights to London from Houston and Denver starting Monday. United said it expects to fly three daily flights to London and one daily flight to Dublin through the end of April. United said it would give a credit for the value of the ticket for any customer whose international travel is disrupted by more than six hours because of schedule changes resulting from government restrictions. Customers who do not use the credit for 12 months will get a refund. Washington first imposed restrictions on China and expanded them this week to continental Europe, prompting U.S. airlines to cut numerous flights and scramble to shore up capital. Among cost-cutting measures, U.S. airlines are offering employees voluntary unpaid leaves of absence to match staffing with flights. The outbreak came as Delta and its pilots' union were in contract negotiations, and the sides reached an agreement on coronavirus-related sick leave and managing overstaffing for April with partially paid schedules. United and Southwest could reach deals with their pilots soon, sources said. On Friday, Delta said it would cut capacity 40% in the next few months, the largest reduction in its history. It will eliminate nearly all flights to continental Europe for 30 days and will park up to 300 aircraft. United also announced cuts to European service this week. On Friday, major U.S. airlines confirmed they had been in talks with the White House and Congress about financial assistance. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Friday called on the government to ""turn next to a package to assist impacted employers... No business should go bankrupt because of a temporary loss in revenue as a result of the coronavirus."" Airlines are reeling from a plunge in bookings and traffic, as the fast-spreading pandemic prompts travel restrictions and event cancellations around the world. U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said on Saturday it was scaling back services due to reduced demand. Last week the company said bookings had plunged 50% since the coronavirus outbreak.

21,Elderly Georgia couple quarantined separately after contracting coronavirus on the Diamond Princess say spending almost three weeks apart was worse than their mild pneumonia and flu-like symptoms,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114701/Diamond-Princess-couple-reunited-separate-coronavirus-quarantines-say-symptoms-werent-bad.html,"An elderly couple from Georgia that was quarantined separately after their trip on board the Diamond Princess has been reunited after the longest time they've ever spent apart from one another. Dale and Sherry Grizzle were parted for nearly three weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak on the cruise ship in Japan and they've said the distance between them was the worst part about being stricken with the illness. A total of 350 passengers tested positive for coronavirus after a passenger who left the cruise in Hong Kong was found to be infected. The vessel docked at Yokohama near Tokyo and Dale had to stay there while Sherry was isolated in Washington after 300 Americans were brought back to the US before the initial quarantine onboard was complete. 'We've never been apart like this before, and it was pretty stressful. That may have been the worst part of the whole deal,' Dale Grizzle, 69, told Fox & Friends Weekend on Sunday. The pair had mild cases of COVID-19 and Sherry only wondered if she had contracted the virus because her spouse was already a confirmed case. Sherry said her symptoms initially resembled a common cold. 'When I first started having symptoms, it was just a mild sore throat and a headache and that lasted for several days. ... I didn't think anything of it, but Dale had already been diagnosed so I began to wonder if maybe I had the virus also,' Sherry added on the show Sunday. But her husband's symptoms were worse. Dale added: 'I ran a fever for about two and a half weeks that I couldn't seem to get rid of, and I developed some pneumonia, a milder case of pneumonia, but pneumonia nonetheless, and it was stubborn, but thankfully it didn't turn into a real bad case so I was able to overcome it.' Now looking a picture of health, Dale has praised the treatment he received and said he was 'very well-cared for'. 'I couldn't have asked for any better care. The team of doctors and nurses that took care of me were absolutely awesome, and I can never thank them enough for the care that I received,' he said. Princess Cruises has already seen two of its vessels hit by the virus and quarantined: the Diamond Princess, which docked in Japan, and the Grand Princess, which docked in California. The decision to quarantine 3,700 passengers and crew on board the Diamond Princess in Japan was heavily criticized after more than 700 people eventually tested positive for the virus. 'The Japanese experience was a sad lesson that keeping people aboard such a ship just spreads the infection through a large number of people, and the boat becomes, basically, an incubator for spread of the disease,' Brian Cox, a New Zealand public health specialist, Brian Cox from the University of Otago, opined to the Associated Press. Removing passengers from the ship and placing them in self-isolation for two weeks was the safest option, he added, and it would be 'inhumane to just turn it around and send it back'."
22,"St. Patrick's Day celebrations are muted across the US after New York, Chicago and Boston all cancel parades while parts of New Jersey are put on lockdown",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113417/St-Patricks-Day-celebrations-eerily-quiet-bars-start-announce-SHUTTING.html,"St Patrick's Day celebrations were muted across the United States over the weekend after New York, Chicago and Boston all canceled their parades while parts of New Jersey were put on lockdown. What should have been one of the busiest weekends of the year in bars throughout America was noticeably quiet as patrons stayed away from public spaces amid growing concerns about the spread of coronavirus. The New York City St. Patrickâ€™s Day Parade was postponed for the first time in its 258-year history, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Wednesday. Its postponement of the March 17 parade adds to the roster of events and holidays upended around the world by the spreading infection. Chicago, Boston, and even the Irish capital of Dublin, have also cancelled St. Patrickâ€™s Day parades. The New York governorâ€™s statement did not say when this yearâ€™s parade will take place, if at all. But Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that he promises the parade will go on, 'whether itâ€™s in the heat of summer or on a clear fall day'. The parade is usually held on March 17th, attracting millions of spectators who line up along Manhattanâ€™s Fifth Avenue to celebrate the patron saint of Ireland. In Chicago, the cityâ€™s mayor said she couldnâ€™t risk the kind of gathering that scientists warn could hasten the further spread of COVID-19. 'Like cities across the nation, we concluded that having a parade at this time posed an unnecessary risk to the publicâ€™s health', Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. The mayor of Savannah, Georgia, later announced that cityâ€™s 196-year-old St. Patrickâ€™s Day parade, scheduled for Tuesday, and a weekend festival had been called off as well. Chicagoâ€™s parade had been scheduled for Saturday, ahead of St. Patrickâ€™s Day on Tuesday. 'We all know what the St. Patrickâ€™s Day celebrations mean to the city of Chicago,â€ said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat. 'Because of what weâ€™ve seen nationally, and across the world, of the increased risk of large gatherings, this was the right call.' Indeed, it was deemed the right call in cities from Boston and Philadelphia to Denver, Dallas, San Francisco and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The cities of Dublin â€” the one in Ohio and the one in Ireland â€” also pulled the plugs on their parades. Officials are considering a statewide curfew to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday morning. Hoboken already implemented one â€” from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. â€” starting Monday. 'These are extremely challenging times, and we are seeing a substantial uptick of positive COVID-19 cases,' Mayor Ravinder Bhalla said in a statement. 'The time is now to to enact proactive policies that will help save lives in the long run.' Gov. Murphy said earlier that the state is preparing for closing schools statewide, though he stopped short of taking that step. He said itâ€™s a matter of when, not if, they close. Education officials said some 354 districts, or roughly half, in the state have closed already. By Saturday evening, the streets of Teaneck were deserted as the town self-isolated with the hope of defeating the coronavirus cluster that has emerged. Teaneck's action comes just days after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a 'containment area' in the city of New Rochelle, where a cluster of cases was traced to a synagogue. The parade cancellations come as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbs. In the U.S., the total has topped 2,900 with 58 deaths. Savannahâ€™s weekend festivities and March 17 parade draw crowds approaching a half million people, potentially more than tripling the size of the 146,000-resident city for a few days. Started by Irish immigrants to Georgiaâ€™s oldest city in 1824, the March 17 parade has ballooned into a massive street party thatâ€™s Savannahâ€™s most profitable tourism draw. The cancelations have led to eerily quiet scenes at some of the country's Irish bars that would normally be teeming with life at this time of year. One New York bar owner told how St. Patrick's Day revenue was enough to equal three months' worth of normal revenue. Some bars are preparing for the worst by cutting staffers' hours, canceling live music events and even shutting at least temporarily while business is so bad. 'It's like canceling Christmas on us,' Patrick McNamee, who runs six Irish bars in the city, told Eater. Jim Gallagher, a manager at Molly's Shebeen, said that St. Patrick's Day will now just be like a 'normal day.' 'It's a big loss for the owners,' he said. Another bar, Joyface, in the East Village is preparing to close for a week, partly to stem losses. There was little to celebrate as the city recorded its first COVID-19 fatality, an 82-year-old woman, on Saturday amid a rapid climb in cases: 200 so far, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo, and more than 1,000 expected next week."
23,New Jersey on lockdown: Hoboken imposes a citywide 10pm curfew and closes ALL of its bars while the town of Teaneck is put in self-quarantine as the state reports 69 coronavirus cases and two deaths,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113319/New-Jersey-town-Teaneck-self-quarantine-18-cases-coronavirus-reported.html,"Northern New Jersey municipalities took steps to stem the outbreak of coronavirus cases Saturday night, as Hoboken decided to close its bars and Teaneck residents were ordered to self-quarantine. Hoboken, a Hudson County city on the Hudson River, announced in a tweet that bars are effectively closed for the foreseeable future as of 11am Sunday. Meanwhile, the residents of the Bergen County township of Teaneck have been ordered into a self-quarantine by its mayor after it became 'ground zero' for thecoronavirusoutbreak in New Jersey. Hoboken, which serves as a late-night hot spot for revelers throughout the region, also announced that bars will no longer be able to serve food within the establishments. Any bar or restaurant that currently offers food will only be allowed to fill takeout orders past Sunday afternoon. 'These are extremely challenging times, and we are seeing a substantial uptick of positive COVID-19 cases,' Mayor Ravinder Bhalla said in a statement. 'The time is now to to enact proactive policies that will help save lives in the long run.' Hoboken also is implementing a citywide curfew from 10 p.m. through 5 a.m., effective Monday. All residents will be restricted to their homes, except for emergencies and if they're required to work. Located just across the Hudson River, six miles fromNew York City, Teaneck had identified 18 cases of the coronavirus by Saturday night as the number in Bergen County jumped to 31. The order to self-quarantine came from Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin, who issued a stark warning to the township's 40,000 residents that they were not to visit each other, even other family members. They were told only to leave their homes for food and medicine as he revealed that officials do not have enough test kits for the rapidly growing number of sick people. Twenty-five percent of New Jersey's overall cases are centered in Teaneck. Several residents have already been taken to Holy Name Hospital in the township. 'There are people that don't understand that this is something we haven't seen since World War II,' Hameeduddin toldNorthJersey.com. 'We don't have enough test kits, every day more and more people will be getting sick.' The number of virus infections now accounts for 60 percent of the cases in Bergen County as Hameeduddin branded Teaneck 'ground zero'. 'We need everyone to understand that they can infect someone or someone can infect you,' he added, stating that residents should only go outside if they 'absolutely need to'. 'They should stay home,'Hameeduddin said. 'When I say stay home that doesn't mean go out to lunch with your friends across the street. That means no play dates, that means your nuclear family stays with your nuclear family. 'I'm not visiting my sister, I'm not visiting my parents. That is the best way to stop the spread of this.' By Saturday evening, the streets of Teaneck were deserted as the town self-isolated with the hope of defeating the coronavirus cluster that has emerged. Video emerged of the main street in Teaneck close to 6pm Saturday with few people visible and the road empty of cars. 'Teaneck is a ghost town. This is Cedar Lane, Teaneck's busiest street filled with stores, restaurants and a movie theater,' wrote Twitter user Cristian Inga. According to NBC reporter Brian Thompson, the town's business district was already significantly quieter on Saturday afternoon, the sabbath day for its largely Orthodox population, but thevirus has cut across the different populations of the town. Local government has also shut down. Teaneck's action comes just days after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a 'containment area' in the city of New Rochelle, where a cluster of cases was traced to a synagogue. Places where large groups of people would gather were shut down, and residents were asked to self-quarantine. However, healthy residents would still be allowed to come and go, while the National Guard helps delivers meals for those in isolatoin. The number of coronavirus cases in New Jersey is now at 69 after 19 new patients were confirmed since Friday. In one day in Bergen County, the number had also jumped from 25 to 31, the majority of which were in Teaneck. The county has also suffered one fatality. All 75 school districts closed in Bergen County on Friday for a minimum of two weeks but for those children who rely on free or reduced price meals from the districts. Officials are also attempting to establish a mobile testing center on the grounds of the Bergen County Community College campus. A state of emergency was declared in New Jersey last Monday when there were just 11 cases. The second death in the state was confirmed on Saturday night, a woman in her 50s in Monmouth County. 'The State of New Jersey is committed to deploying every available resource, across all levels of government, to help respond to the spread of COVID-19 and keep our residents informed,' said Governor Phil Murphy. 'My administration will continue to work closely with our federal partners to ensure that local health agencies on the front lines of the state's response are equipped with the resources needed to further prepare our health care system for a broader spread of COVID-19.' A press conference is scheduled to be held in Teaneck on Sunday morning to update on the cluster."
24,"Italy's coronavirus death toll leaps by 368 to 1,809 in a day as terrifying video shows how a Lombardy newspaper obituary page has expanded from one to ten pages and secret memo reveals over-80s could be 'left to die'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113675/Italian-town-centre-coronavirus-pandemic-holding-funeral-30-minutes.html,"Coronavirus deaths in Italy rose by 368 overnight to bring the total to 1,809, while 24,747 people have tested positive for the deadly bug. Italian officials confirmed the jump today, as the national lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier this month rumbles on another week. The shocking development comes as chilling footage shows the obituary of one local newspaper expanding from a single page to 10. In the video, a man speaking Italian zooms in on the front page ofL'Eco di Bergamo that circulates in the city in the hard-hit Lombardy region. After showing the date of the paper - February 9 - he turns to the obituaries to reveal a page and a half of death notices published. On that date, Italy had recorded just three confirmed cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. He then holds up an edition of the same newspaper from March 13, when the total number of cases had skyrocketed to 17,600, including 1,266 deaths. Slowly turning the pages and counting, he shows 10 full pages of obituaries, highlighting the horrific impact of the infection. It comes as a secret document prepared by a crisis management unit in Turin suggested that victims will be denied access to intensive care if they are aged over 80 or in poor health as pressures on bed numbers increase. The unit has drawn up a plan that will determine which patients receive treatment in intensive care and which do not if there are insufficient spaces. According to reports by The Telegraph newspaper, the document says coronavirus victims will have access to intensive therapy 'in cases of emergency' if younger than 80 or scoring less than 5 on theCharlson comorbidity Index. That index indicates how many other medical conditions the patient has, and helps to indicate which people are more vulnerable to the virus. Produced by the civil protection department of the Piedmont region, which has been hit hard, intensive care capacity is running short in Italy. One doctor said: '[Who lives and who dies] is decided by age and by the [patient's] health conditions. This is how it is in a war.' The virus has battered Europe, with Italy, the worst-hit European country, seeing the number of deaths climb to 1,441 and infections surging overnight to more than 21,000 because of what authorities characterized as irresponsible behavior by people still socializing despite the nationwide lockdown. The northern region of Lombardy, which includes Milan, is the area worst-hit by the virus.Several cities in the region have been ravaged by the crisis, including picturesque Bergamo, which is just 40 miles from Milan. Bergamo has been hit hard by the virus, with the mortuary at the local hospital full and bodies kept in churches while awaiting burial. A council official claims that funerals are taking place in the country every half an hour.Giacomo Angeloni, in charge of cemeteries in Bergamo, said: 'We are facing an emergency there is no doubting that. We are having a burial every half an hour. 'We had 18 on Saturday, 44 over Sunday and Monday, 33 on Tuesday and 51 on Wednesday. We've had to close Bergamo cemetery for the time being to cope. 'We are using churches as temporary mortuaries. I have to thank my staff for what they are doing in the face of this tragedy. 'Certainly we never imagined having to deal with an emergency on this level.' It comes as Pope Francis praised people for their continuing efforts to help vulnerable communities, including the poor and the homeless, amid the pandemic. Francis for a second Sunday delivered noon remarks and the spoken blessing from inside the Apostolic Library instead of from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square. 'Dear brothers and sisters, in these days St. Peter's Square is closed, so my greeting is aimed directly at you are connected' via TV, online and other means. Francis hailed the archbishop of Milan who last week went atop that city's cathedral to pray before a statue of the Madonna as an example of priests' 'creativity' in keeping spiritually close to their flock. The Pope expressed his own closeness to the sick, to those caring for them or tending to people isolated at home during lockdowns. As he did a week earlier, he later waved from the window and gave a silent blessing with his arm, but this time there were no members of the public in the square, just a few well-wishers standing just beyond the square's boundaries. Spanish authorities meanwhile said the number of infections in the country climbed past 5,700, with half of them in the capital, Madrid.That represents a national increase of over 1,500 in 24 hours. The country had 136 deaths, up from 120. Spain has the fifth-highest number of cases, behind China, Italy, Iran and South Korea.In a nationally televised address Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez detailed the battery of exceptional measures put in place as part of a two-week state of emergency to fight the sharp rise in infections. On Saturday, Spain's Government said Sanchez's wife has tested positive for coronavirus. Begona Gomez and the Prime Minister are in good health. Two ministers of Sanchez's Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. In a lockdown similar to the one already imposed in Italy, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine, commute to work, go to hospitals and banks, or take trips related to the care of the young and the elderly. All schools and universities were closed, along with restaurants, bars, hotels and other non-essential retail businesses. 'From now we enter into a new phase,' Sanchez said after a Cabinet meeting that lasted over seven hours. 'We won't hesitate in doing what we must to beat the virus. 'We are putting health first.' Meanwhile, it was announced that all French ski resorts are closing today and will not reopen for the rest of the season. 'The ski season ends today,' Domaines Skiables de France, which groups the country's resort operators, said on Twitter. 'Holiday-makers and professionals, we're all passionate about skiing and must face up to the seriousness of the situation.' French voters used hand sanitiser and face masks as they headed to the polls to cast their vote during the coronavirus lockdown. They have also been asked to bring their own pens and stand three-feet away from each other as they turn out to vote in local elections. President Emmanuel Macron committed to the vote last night as he placed the country in lockdown and closed all 'non-essential public places'. The list includes cafes, bars, and restaurants. But officials fear that many will stay away despite assurances that the most basic measures will protect even the most vulnerable. France reported a surge in coronavirus cases by 832 last night, bringing its total to 4,499. As many as 91 people have died from the virus. There has also been a rapid increase in serious cases, said head of public health Jerome Salomon, with 150 people below the age of 60 in intensive care."
25,"A prayer for her nation: Defiant Queen, 93, cuts a lonely figure as she arrives solo for church service in Windsor after government advise all people over 70 to self-isolate for 4 MONTHS",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8114031/Queen-arrives-church-Windsor-quitting-Buckingham-Palace-growing-coronavirus-fears.html,"The Queen put on a defiant display as she attended Sunday church service alone in Windsor today. Her Majesty, 93, who opted for a glamorous green ensemble, continued performing her royal duties after Matt Hancock confirmed the government will tell the elderly to stay at home for up to four monthsas he admitted the NHS does not currently have enough ventilators for the fight against coronavirus. The Health Secretary said people over the age of 70 will be told to self-isolate even if they do not have symptoms in a bid to stem the spread of the disease and protect the most vulnerable in society. He commented 'we don't want to do that too soon because clearly it is not an easy thing for people to do, it is not an easy thing for people to sustain' but he said he expected the stay-at-home advice to be issued 'certainly in the coming weeks absolutely'. The move will raise major questions about what the government will do to ensure elderly people are not left without food and medicine. It comes as a palace aide revealed the Queen is staying on at Buckingham Palace despite reports she had quit overcoronavirusfears after Corbra crisis talks. Reports last night claimed Her Majesty had been taken to Windsor Castle with plans in place to quarantine her and Prince Philip, 98, at Sandringham if the outbreak worsens. A royal source told The Sun: 'She is in good health but it was thought best to move her. A lot of her staff are a bit panicky over coronavirus. 'The Queen has met a lot of people there until recently. But she is weeks away from her 94th birthday and advisers believe it is best to get her out of harm's way.' However, a palace insider revealed today that the monarch is expected to stay on at her central London residence. On Friday, Her Majesty's upcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden were postponed because of thecoronaviruspandemic. She is also said to have been advised to cancel her annual garden parties in May and June in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Earlier this month the Queen is reported to have vowed not to let the outbreak stop her from performing her duties and to set an example by 'keeping calm and carrying on' until there is 'compelling advice to the contrary'. It was revealed that abuilding in Windsor Great Park was closed for a deep clean after three people showed symptoms similar to those of Covid-19.The Savill Building is closed over the weekend for the clean to take place. A statement on the park's website said: 'As a precautionary measure we have taken the decision to close The Savill Building over the weekend to conduct a deep clean of the premises, after becoming aware of three individuals, who are showing symptoms similar to those of Covid-19, having been on site. 'Whilst these are not confirmed cases we feel that this is a prudent step that prioritises the health and wellbeing of our employees and visitors. 'We continue to monitor the situation and Government's public health guidance closely. The rest of Windsor Great Park remains open as usual.' ThePrince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall had already pulled out of their spring overseas tour just days before it was due to begin, raising the prospect that more royal engagements could face cancellation in the coming weeks. The Queen was due to visit the Bentley Motors Factory in Crewe, and the Jodrell Bank Observatory and Square Kilometre Array Global Headquarters in Macclesfield on March 19.She was also due to visit Camden on March 26, but full details of the trip had not yet been released. Charles and Camilla had been due to start their spring tour to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus and Jordan on March 17. Itwould have marked the first time a royal has visited Cyprus since the Queen in 1993. A spokesman for the Queen said: 'As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, changes are being made to The Queen's diary commitments in the coming weeks. 'In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, Her Majesty's forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden will be rescheduled. 'Audiences will continue as usual. Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice.' The Queen - the nation's longest reigning monarch - is due to turn 94 next month and the risk of more severe symptoms from the Covid-19 illness is greater for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. The day of engagements next Thursday would have seen the monarch travel to Cheshire to meet staff and apprentices at the Bentley factory, operate the Lovell Telescope at the observatory and meet local school children engaging in hands on science activities. The Queen wore large gloves when she handed out honours to recipients at a palace investiture on March 3. She also avoided shaking hands at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey and during a one-to-one audience with the Sri Lankan High Commissioner this week, but was back shaking hands with Professor Mark Compton, Lord Prior of the Order of St John, on Wednesday. It comes asThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall yesterday revealed they would postpone their spring tour of the coronavirus pandemic. The overall week-long visit had been due to start on March 17 and would have marked the first time a royal has visited Cyprus since the Queen in 1993. Clarence House said the request came from the Government. Heir to the throne Charles and Camilla are understood to be in good health. The tour may be replaced with engagements in the UK, but not those involving significant gatherings of people. Charles was set to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina on March 17 and 18, be joined by Camilla in Cyprus from March 18 to 21, and head to Jordan together until March 25. 'Owing to the unfolding situation with the coronavirus pandemic the British government has asked their royal highnesses to postpone their Spring tour,' a spokesman for the royal couple said yesterday. While inJordan, the pair would have met meet King Abdallah II and Queen Rania of Jordan and taken in a number of other sites of cultural, religious and environmental significance across the country. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Charles would have seen the memorial at Srebrenica to mark the 25th anniversary of the genocide. Cyprus, which has a population of 1.17 million, announced four more COVID19 cases yesterday taking the total to 14. In Bosniaand Herzegovina there are thought to be 11 confirmed cases. Announcing news of their tour in February, they wrote: 'The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall will jointly visit the Republic of Cyprus and Jordan next month. 'Prior to this, The Prince will also visit Bosnia and Herzegovina.In the year of the 25th anniversary of the genocide, The Prince will visit Bosnia and Herzegovina where he will highlight reforms to improve citizens' lives. 'The Prince and The Duchess will make their first official visit to The Republic of Cyprus to recognise the work of the UN Peacekeeping Force and celebrate traditional Cypriot culture. 'Their Royal Highnesses will visit The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to learn what the country is doing to support refugees and showcase its rich cultural history.' Charles was due to start the tour by visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina todemonstrate the UK's increased commitment to BiH and the Western Balkans region, its support for reforms to improve citizens' lives. The Prince of Wales was then to be joined by the Duchess of Cornwall on March 18, as theyvisit to The Republic of Cyprus to celebrate the historic ties between the United Kingdom and Cyprus. The last leg of the tour was set to see Charles and Camilla return to Jordan from March 21 to March 25, to highlight their close ties with Jordan, underpinned by the long-standing, warm relationship between the two Royal Families. The couple would see how the country supports its one million refugees fleeing conflict, and meet members of the Jordanian Royal Family. The news comes after Charles shared a Namaste bow with Baroness Floella Benjamin yesterday amid the coronavirus pandemic, as she collected her damehood at Buckingham Palace. The pair were spotted exchanging the greeting, which avoids any unnecessary touching of hands, during the investiture ceremony. Known to millions as the host of Play School and Play Away, Baroness Benjamin, a beloved children's TV presenter, was recognised for her services to charity in the New Year Honours List. The Liberal Democrat life peer has dedicated over 40 years to campaigning for young people and supports charities including Barnardo's, Sickle Cell Society and Beating Bowel Cancer. After receiving her damehood, the 70-year-old, from London, said: 'You get such a buzz from giving back and making a difference, changing the world, and to get an honour like this after these years it's like wonderful recognition. 'Today, it's giving me a wonderful feeling in my heart. I haven't done charity work for any ulterior motive but only to change people's lives. 'To get it, it is like wow, how exciting. But I'm still thinking: what more can I do? To me, it doesn't end here.' A 'huge admirer' of Prince Charles, Baroness Benjamin said she was 'thrilled' to receive her damehood from him yesterday. Charles is not the first royal to take precautions, with the Duchess of Cornwall wearing a pair of leather gloves to shake hands with people she met at Cheltenham this week. But the Queen's granddaughter Zara Philips didn't seem to have let the threat of the outbreak faze her, as she dished out hugs at the racecourse."

27,Pope Francis walks through Rome's deserted streets and delivers blessing above an empty square as Italians remain indoors amid coronavirus lockdown,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114643/Pope-Francis-walks-Romes-deserted-streets-amid-coronavirus-lockdown.html,"Pope Francis defied Italian government advice to stay indoors and today walked to church through Rome's deserted streets to pray for the end of coronavirus. The Catholic leader had earlier delivered a blessing from his balcony window above an eerily empty St Peter's Square, which has been closed to worshippers as part of the country's sweeping lockdown. Francis then left the Vatican to visit two churches in the Italian capital, first praying in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore before strolling down the usually bustling Via del Corso. He headed to the St Marcello al Corso,which poignantly hosts a crucifix carried in a 1522 procession in Rome when the city was stricken with plague. Flanked by his security detail, the 83-year-old pope, who has been nursing a cold, decided to walk through the streets 'as if on a pilgrimage,' Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said. His walkabout came just hours after it was announced that the Vatican's Holy Week ceremonies will go ahead behind closed doors so not to accelerate Italy's sky-high infection rate which soared to 24,747 today. The country is battling the second largest outbreak outside of mainland China, and is mourning the deaths of 1,809 virus victims. Everyday life has been tipped upside-down for millions of Italians - schools have been shut, towns have been sealed off, sports games canned and mass gatherings banned. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that 'as far as Holy Week liturgical celebrations are concerned, I can specify that all are confirmed.' But Bruni added: 'As things stand, under study are the ways they would be carried out and who would participate while respecting the security measures put in place to avoid spread of the coronavirus.' He added that faithful will be able to follow the ceremonies on TV, radio and through online media. Streaming sermons has already been implemented, and before delivering his blessing from the balcony today, Francis was filmed doing prayers safe inside the Vatican's private library. Vatican media added that 'until April 12 the General Audiences and the Angelus presided over by the Holy Father will be available only in live streaming on the official Vatican News website.' April 12 is Easter Sunday, when normally tens of thousands of faithful would fill St Peter's Square for an outdoor papal Mass, listen to the pope's speech and receive his blessing, delivered from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica. Although Easter itself was not specified in the Vatican statements, it appeared likely restrictions on large gatherings might well continue in Italy. The Italian government has said it would decide whether measures, now in effect through April 3, would need extending or tightening. Holy Week begins with Palm Sunday on April 5, with tradition calling for an outdoor Mass in the square also on that day, when faithful clutch palm fronds and olive branches. Italy, the center of Europe's conoravirus outbreak is under severe lockdown, with the public restricted from leaving their homes except to buy food, go to work or a few other urgent reasons, and must stay at least one meter (about three feet) away from each other. The disease for most people causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, like the elderly and the fragile, it can cause more severe illness. At 83 with one lung partially compromised, Francis is among the most vulnerable to the infection's potentially deadly affects. The Vatican says he has had a cold in recent weeks. Italy's virus cases surged again Sunday, with 3,590 more cases in a 24-hour period for a total of 24,747. Chilling footage shows the obituary of one local newspaper expanding from a single page to 10. In the video, a man speaking Italian zooms in on the front page of L'Eco di Bergamo that circulates in the city in the hard-hit Lombardy region. After showing the date of the paper - February 9 - he turns to the obituaries to reveal a page and a half of death notices published. On that date, Italy had recorded just three confirmed cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. He then holds up an edition of the same newspaper from March 13, when the total number of cases had skyrocketed to 17,600, including 1,266 deaths. Slowly turning the pages and counting, he shows 10 full pages of obituaries, highlighting the horrific impact of the infection. Deaths also jumped, with 368 additional patients, bringing the overall death toll to 1,809. The additional infections reported Sunday represented the biggest day-to-day increase so far in Italy. With St Peter's Square closed to the public, and one case of infection reported by the Vatican recently, Francis on Sunday delivered his traditional weekly commentary and blessing from the Apostolic Library instead of from a window overlooking the vast square. Francis praised priests for 'creativity' in tending to their flocks, especially in the region of Lombardy, northern Italy, where thousands have been hospitalized or are in quarantine. He said their efforts demonstrated there are 'a thousand ways to be near' to the faithful, if not physically. Some churches in Italy are being allowed to stay open for individual prayer, but all public Masses are forbidden during Italy's lockdown to discourage crowding. As infections in Italy continue to balloon, Milan's Lombardy region governor Attilio Fontana said the situation in areas around the country's financial hub was only 'getting worse'. 'We are close to the point where we will no longer be able to resuscitate people because we will be out of intensive care unit beds,' Fontana told Italy's Sky TG24 channel. 'We need those machines (doctors) use to ventilate lungs, artificial respirators that unfortunately we cannot find,' Fontana said. The Lombardy region has recorded 1,218 of the Italian deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 over the past three weeks - more than the rest of Europe combined. The region of 10 million - slightly smaller but more economically productive than neighbouring Switzerland to the north - also has 13,272 reported infections and 767 people in intensive care. Milan mayor Beppe Sala said he had managed to secure shipments of surgical masks from China to help cover a growing shortage. 'Milan has always had excellent relations with the main Chinese cities and I made a few phone calls over the past few days in search of masks,' the Milan mayor said. 'The first shipment arrived (Friday) and we will now distribute them to doctors, to our staff.' By Amelia Wynne for MailOnline The Italian airforce played Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma as they put on an incredible air display to lift the spirits of their nation during the coronavirus lockdown. In a performance which the airforce reportedly does on a regular basis, a set of jet fighters used coloured smoke to paint the Italian flag while the emotional song played. The clip was shared by theAeronautica Militare who said: 'Unity and teamwork have always been the principles on which our Armed Force is based and, at this moment more than ever, are fundamental.' Footage of the event has gone viral on social media, with even Donald Trump sharing the video, declaring 'the United States love Italy.' Many online praised the use of the song which has lyrics such as 'watch the stars that tremble with love and with hope'- saying it was fitting for the current circumstances. Coronavirus deaths in Italy rose by 368 overnight to bring the total to 1,809, while 24,747 people have tested positive for the deadly bug. Italian officials confirmed the jump today, as the national lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier this month rumbles on another week. The shocking development comes as chilling footage shows the obituary of one local newspaper expanding from a single page to 10. It comes as thousands of Italians in Rome, Milan, and Naples applauded healthcare workers from their balconies and windows yesterday as they raised spirits with a flashmob during the draconian coronavirus lockdown. Families and neighbours also sang and crashed pots and pans together for the performers in cities across the country, organised through messaging service WhatsApp for noon yesterday. Rejoicing spectators exclaimed patriotic and uplifting phrases including 'Viva l'Italia' (Long live Italy) and 'Vinceremo' (we will win). The few cars on the street joined the chorus by blaring their horns. Many also waved banners decorated with rainbows and the phrase 'Andra tutto benne' (everything will go well). The heartwarming sight follows Friday's flashmob, where Italians sang in chorus for a rousing rendition of the national anthemFratelli d'Italia. Currently 60million people are in lockdown in the Mediterranean country. 'I received a circulating message, forwarded to me by a friend... which is basically encouraging Italians to participate in a kind of flashmob on Friday 13 at 6pm,' said Rome resident Yemi Adeyeye. 'My street came alive at that time. It was a euphoric moment.' Jessica Phelan, 34, who has lived in Rome for two years, said neighbours were waving and saying ciao to each other, and called out 'a domani' (see you tomorrow) afterwards. 'I think it shows that people will continue to seek community,' she said, 'even if they can't socialise. 'It's a way to say we're all in it together'.  "
28,"The UK advises against all but essential travel to the US after coronavirus cases soar to 2,951 and 60 deaths and Trump announces ban for British visitors",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113991/Foreign-Offices-advises-against-essential-travel-coronavirus-cases-soar.html,"UNITED STATES CITIZENS American nationals will be able to return to the US, but will be funnelled to 13 designated airports where they will be screened for COVID-19. LEGAL RESIDENTS Those with green cards or other visa guarantees are allowed to return, and will also undergo testing. EVERYONE ELSE Everyone travelling from Britain who does not hold US citizenship or residency will be banned from entering American soil from midnight, US eastern time, on Monday. The UK Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to the US after cases in the country soared to 2,952 and 60 deaths, and Donald Trump announced a travel ban for UK visitors. A spokesman said: 'We are advising against all but essential travel to the USA following the US government announcement imposing restrictions on travel from the UK (and Ireland) effective from midnight on Monday 16 March EST or 4am on Tuesday 17 March GMT.' They said that British nationals with upcoming journeys planned or those already in the US should check with their airlines and tour operators. Around 3.8million British citizens visit the US every year. Donald Trump extended the United States' coronavirus travel ban to people from the UK and Ireland yesterday, scuppering work and holiday plans for many Britons. The President had initially excluded the UK and Ireland from the European ban of 26 countries, but added it to the blacklist yesterday afternoon as infection rates soared overnight. Under the restrictions, American citizens and green card holders are still allowed to return home, but will be funnelled to 13 airports and subjected to health screenings and quarantine orders.Some airlines are already operating reduced services due to a drop in demand. Flanked by his advisers at a White House press briefing, Mr Trump, who confirmed he had been tested for COVID-19, said yesterday: 'We're looking at it very seriously, yes, because they've had a little bit of activity unfortunately, so we're going to be looking at that. 'We actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced.' Shortly after, US Vice President Mike Pence confirmed the ban, saying: 'In our taskforce meeting today the President has made a decision to suspend all travel to the UK and Ireland, effective midnight Monday night, eastern standard time.' The UK Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to 30 countries including China, Italy, Spain and Sri Lanka. It also advised against going on cruise ships for all nationals aged 70 and over. He said on Thursday he was considering other major restrictions, such as limiting travel to domestic hot spots like California and Washington state, without spelling out how he would manage such an extraordinary effort. The State Department issued a global advisory cautioning citizens to 'reconsider travel abroad', while passengers in Britain frantically queued to get back to the US before the anticipated changes. Mr Trump initially announced a ban on all travellers coming from Europe's Schengen Zone but had excluded Britain because he believed the UK authorities were doing a 'good job'. But he rowed back on Friday and said Britain's 'numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours', causing him to rethink his strategy of fighting the deadly virus. The travel ban is a crushing blow for British Airways which was already struggling to stay afloat amid a plummet in demand because of the coronavirus pandemic. Immediately after the President's announcement, BA's social media was bombarded by customers asking about refunds for booked flights. Hundreds of families and individual travellers were seen waiting in long lines at Heathrow's Terminal 5 this morning to check in alongside their luggage for British Airways flights to the US. But some of those queuing were likely to be disappointed as data from website Flightaware showed 41 flights leaving Heathrow are cancelled today, with another six delayed. A further 35 flights due to come into the airport have also been cancelled, with six delayed. And despite official advice that masks will not guard against getting the infection, some of those at Heathrow were seen wearing them as they waited to board flights. Trump's 30-day travel ban for Europe, which currently applies to citizens of 26 countries, took effect from 12am, causing many Americans in Europe to scramble to buy last-minute plane tickets. One family of three paid nearly $8,000 for three one-way tickets from Paris to New York. On Friday night, Delta Air Lines announced it is suspending all flights to Europe andwill cut passenger-carrying capacity by 40 per cent to deal with a nosedive in travel demand. The cut in capacity over the next few months is the largest in Delta's history, surpassing reductions that were made after the September 2001 terror attacks. Delta also said it will stop all flights to continental Europe for the next 30 days - possibly longer - ground up to 300 airplanes, delay deliveries of new planes to save cash, and cut spending by $2billion. And British Airways said it was fighting for survival amid the global disaster and revealed it will have to lay off staff and ground planes on a scale bigger than anything caused by 9/11 or the financial crisis in 2008. Trump earlier declared a state of national emergency, allowing him to access $50billion in emergency funds and unveiling drive-thru testing at major retailers including Walmart, Target and CVS. But he said testing should not be available to everyone, directing people instead to a Google-run website to tell people what to do. When it will launch will be announced on Sunday. In the UK on Friday,millions of British workers stayed at home as commuters found car parks empty, train carriages deserted and seats available on the busiest routes because of thecoronaviruscrisis. Mainline railways stations in the UK's towns and cities were largely empty as were Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted airports while major shopping streets in London usually teeming with people also eerily quiet. Transport for London, who had a Jubilee Line train driver test positive for coronavirus yesterday, said thaton buses and the Tube, used by 5million each day, journeys are down two per cent in a week. As many as 20million of the country's 33million working population could soon be working from home, according to an office survey by IWG Global Workplace. Social media users reported quieter than usual trains travelling to cities including London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Sheffield, Newcastle, Birmingham and Cambridge. One Twitter user said: 'It's so quiet for the rush hour train to Newcastle ... everyone in scarves or masks and you can tell the sheer fear has hit.' Another wrote: 'Eerily quiet on the trains this morning but business as usual on the ward. Has the feel of those weird days between Christmas and New Year.' It came as Boris Johnson ramped up Number 10's response to second phase of the Government's coronavirus action plan but ministers refused to shut schools and delayed any rules banning large gatherings or international travel, but he said this may change in the near future. Officials have controversially said they are instead aiming for a policy which could see up to 40million people left to catch the virus in the hope that the country will build up a herd immunity as they recover, meaning so many people will be immune to the virus that it won't be able to spread when it inevitably reappears in the future. Meanwhile in the US, Trump ignored his own medical guidelines by saying he would get a test himself, not because he fears he is infected, but 'because I think I will do it anyway'. He also failed to address when adequate numbers of tests will finally arrive - and one of his advisers said the president only 'realised' there was a problem on Tuesday. Boris Johnson stopped short of more dramatic measures like a travel ban, or shutdowns of schools and public gatherings which have beenannounced in Ireland, France and Spain and other countries. The move has triggered a political row and former Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and London mayor candidate Rory Stewart, said the Government needs to do more now. Britain's FTSE 100 economic index had a see-saw day on Friday after a turbulent week, rising and then falling before a quick rebound saw it nudge up 1.7 per cent before it closed at5,324 points. Stocks and markets around the world have been battered by fears of how the coronavirus will hit the economy as millions are off work. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 5,300 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 140,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 â€“ possibly 9,700 â€“ were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 â€“ doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests â€“ caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
29,"Spanish police use megaphones to tell people to stay indoors or face $30,000 fines as coronavirus deaths DOUBLE to 288 overnight",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114189/Spanish-police-use-megaphones-tell-people-stay-indoors-face-25-000-fines.html,"Spanish police stepped up their operation to force people to stay indoors today, with officers driving up and down beaches with megaphones, warning of prison time and massive Â£25,000 fines for those breaking the lockdown - after the country's deathsfrom the coronavirus doubled to 288 overnight. Footage shared on Twitter captures officers as they tell residents and tourists to 'stay safely at your accommodation or home and follow instructions from local authorities'. It comes as British holidaymakers scramble to escape the country after it was placed on lockdown this weekend -with Spanishdeaths from the coronavirus more than doubling in24 hours, health authorities have announced. Total infections in Spain have approached 8,000 and the Health Ministry said the nation has recorded 288 deaths since the start of the pandemic, up from 136 on Saturday. The jump comes a day after Spain's government declared a state of emergency and took extraordinary measures to limit movement to commuting to work and necessary errands. It has also closed restaurants, bars, most retail shops and reduced public transport. Crowds of tourists were captured queuing at a Barcelona bus station for services towards the airport today, as the 15-day state of emergency continued. Meanwhile, police helicopters and drones were also used to encourage locals and tourists to stay in their homes and hotels to stem the spread of coronavirus. Spaniards may leave home to go to work, 'buy bread', go to the pharmacy and get medical care but 'not to go have dinner at a friend's house', said the Prime Minister, whose wife has now tested positive for the virus. In Barcelona, people who ventured out on quiet streets to buy bread at one bakery formed long lines with a meter in between each person as recommended by authorities to reduce the risk of contagion. Police patrolled parks and told people who weren't taking their dog on a quick walk to go home. A plane on its way from the UK to Spain was even forced to turn back mid-air as chaos took hold on the continent. Ryanair said it has been â€˜forced to severely reduceâ€™ flights to and from Spain, the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from midnight on Sunday to midnight on Thursday in response to the decision of the Spanish government to lock down the country. On Saturday, airline Jet2 cancelled all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands and TUI customers were informed that holidays booked to the country between yesterday and tomorrow have been cancelled. Jet2 has also stopped all flights to Lyon, Grenoble, Paris and Nice due to travel restrictions implemented by the French government. However, they pledged to continue with some scheduled flights to allow customers to fly back to the UK. This includes its programme of flights onSaturday 21 March to theUK from Lyon and Grenoble, and its flights to Britain from Paris onSunday 15 and 16 March, as well as ones fromNice on Monday. The cancellations prompted fears that British holidaymakers will not be able to leave the countries as they are locked down. Maureen Green, 57, from Lancashire, who owns a holiday home in Torrevieja, on the Costa Blanca, told the Telegraph that she fears she won't be able to get back to the UK to see her 84-year-old mother. She said: 'I believe the army are now joining forces with the police to make sure people stay indoors except for absolutely necessary visits to the supermarket, work or for medical care. My biggest nightmare at this time is that the airports will close and Iâ€™ll be trapped here.' Sarah Cowie, 20, from Aberdeenshire, anErasmus student who has been living in Granada since September, told the publication that available flights had been filling up extremely quickly. She said: 'All the flights are getting booked up ... and there are so many students trying to leave.' Many Erasmus students on their years abroad are looking for the first available flights back to the UK to return to their families, while tourists have been left in the lurch. The returning flights have been booking up quickly as Brits look to escape before the shutdown kicks in. The Foreign Office has advised against non-essential travel to Spain and said anyone planning to travel to Spain should consult their airline or tour operator. Earlier, police in Benidorm had run-ins with Brits as they tried to disperse large groups who had spent much of the day drinking take-away alcohol on the streets. Spain's government also revealed last week that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has tested positive for coronavirus. Countries across Europe were placed into lockdown yesterday in a desperate attempt to stem the soaring tally of cases after the Continent became the new 'epicentre' of the global pandemic. France last night took the decision to close all non-essential public locations. Restaurants, shops, cinemas and cafes have shut for the foreseeable future as French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe branded the virus the 'biggest health crisis in a century'. Meanwhile, Poland shut down all its airports - forcing thousands of stranded British tourists to head out of the country by car. Borders were also closed to foreign visitors in Denmark, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Russia and Ukraine. In Spain, police patrolled popular beach resorts such as Benidorm and the Costa del Sol urging people to stay inside. There were 3,000 new diagnoses in the capital, Madrid, and health authorities stopped testing those with only mild symptoms in the city. Spain's government says that the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has tested positive for coronavirus. The government said Begona Gomez and the prime minister are in good health. Two ministers from Mr Sanchez's Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative. The state of emergency means millions of Spanish people - and 300,000 British expats - will be allowed to venture outside only to commute to work, buy food and medicine, or to go to hospital. Eva Marie, from Leicester, who is studying in Madrid, said she was 'spending the day watching Netflix in my apartment, following the news and packing my case in hopes my flight to the UK tomorrow will still go ahead'. Police in Benidorm had run-ins with British holidaymakers who had spent much of the day drinking on the streets after bars and clubs were shut. Officers armed with batons had to break up one group at around 3pm on Saturday afternoon. Reinforcement arrived as two local police officers struggled to get them to vacate the area. One could be seen using force to push several people away as a colleague dealt with others who appeared to be resisting attempts to move them on. Police sirens sounded in the background. A couple of hours later police had to deal with another large group of Brits who were drinking out of one-litre lager bottles and cans near the same spot outside the Trebol Apartments in Benidorm's Levante Beach area. One Brit could be overheard telling a police officer: 'We're not causing any trouble, we're just walking away.' This is the second European nation to put extreme measures in place after Italy - the worst affected country outside China - was quarantined this week. MailOnline is awaiting clarification from the Foreign Office on what the new measures will mean for British nationals already in the country, although it is unlikely Britons will be prevented from leaving,as was the case when Italy was quarantined last week. Spain's borders remain open for the time being, although this could change as the new restrictive measures come into effect on Monday. The FCO has advised against all but essential travel to affected regions in Spain. Meanwhile British airline Jet2 made the decision to cancel all of its flights to Spain and apparently turned back flights in midair. The company said it decided to cancel the flights as Spanish authorities moved to introduce tighter restrictions. 'We know these local measures will have a significant impact on our customers' holidays which is why we have taken this decision.' Air traffic monitor Flightradar 24 said at least seven Jet2 flights with a destination in Spain turned around and came back to the U.K on Saturday.TUI has also suspended all holidaus to the country. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is said to be preparing to shut down the country's airspace as part of far-reaching power granted by theState of Alarm issued, according to local media reports. The exceptional measures enable the government to restrict peoples' movement and could give them the power to limit flights into and out of the country. It comes as tourists in the Spanish Costas were warned not to 'act as if you're on holiday' as the country remains gripped by the deadly bug. Politicians in some of Spain's top resorts are demanding new arrivals show responsibility to slow the spread of coronavirus. Beaches are being closed along the Costa Blanca which covers resorts such as Benidorm and the Costa del Sol. Local police drove around the Costa Blanca resort of Torrevieja on Friday asking people who had arrived from elsewhere to 'stay indoors.' Town hall officials in nearby Pilar de la Horadada - home to thousands of British expats and a popular holiday destination 40 miles south of Alicante - said: 'If you have come to Pilar de la Horadada to enjoy its beaches, magnificent food and fabulous open spaces, we ask you to stay inside until the coronavirus crisis has passed.' A Jet2 spokesperson said: 'In response to local measures introduced throughout Spain to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of bars, restaurants, shops and activities including any water sports, we have taken the decision to cancel all flights to Mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands with immediate effect. 'We know these local measures will have a significant impact on our customers' holidays, which is why we have taken this decision. 'We are contacting our customers who are currently in these destinations, and who are due to travel, to advise them of their options, so we urge customers not to call us. 'This is a fast-moving and complex situation and we are reviewing our programme as a matter of urgency, so that we can fly customers back to the UK. 'The health and safety of our customers is our number one priority, and we would like to thank our customers for their understanding.' Tourists in Fuengirola woke up to find the red flag had been hoisted over the resort's main beach. The council said in a statement: 'Due to the imminent announcement of the State of Alarm, Fuengirola Town Hall has decided to close its beaches to the public from today. 'We ask people to respect this restriction, which will be signalled with a red flag along the city's coastline. Sorry for any inconvenience.' The State of Alarm enables police to restrict peoples' movement nationwide and could lead to the closure of ports, airports and the train network. Britons in Benidorm laughed off government-imposed bar curfew in Spain byguzzling down beer by the beach and stocking up trolleys with alcohol last night. One smiling tourist risked the wrath of expats and locals by holding up a pack of Corona lager as his shirtless pals downed drinks beside him. Their show of defiance followed pleas by Spanish politicians to stay indoors yesterday ahead of a national ban due to come into force allowing people to leave their homes or hotels only under certain 'emergency' conditions. Police in Benidorm have yet to make any official announcement on how they will deal with British tourists who insist on continuing to make supermarket booze runs and filling up trolleys with alcohol only. But they are expected to try and put a stop to the practice on the basis the products are not essential items under the terms of the State of Alarm Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez said yesterday he would bring into force. Karen Maling Cowles, president of the Benidorm British Business Association, said she was 'saddened' and 'sickened' by the scenes. The expat, who had decided to self-isolate ahead of the government home confinement order and posted photos of exhausted frontline Spanish nurses on social media, said: 'We are in a crisis and people need to take this seriously. 'Sadly it's those who aren't taking this seriously who will prolong this problem. 'While everybody's out they could be infecting each other. 'It's the minority of people who are in holiday mode who are forgetting what's around on around them and it's really sad. 'I just can't understand why they are acting the way they are. 'They have to realise this can't be a holiday for them because this is a health emergency.' The scenes of British holidaymakers packing the seafront in Benidorm, despite red flags banning bathing, led to calls from angry expats and locals for them to be sent back home on the first planes available. One said: 'I hope that all the British who are currently partying in Benidorm don't get any type of health assistance when they fall ill in our country.' Another added: 'I hope the first measure implemented as part of the State of Alarm is the immediate expulsion of these Brits.' Miriam Gonzalez tweeted: 'Tell the Brits in Benidorm the Spanish are staying indoors. 'They are being irresponsible by carrying on as if nothing was happening, they give British people a bad name.' Benidorm-based doctor Maria Diaz Gomez posted footage of tourists downing lager in packed bars in the resort's Little England area ahead of last night's (FRI) midnight lockdown banning them from opening for two weeks. She said: 'We are on call in Benidorm. Live. Thousand of foreigners ignoring measures to contain the pandemic. How slowly the clock advances towards midnight.' She added: 'In a society of 'Me' and 'Now', it's all we can expect.' Benidorm tourism portal Turismo de Benidorm said in a tweet alongside a Union Jack flag: 'At these hard times the VisitBenidorm team stands by your side. 'Stay calm, stay home, stay safe and let our Instagram, Facebook and Twitter entertain you. We love you all dearly.' The refusal of many people to heed officials' recommendations to stay at home and stop the spread of coronavirus, sparked the anger of many full-time Costa residents. Much of it was directed at people from Madrid and the Basque Country who have second homes in areas like the Costa Blanca and Costa del Sol and decamped to the coast to escape the coronavirus crisis which hit worse there earlier. Former Spanish PM Jose Maria Aznar and his wife Ana Botella, who have left the Spanish capital for their mansion near Marbella, have come in for criticism on social media. One angry Spaniard branded them 'bad citizens' and 'toxic.' And ANC England, a UK-based pro Catalan-independence movement, used the coronavirus to make its own political attack by claiming: 'Spain is a failed state which has allowed mass spreading of coronavirus with thousands leaving Madrid including former PM Aznar quitting to his Marbella mansion, triggering confinements and barricades across Spain. But British holidaymakers also came in for criticism over the way they have reacted to the crisis. Benidorm-based doctor Maria Diaz Gomez posted footage of tourists downing lager in packed bars in the resort's Little England area ahead of last night's midnight lockdown banning them from opening for two weeks. She said: 'We are on call in Benidorm. Live. Thousand of foreigners ignoring measures to contain the pandemic. How slowly the clock advances towards midnight.' She added: 'In a society of 'Me' and 'Now', it's all we can expect.' Another angry Spaniard, raging against the Brits packing out Gerona Street in the heart of the Little England area, added: 'Benidorm. Ground zero. Gerona Street. Full of d***heads.' But another replied: 'There are thousands of foreigners because many Spaniards opened their bars. 'I'm all for responsibility, but from everyone.' There were no immediate reports of any violent incidents or arrests last night linked to the forced closure of bars in places like Benidorm, or in resorts in Majorca and Ibiza. There, nightclubs were told to shut and the larger bars and restaurants ordered to limit the number of people they let in. Police were out in force in the Little England area to ensure nightspots obeyed the lockdown order. Bolton-born expat Lyndsey Leech said: 'Everyone's complaining about the English who wanted to stay outside and drink, but they forget that it's the fault of people from Madrid that we're all indoors now.' Peter Wharton, who is due to fly to Benidorm later today, said: 'We are due to fly with Jet2 to Benidorm this afternoon. 'The resort is in lockdown, bars are closed and our hotel advise against travel. 'Yet Jet2 continue to fly people because the Foreign Office have not advised against travel.' And John Williams raged at Ryanair: 'Benidorm have closed all bars and restaurants, yet you have not cancelled your flights to Alicante. 'The Spanish see fit to shut the place because of the risk yet you're quite happy to take our money and continue to fly there. 'Do the right thing.' The Balearic Islands president Francina Armengol has asked Pedro Sanchez to restrict as much as possible the numbers of flights to and from the holiday destination. Spanish authorities yesterday implemented a curfew across Catalonia. Mr Sanchez's leftwing government took few steps at first to impose tough measures and changed tack only this week as numbers soared. The opposition has criticised the government for letting events like International Women's Day marches go ahead a week ago. Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative opposition People's Party said on Friday said: 'In the past few weeks, serious negligence has been committed by the government, such as encouraging a massive demonstration with hundreds of thousands of people last Sunday.' National and regional authorities have said they reacted appropriately, taking stronger measures when the number of cases started soaring on Monday. With schools now shut across the country and a first package of economic measures announced on Thursday, the government met - via videoconference - on Saturday to prepare a new package of economic and social measures. In an increasingly deserted capital city, where all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies shut down, posters put up by the city authorities read: 'The best option to prevent the propagation of the virus is to stay at home.' On public radio, official messages told people to wash their hands, use disposable tissues and avoid all but essential travel.  "
30,Italian airforce plays Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma as they put on incredible air display to lift the spirits of their nation during coronavirus lockdownÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114549/Italian-airforce-plays-Pavarotti-singing-Nessun-Dorma-incredible-air-display.html,"The Italian airforce played Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma as they put on an incredible air display to lift the spirits of their nation during the coronavirus lockdown. In a performance which the airforce reportedly does on a regular basis, a set of jet fighters used coloured smoke to paint the Italian flag while the emotional song played. The clip was shared by theAeronautica Militare who said: 'Unity and teamwork have always been the principles on which our Armed Force is based and, at this moment more than ever, are fundamental.' Footage of the event has gone viral on social media, with even Donald Trump sharing the video, declaring 'the United States love Italy.' Many online praised the use of the song which has lyrics such as 'watch the stars that tremble with love and with hope'- saying it was fitting for the current circumstances. Coronavirus deaths in Italy rose by 368 overnight to bring the total to 1,809, while 24,747 people have tested positive for the deadly bug. Italian officials confirmed the jump today, as the national lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier this month rumbles on another week. The shocking development comes as chilling footage shows the obituary of one local newspaper expanding from a single page to 10. It comes as thousands of Italians in Rome, Milan, and Naples applauded healthcare workers from their balconies and windows yesterday as they raised spirits with a flashmob during the draconian coronavirus lockdown. Families and neighbours also sang and crashed pots and pans together for the performers in cities across the country, organised through messaging service WhatsApp for noon yesterday. Rejoicing spectators exclaimed patriotic and uplifting phrases including 'Viva l'Italia' (Long live Italy) and 'Vinceremo' (we will win). The few cars on the street joined the chorus by blaring their horns. Many also waved banners decorated with rainbows and the phrase 'Andra tutto benne' (everything will go well). The heartwarming sight follows Friday's flashmob, where Italians sang in chorus for a rousing rendition of the national anthemFratelli d'Italia. Currently 60million people are in lockdown in the Mediterranean country. 'I received a circulating message, forwarded to me by a friend... which is basically encouraging Italians to participate in a kind of flashmob on Friday 13 at 6pm,' said Rome resident Yemi Adeyeye. 'My street came alive at that time. It was a euphoric moment.' Jessica Phelan, 34, who has lived in Rome for two years, said neighbours were waving and saying ciao to each other, and called out 'a domani' (see you tomorrow) afterwards. 'I think it shows that people will continue to seek community,' she said, 'even if they can't socialise. 'It's a way to say we're all in it together'."
31,Coronavirus decimates Hollywood: US box office plunges to a 20 YEAR low amid the pandemic with $56M weekend sales worse than 9/11Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114495/Box-office-plunges-20-year-low-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-Canada-sales-56million.html,"Ticket sales plunged to their lowest levels in at least 20 years at North American movie theaters as the coronavirus pandemic led to one of Hollywood's worst weekends at the box office. The continent's two largest chains, AMC Theaters and Regal Cinemas, said they wouldn't fill theaters to more than 50 percent capacity to facilitate social distancing and others includingAlamo Drafthouse and Arclight asked moviegoers to leave empty seats around them. As COVID-19 cases reached over 3,000 Sunday, studio estimates said receipts totaled about $56million in U.S. and Canada theaters and the impact was believed to be due to audiences staying home and theaters capping seating capacity. Disney's latest release from Pixar, Onward, remained the top film, earning $10.5million in its second weekend (Friday to Sunday). The Christian romance I Still Believe from Lionsgate brought in $9.5million from 3,250 theaters. It has an ""A"" CinemaScore and is performing strongest in the south and midwest. Sony's comic-book adaptation Bloodshot, with Vin Diesel, grossed an estimated $9.3million from 2,861 venues. Rated ""B"" with the audience on CinemaScore, it placed number 3 on the box office. The Hunt, an R-rated political satire from Universal, came in fifth place with $5.3million from 3,028 locations, about half of what was expected heading into the weekend. It has a ""C+"" CinemaScore and a 54% average on Rotten Tomatoes. The movies, starring Hilary Swank, came in behind fellow studio release, The Invisible Man, now in its third frame. The Elisabeth Moss-led sci-fi thriller generated $6million, enough for the No. 4 spot. So far, The Invisible Man has a cumulative tally of $64.4 million in the U.S. and Canada and $122million worldwide. Prior to Friday, fears of coronavirus didn't appear to impact moviegoing. But this weekend's box office results display that significantly fewer people are going to their local multiplex. Not since September 2000 has weekend box office revenue been so low, according to data firm Comscore, when $54.5million in tickets were sold on a quiet weekend.The steep decline pushed the year-to-date box office down almost 9%, according to Comscore. 'The impact of this unprecedented situation was apparent across many industries,' said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst with Comscore. 'Of course, movie theaters, amidst reduced capacity and an ever-evolving set of circumstances, had a very challenging weekend.' More people went to the movies the weekend after September 11, 2001. The two weekends after 9/11 grossed$66.3 million and $59.7 million respectively. Many theaters pledged to clean theaters in between screenings. Some theaters opted to close, including many cinemas in New York. Of the roughly 5,800 theaters in the United States, about 100 were closed over the weekend.But the wide majority of North American theaters remained open for business over the weekend. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  'With the worldwide coronavirus epidemic causing many domestic theater chains to go to reduced seating and many international territories to either completely or partially close all theaters, as well as creating uncertainty about going to crowded spaces, all titles have seen larger than expected drops,' Disney said in a statement. Health officials urged people to stay home and minimize social interaction, especially in states that have instituted bans on larger gatherings. California put a limit on gatherings of 250 people; New York set its ban at 500 people; Ohio banned gatherings of 100 people or more. Most of Europe's cinemas have shuttered in recent days, along with closures in China, India, South Korea, Italy Lebanon and Kuwait. Those closures have already slashed international grosses. The mass closures have already resulted in billions of dollars in lost revenues. Most of the entertainment world has shut down. Broadway theaters, major museums and theme parks have closed their doors. Concerts have been called off. Festivals including South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and the Tribeca Film Festival in New York have been canceled or delayed. Most live-action film production has been put on hiatus. Hollywood also has postponed most of its upcoming releases. Studio executives and media analysts recognize the global box office is in uncharted territory, with crucial developments unfolding at a rapid pace. Next week's most anticipated movie, A Quiet Place Part 2, has been removed from the schedule. Other major releases, including Disney's Mulan, Universal's Fast 9 and MGM's James Bond film No Time to Die have been pushed back. That means that even if movie theaters remain open in the coming weeks, they will have little to play. 'The marketplace has been hit very hard by the coronavirus and the effects this weekend are undeniable,' a distribution source told The Hollywood Reporter. 'The international marketplace is even worse as numbers seemed to fall apart in the U.K. and Germany as theaters are temporarily closing all over the world.' The iconic animated TV show has been known to foresee major world events - from Donald Trump's presidency to the discovery of a three-eyed mutant fish to the erection of London skyscraper The Shard. Here are some of the original predictions from across the four-decade-long run of The Simpsons - and the real-life events that transpired years later... 1: FAULTY VOTING PREDICTED IN:Treehouse of Horror XIX - 2008 CAME TRUE IN: Pennsylvania, USA - 2012 In2008, Homer was seen attempting to vote for Barack Obama in the US general election, only for the machine to keep switching his vote to Republican John McCain. Four years later, a voting machine in Pennsylvania was discovered to be changing people's votes from Obama, who was running for a second term, to Republican rival Mitt Romney. 2: OSAKA FLU AKA CORONAVIRUS PREDICTED IN: Marge In Chains - 1993 CAME TRUE IN: Wuhan, China - 2019 The episode featured a far-eastern virus called the Osaka Flu being transported across the globe and infecting the residents of Springfield, who were ordering Japanese juicing machines that had been coughed all over by infected factory workers. COVID-19 wasfirst reported inChina in December 2019. By March 2020 it was declared a global pandemic. 3: TOM HANKS HAS TO SELF-ISOLATE PREDICTED IN: The Simpsons Movie - 2007 CAME TRUE IN: Gold Coast, Australia - 2020 The Hollywood actor and his wife, Rita Wilson, caught COVID-19 while filming Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley biopic on location in Australia in March 2020. As a result, he and Rita had to go into isolation. In 2007's The Simpsons Movie - the big screen version of the TV show - Hanks makes a cameo appearance, in which he says: 'This is Tom Hanks saying if you see me in person, please, leave me be.' 4: THE ERECTION OF THE SHARD PREDICTED IN: Lisa's Wedding - 1995 CAME TRUE IN: London, UK - 2009 When Lisa visited a fortune teller, she foresaw that she would one day marry a British man. In the episode, she flies to London - where the skyline features a tall, pointed building. Fans have branded this a prediction that The Shard would one day be a fixture of London's architecture - eventually being built in 2009 and opening in 2013. 5: DONALD TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT PREDICTED IN: Bart To The Future - 2000 CAME TRUE IN: USA - 2016 In another flash-forward episode, Lisa is the president of the United States, having succeeded Donald Trump. She is seen lamenting the financial slump that Trump has left the country in, following his exit from office. This episode aired 16 years before even the idea of Trump taking over The White House was a possibility. He was elected as the 45th president of the United States on November 9, 2016. 6: BLINKY THE THREE-EYED MUTANT FISH PREDICTED IN:Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes On Every Fish - 1990 CAME TRUE IN: CÃ³rdoba, Argentina - 2011 Blinky, the three-eyed fish from The Simpsons first appeared in the second season of the show, when Bart caught it while fishing in the river by Springfield's nuclear power plant. In 2011, a fisherman in Argentina caught a three-eyed wolf fish, similarly in waters outside a power station. In both cases, the power plants were blamed for dumping toxic waste into the waters, thus affecting the wildlife. 7: KING'S LANDING IS DESTROYED BY DRAGONS PREDICTED IN:The Serfsons - 2017 CAME TRUE IN: Game Of Thrones - 2019 The Simpsons parodied Game Of Thrones in 2017, with the episode ending with the family watching their village obliterated by fire-breathing dragons. When the Game Of Thrones penultimate episode aired in 2019, King's Landing suffered the same fate whenDaenerys Targaryen ordered Drogon to burn the town to a crisp. 8: BABY TRANSLATOR PREDICTED IN:Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes? - 1992 CAME TRUE IN: Twain, East Asia - 2015 When Homer is awarded $2,000 in compensation for being exposed to nuclear radiation, making him infertile, his long-lost half-brother Herb shows up, looking for investment in an invention that translates 'baby babble' - using Maggie as a guinea pig. In 2016, app developers unveiled their Infant Cries Translator, which claimed to be able to decipher what a baby's sobs were trying to convey. 9: CENSORING MICHELANGELO'S DAVID PREDICTED IN:Itchy & Scratchy & Marge - 1990 CAME TRUE IN: Saint Petersburg, Russia - 2016 Marge became outraged by the violence in Bart and Lisa's favourite cartoon, The Itchy & Scratchy Show - and penned a letter of concern to the broadcasting network. This escalated into a full-blown protest which saw the cat and mouse cartoon toned down; instead of blowing each other up, they were seen sharing lemonade in harmony. When the famous sculptureMichelangelo's David was then due to stop on a tour in Springfield, Marge refused to join in with a local protest led by the likes of pious Maud Flanders, who claimed the statue was gratuitous. She was then accused of being a hypocrite. The precise same scenario cropped up in Russia 26 years later [minus the Itchy & Scratchy part], when residents of Saint Petersburg protested a replica of the naked sculpture which was due to be erected in the city. 10:ALL YOU CAN EAT LAW SUIT PREDICTED IN: New Kid On The Block - 1992 CAME TRUE IN:Massachusetts, USA - 2017 Homer was kicked out of an All You Can Eat venue for eating too much - causing the restaurant to run dry. He then became obsessed with fighting the case legally. A real-life case took place at the Golden Corral in 2017, when a man ate 50lbs of food, getting kicked out. He then sued the eatery for $2 million. "
32,All lined up with nowhere to go! Dozens of Lufthansa planes are pictured parked in a row at Berlin airport showing the scale of the crisis facing airlines - as BA calls for a bail-out,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114605/Scandinavian-Airlines-puts-operations-hold-non-existent-demand.html,"Dozens of Lufthansa planes were parked in rows at European airports today showing the scale of the crisis facing airlines due to coronavirus. The airline has been severely affected by the huge slump in demand caused by the virus and has cancelled the lion's share of its flight offerings. Pictures from Berlin and Frankfurt airport today show rows of planes waiting on the tarmac as they are no longer being used - showing the scale of the crisis. In addition Airline SAS will temporarily halt most of its flights from Monday until conditions for commercial aviation improve, it said, as demand for flights has 'more or less disappeared'. Airlines worldwide are cutting flights and costs amid plunging demand and US travel restrictions on European passengers during the coronavirus outbreak. Lufthansa is reported to have asked for state aid, while IAG's British Airwayssaid it was in a battle for its 'survival'. SAS, part-owned by Sweden and Denmark, said on Sunday it would temporarily lay off up to 10,000 employees, or 90% of the airline's total workforce. 'Demand for flights into, out of, and within Scandinavia has more or less disappeared,' chief executive Rickard Gustafson told a press briefing on Sunday. 'We have to adapt to current circumstances and starting tomorrow, Monday, we will temporary pause a large part of our operations and we will heavily reduce the number of flights in our entire network,' he added. Gustafson said the company had worked in the past few years to improve the financial stability of the company. 'Obviously, an airline with no revenue does not stand up for very long, but we have built good financial preparedness and good liquidity so we will manage for a good while,' he said. Gustafson said he welcomed measures announced by the Danish government on Sunday, in which the state covers 75% of employees' salaries in embattled Danish companies if they promise not to cut staff. 'I hope and believe that there is a lot of work being done on various solutions, both in terms of supporting the flight industry through this period, but also solutions for temporary reductions in personnel,' he said. On Friday, British Airways warned that its survival was at stake as its CEO told staff of plans to cut jobs and ground aircraft to tackle the 'worsening situation' caused by coronavirus. Finnair said on Sunday it was cancelling flights to Hong Kong, Madrid, Barcelona and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia from March 16-17, in addition to restrictions already announced. SAS said it would as far as possible maintain some flights within the next few days to enable people to return home. In a message the airline said: 'Due to the coronavirus and the measures implemented by national authorities, the demand for air travel is essentially non-existent. SAS has therefore decided to put most of its operations on hold, starting Monday March 16 and until necessary prerequisites for commercial air traffic returns. 'To support our customers, we will in the next few days do our utmost to uphold a certain level of operation to enable travelers to return from their destinations. 'Information regarding the traffic situation and specific flights will be constantly updated on our website. Affected passengers will be notified. 'The waiting time at our call centers is extraordinary long. We kindly ask that you only call us if your flight departs within the next 3 days.'"
33,Cops 'find NO evidence of drug use or suicide in the death of Floyd Mayweather's ex-girlfriend' who was embroiled in a $20million lawsuit against the boxerÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114055/Cops-NO-evidence-drug-use-suicide-death-Floyd-Mayweathers-ex.html,"Police found no evidence of drug use or suicide at the scene of Floyd Mayweather's ex-girlfriend's death, according to reports. Josie Harris, 40, the mother of the boxer's three children, was found dead in her car by police in California on Tuesday night. There was no suicide note or evidence of drugs at the scene, a police source told TMZ. She is understood to have been found by one of her children who then called 911. Harris was embroiled in a $20 million lawsuit against the boxer at the time of her death after he claimed he used domestic violence against her in 2010 because she was on drugs. Mayweather broke his silence following her death with a stream of flashback photos of the pair together on his Instagram feed on Friday, along with tributes calling her 'my rock' 'my friend' and 'my angel and 'my love'. The couple had a tumultuous relationship when they dated between 1995 and 2010. The boxing icon served two months in prison when he was convicted in 2010 of domestic violence against her. Police were not said to be treating her death as suspicious after she was found in a car outside her home in Valencia, Los Angeles County. DailyMail.com have contacted Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Medical Examiner-Coroner, who are determining the cause of death, for further comment. Harris' death was confirmed by Los Angeles police Wednesday. 'Homicide investigators have responded to the death of a woman,' the statement read. 'The woman was pronounced dead at the scene. There is no additional information available at this time.' Harris claimed that she was abused by Mayweather on six different occasions. In an interview with USA Today in 2014, Harris gave a sorry reflection of her time with Mayweather. 'I was a battered woman,' Harris said. 'I felt embarrassed about saying I was a battered woman. I felt shame. I felt like it was my fault. What did I do? I didn't understand what a battered woman was at that time. Now I know I was in a very dysfunctional, hostile relationship and a victim of domestic violence.' One of their children, their eldest son Koraun, witnessed the assault that saw Mayweather serve time and alerted authorities after sneaking out of his home. He called his father 'a coward' in the same interview his mother gave talking of her time with the boxer. '(My dad) said to lock my door and stay in my room,' Koraun said of the incident. 'I went back into my room and locked the door and then ran back out my bathroom and then hopped over the gate and went to the main entrance gate. I just told (the guard) that my mom was getting hurt and to call the ambulance and the police.' Harris didn't see Mayweather much past the jail term he served in 2010 but added: 'For some reason I still get anxiety when I know that he is on his way (to collect his children). 'I have no idea why, but I get really overwhelmed when I know that I have to be around him.' Mayweather, who is unbeaten in his 50 fights in his boxing career, claimed in a 2015 interview that his violence in 2010 was merely him trying to restrain Harris because she was on drugs. 'Did I kick, stomp and beat someone? No, that didn't happen,' he told Katie Couric. 'Did I restrain a woman that was on drugs? Yes, I did. So if they say that's domestic violence, then, you know what? I'm guilty. I'm guilty of restraining someone.' Harris vociferously denied the accusation and responded with a $20million lawsuit that was still to conclude at the time of her death. She was also in the process of writing a book about domestic violence survivors when she died. Harris has been described as a 'bright and loving soul' and a 'great spirit' as fans rush to pay tribute. 'You can tell Josie Harris had such a bright and loving soul. May she rest in peace,' commented Perez Hilton as the news spread Wednesday. 'Josie was an amazing woman who was kind loving generous loyal strong funny and most of all an amazing human who treated my children like they were her own,' commented Instagram user dayinthelifeofcams, who shared a picture of Harris she said she snapped herself. 'I will miss her beautiful soul. You were the light in the darkness Josie.' She added that Harris was 'more than Floyd's Ex she was a Beautiful Soul who would be so upset to know she is being referred to as just his Ex'. P This sentiment was followed by Slate writer Jamilah Lemieux who claimed Harris 'always deserved more than we gave her'. 'I hope someone takes the time to write a proper remembrance of Josie Harris's life. Gross to see outlets tripping over themselves to report ""Floyd Mayweather's baby mama"" died and having nothing to offer but a link to TMZ's post,' she added. 'Very sad news about Josie Harris. I interviewed her about 7 years ago - she had a great spirit and dope personality. Condolences to Floyd and her children,' said DJ Vlad. Her death was described as 'terrible news' by Twitter user B-Dill and as 'extremely sad news' by YBF Chic. "
34,Tyson Fury facing an EIGHT-YEAR BAN from boxing if he is found guilty by doping officials of tampering with evidence after shock claims from a farmer who says he was offered $30K to lie about supplying contaminated boar meat,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-8114521/Tyson-Fury-facing-eight-year-ban-boxing-guilty-doping-officials.html,"UK Anti-Doping are poised to open a new investigation into Tyson Fury and his cousin Hughie Fury after explosive allegations that a member of their team offered a farmer Â£25,000 to lie about how they each failed a drugs test in 2015. While the national doping watchdog is remaining tight-lipped, Sportsmail understands they are set to act on the extraordinary new information brought to light by the Mail on Sunday. If the Furys are found guilty of a potential new charge of tampering with the initial investigation - which led to backdated two-year bans for the Furys in 2017 for their nandrolone positives - then they would each be facing possible eight-year suspensions for a second offence. It comes after the startling claims of Lancashire farmer Martin Carefoot, who says he lied when he submitted two written statements to the Furys' legal team in 2017 to say he had supplied the fighters with uncastrated wild boar. The defence blamed the presence of nadrolone metabolites on the 'ingestion of offal of uncastrated wild boar or pig, or alternatively from contaminated supplements'. Carefoot has heaped huge uncertainty over the fighters by retracting the contents of his statements, copies of which have seen by Sportsmail. They are marked 'before the National Anti-Doping Panel between UK Anti-Doping v Tyson Luke Fury and Hughie Lewis Fury', and their possible use in the Furys' defence will be of particular relevance to any new UKAD inquiry. The Furys have not yet addressed the allegations, which include a claim from Carefoot that he was promised Â£25,000 from a member of their entourage, via a friend, for his complicity. The identity of the entourage member is known to Sportsmail. Fury posted a cryptic social media message in which he and an acquaintance were dressed as Batman and Robin, with the words: 'We was doing a half marathon today but got cancel for ovs [sic] reasons, but we gonna do a half marathon at home, Batman & robin. @kristianblacklock @toprank @wbcboxing @mtkglobal @frank_warren_official don't fear we coming........' Fury and his cousin both failed their respective drugs tests in February 2015 and after charges were brought in June 2016, it was not until December 2017 that the matter with UKAD was resolved, with a deal that saw them handed two-year bans, backdated to December 2015. After battles with mental health, alcohol and recreational drugs, which contributed to Fury being stripped of the world titles he won against Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015, he has since returned to the heavyweight pinnacle after beating Deontay Wilder for the WBC belt last month. These latest claims from Carefoot have therefore sent a shockwave through the sport. Tyson Fury's co-promoter Frank Warren strongly hit back at the farmer, saying in a statement: 'The farmer making these outrageous allegations sent me a letter last October, full of errors and basically telling me he had committed perjury by signing statements under oath and lying. When I called him, he asked for money. I told him to clear off and get in contact with UKAD. He chose not to speak to UKAD but instead speak to a newspaper. 'How anybody can take this man seriously is beyond belief. Tyson has never met this man in his life. What a load of rubbish. We'll leave this with UKAD to look into and don't expect it to go any further. 'It looks like while the football season has been paused, there's nothing to write about and silly season has instead commenced.' WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman gave Fury his backing in bizarre comments to The Sun. He said: 'Personally, I prefer to believe Tyson Fury ahead of someone who has already admitted to lying in legal documents for financial gain. 'The person who has claimed he accepted money to lie should be the one on trial, in my personal opinion, especially when he has waited five years to tell his story. 'Secondly, around this time Tyson was not involved with the WBC, he did not fight Klitschko for the WBC belt, it was for other titles, so this issue does not impact on him being our heavyweight world champion.' Robert Smith, the secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control, will raise the developments with UKAD. He told Sportsmail: 'I was made aware of it this morning. I will be discussing it when I meet with UKAD next week.' MTK Global, who represent Tyson and Hughie Fury, have not responded to a request for comment. The story was met with outrage among some of Tyson Fury's followers on social media. Some have vented their anger at Carefoot. Lancashire Police are aware of the situation with regards to Carefoot, who lives on a farm near Preston, and say they are monitoring the matter."
35,Dietician reveals wholegrain bread from the supermarket has JUST as many nutrients as a pricey artisan loaf - but says we should only eat one or two slices a day,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-7986995/Dietitian-reveals-bread-diet-fibre-low-fat.html,"Many of us cut bread out of our diets, believing it is 'bad' for us. But a dietician has explained that bread, at least loaves made with wholegrain, are packed with nutrients like iron, calcium and B-Vitamins and can be a great addition to a balanced diet. There is also no need to waste money buying pricey artisan loaves because they are just as 'good' for us as budget buys from the supermarket, according to UK-based nutrition consultant Juliette Kellow. 'Whether you make your own bread, buy a sliced loaf from the supermarket or choose an artisan loaf from a deli or bakery, the key is to choose a wholegrain variety,' Juliette told FEMAIL. 'As the name suggests, wholegrains contain all three parts of the grain â€“ the nutrient-rich germ, the energy-providing endosperm and the fibre-rich bran layer. 'When grains are refined, for example to make white flour, the outer bran layer and germ of the grain are stripped away, with the result that the grain loses much of its fibre and many of its nutrients. 'Bread made from wholegrain flour will result in a loaf thatâ€™s higher in fibre and contains more vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and antioxidants.' However bread should still be enjoyed in moderation, with portion sizes based on individual appetite and lifestyle. 'Healthy eating guidelines recommend starchy carbohydrates, which include bread, make up about a third of our diet,' Juliette explained. 'As a guideline, one to two medium slices is usually considered to suit most people (those or are very active may prefer more, those who are inactive may want less). 'Itâ€™s also important to watch what we put on our bread â€“ lashings of butter will add a lot of saturated fat while jam, marmalade and honey will add sugar. 'If youâ€™re using bread to make a sandwich, keep fillings healthier too â€“ lean meat, chicken, tinned tuna and salmon, eggs and avocado are lower in fat and salt than ham, bacon, salami and cheese; add plenty of salad; and limit or avoid extras such as pickle, ketchup and mayo, which can be loaded with fat and/or salt.' Here, Juliette has shared more advice on the nutrients found in bread.... Rich in calcium Juliette said: 'Most of us instantly think of dairy products when it comes to calcium-rich foods. 'Indeed, milk, yogurt and cheese are the main providers of this nutrient, which is needed for strong bones and teeth. However, white flour is fortified with calcium with the result that around a tenth of the calcium in our diets comes from white bread. 'Just one slice of white bread provides eight per cent of our daily needs for calcium. Even though wholemeal flour isn't fortified with this nutrient, one slice of wholemeal bread still provides five per cent of our daily calcium needs.' Good source of iron Juliette added that bread can be a great way to get iron, particularly for those on vegan and vegetarian diets. She said: 'Red meat is one of the main sources of iron in our diets. But, as we are encouraged to move towards a more plant-based diet, it's important to make sure we get enough iron in our diet from non-meat foods.It's good news, then, that white flour is fortified with iron. While some breads are high in carbohydrates, they tend to be low in fat. Juliette explained: 'Most bread is low in fat â€“ it's the butter or spread we add to it that boosts fat intake. 'Health guidelines in the UK recommend we have no more than 70g total fat and 20g saturated fat in our diet each day. 'A slice of bread contains around 1g fat and around 0.2g saturates, so contributes very little to this.' 'This makes bread an important source of iron, especially for teenage girls and young women, many of whom have very low intakes and so are at risk of a potential deficiency. 'One slice of white bread contributes around four per cent of our daily needs for iron, while one slice of wholemeal bread contributes seven per cent of our daily needs. Wholemeal flour isn't fortified with iron but it's naturally richer in this nutrient.' Rich in B-vitamins Juliette added that B-vitamins, that are essential for key bodily functions, are also found in bread. 'Most varieties of bread provide thiamin (vitamin B1) and niacin (vitamin B3),' she explained.These are both important for releasing energy from food and helping to keep the nervous system functioning well. 'Thiamin is also vital for the heart to function normally, while niacin helps to reduce tiredness and fatigue. 'One slice of white bread provides just under a tenth of our daily needs for each of these nutrients. One slice of wholemeal bread provides 9 per cent of our daily needs for thiamin and 16 per cent for niacin.' Not always loaded with sugar 'In recent years, bread has been highlighted as a food that contains a lot of added sugar,' Juliette explained. 'Sweeter breads such as brioche certainly contain more than a standard loaf, and some artisan loaves can be brushed with honey.But most standard loaves contain very little sugar â€“ around one to two grams per slice equal to quarter- half a teaspoon. 'Bread often comes under fire for being high in salt, especially some shop-bought alternatives, but ultimately, a wholemeal loaf can provide you with fibre, starchy carbohydrates and a variety of vitamins and minerals,' Juliette explained. 'Making your own bread at home gives you full control over exactly what goes into your loaf, allowing you to manage additional ingredients such as salt and sugar.' 'Bread manufacturers have worked hard to reduce the salt content of bread over the years and have certainly achieved this. Nevertheless, bread remains the main provider of salt in the food we eat, with a typical slice containing around 0.4g salt. 'One solution is to bake your own bread, giving you control over how much you add to the dough. While making bread can be fun â€“ it's a great thing to do with children â€“ if you plan to bake your own loaves regularly, then investing in a breadmaking machine is a great idea.' 'That's a small amount when compared with health guidelines in the UK, which recommend we have a daily maximum of 30g free sugars (the type of sugar that's typically added to food, as well as honey, syrups and fruit juices). 'It's the obvious sweet foods such as chocolate, sugary drinks, cakes, biscuits and puddings that contribute most of the sugar in our diet. 'In fact, bread provides less than three per cent of the added sugars in adult diets, confectionery on the other hand is responsible for a massive 28 per cent. Full of fibre Bread is full of fibre, which can make us feel fuller for longer, Juliette explained. 'Wholemeal varieties of bread really help to boost our intake of fibre, which we need for a healthy digestive system and to prevent constipation.Good intakes of fibre are also linked with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer' Juliette said. She added: 'Eating plenty of fibre-rich foods helps to fill us up, too, so we feel less hungry which can help us better manage our weight. 'Most of us fail to get enough fibre in our diet though, having an average of 18g a day, when in fact, health guidelines recommend almost twice this amount â€“ we should be aiming to reach 30g a day. Just one slice of wholemeal bread provides almost a tenth of our daily needs for fibre. Panasonic is supporting Love Food Hate Waste to help encourage people to reduce food wastage.

36,Meghan Markle's estranged brother calls on duchess to 'get off her high horse' and let her father fulfill his 'dying wish' of meeting Archie - and predicts 'divorce is on the cards' for her and Prince Harry,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8113967/Meghan-Markles-estranged-brother-urges-high-horse-let-dad-meet-Archie.html,"Meghan Markle's estranged brother Tom has urged the duchess to 'get off her high horse' and grant her father Thomas his 'dying wish' of meeting his grandson Archie. Thomas Markle Jr, 54, spoke out to encourage the former actress, 38, to call her dad - claiming the 75-year-old is 'frustrated' by his inability to reach his daughter and 'only has a few good years left'. He went on to predict that 'divorce is on the cards' for Meghan and Prince Harry - claiming his estranged sister willend up back Hollywood 'one way or the other'. In another cutting remark, he said Meghan was just 'a character in a series' and 'not an A-list actress'. Thomas Markle Jr told the Express: 'Meghan should actually just seriously get off her high horse, call her father, make amends.' After apologising for the part he played in the recent turmoil that tore his family apart, he went on to insist that Meghan needs to contact her 'bewildered' father. 'My dad's dying wish, he tells me on the phone, is just so he can just make amends and see Archie. And have his daughter back in his life â€“ I mean, we owe him that,' he said. 'He is so frustrated because he can't get a message to her. He is still bewildered, he is still lost, he is getting frustrated now to where he is just going to enjoy the rest of his life and he is just going to blow it off.' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they were stepping down as senior members of the Royal Family in January and completed their final engagements in the UK last week. While not much about their new life in North America has been confirmed, Tom has predicted that Meghan will definitely make a return to acting, after she left her role in the TV legal drama Suits ahead of her marriage to Prince Harry, 35. Thomas Jr added that working on Suits 'changed' Meghan and 'went to her head'. He alsocalled their decision to give up being part of the Royal Family 'mind-boggling' and predicted the couple will suffer under the strain of Meghan's desire to be 'in the limelight'. Thomas Jr added that he hopes they are 'madly in love' but claimed Harry has 'changed quite a bit' and they are both drastically changing their lives to 'suit her'. 'She walks in front of Harry. God forbid this ever happened, we really don't want to see Harry wallowing in the corner of a room with a bottle of gin,' he said. Thomas Markle's relationship with Meghan broke down ahead of her wedding to Harry in May 2018, whenit emerged he had posed for a paparazzi photographer. In an extraordinary Channel 5 film released last month, Meghan's father revealed the details of his last phone call with the Sussexes on the eve of their wedding, saying the decision to plan the photos will 'haunt me for the rest of my life'. He said: 'Harry said to me, ""If you had listened to me, this wouldn't have happened to you."" I said to him, ""It's too bad I didn't die because then you guys could pretend you were sad"" and then I hung up on them. I was done.' Thomas said he has not spoken to them since or met Archie, despite sending texts and letters, and added: 'I don't think at this point they're thrilled to see me or want to talk to me. The last time they might see me is being lowered into the ground.' In the 90-minute documentary, a visibly crestfallen Thomas described having to watch his daughter Meghan walk down the aisle on television as he recovered from a heart attack. He admitted he was 'jealous' of the Prince of Wales walking his daughter down the aisle as that was something he 'really wanted to do'. Thomas said: 'My daughter looked beautiful. I wish that I could have been there with her. I was certainly appreciative Charles was there. I admit I cried a bit about that. To this day I can't forget that moment.' Mr Markle, who divorced Meghan's mother Doria in the late 1980s, said the last time he spoke to his daughter was during an emotional series of phone calls days before her wedding. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new private life continuing to support charities close to their heart as they become financially independent. Yesterday it was reported Harry and Meghan have accepted an invitation from the Queen to join her at Balmoral this summer - and they could bring son Archie along for the first time. The Sussexes are also expected to spend time with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at Birkhall, Charles's retreat on the Balmoral estate, according to Roya Nikkhah writing in The Sunday Times."
37,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are 'fearful' of their future and their new post-Megxit life will 'take some getting used to', royal expert claims",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8113713/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-fearful-future-outside-Royal-Family-expert-claims.html,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are likely to be feeling 'fearful' of their future outside The Firm, a royal expert has claimed. Royal commentator Omid Scobie told how the Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 38, will be feeling anxious now they haveofficially completed their royal duties,and said their final farewells to their royal staff. 'They helped them fend off attacks from the tabloids and helped them organize tours and the amazing engagements,' he said, speaking to US television show Hollywood Access. 'It is that team that make all of that happen. For Harry and Meghan to leave all that behind there is probably going to be a sense of fear. The couple will officially take a 'step back' from their role as senior royals on March 31, where they will start a new life in Canada with their son Archie, 10 months.  'For Meghan Markle saying goodbye to her staff didn't just represent a sad ending for the relationship that they had working together, it also represented the end of her time as a working member of the Royal family,' explained Omid. 'The emotions were really heightened and there were tears and hugs. 'I think for Meghan she really appreciates the work that this very small team, that has become like a family to the couple, have done for them.' He added: 'They will be starting with an entirely new group of people once they are fully out of the Royal Family. 'That is going to take some time to really get used to.' However, the royal expert went on to say that the couple's decision to step back in a bid to become financially independent also means they will lose some of their privileges. 'While they may be making sacrifices of their own, they are losing a lot of privileges as non-working members of the Royal Family,' he said. 'Harry gave up his honouree military titles which has probably been the toughest pill to swallow for them.'"
38,"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry plan to open a new charity office at former BBC building in London which is now a 'workspace for creative thinkers' run by Soho House, a source claims",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8113741/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-plan-open-new-charity-office-London-former-BBC-building.html,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are said to be eyeing up a new charity office in a former BBC building, a source has told The Sun on Sunday. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they were stepping down as senior members of the Royal Family in January and completed their final engagements in the UK last week. Despite them starting a new life in the US and Canada, the couple have allegedly been on the lookout for a new UK base when they leave their Buckingham Palace offices at the end of the month. They are said to have chosen a space at theformer BBC Television Centre in White City, where ITV now films some of its programmes. The area in particular is run by co-working space Soho Works, a venture started up by Soho House - the hotel and private members club. The operation advertises itself as a 'workspace for creative thinkers', with a global community made up of Soho House members and 'people from creative industries who work and collaborate together in spaces that are designed to inspire'. One of the couple's close friends, Markus Anderson, of Peterborough, Ontario, is a consultant for the elite club brand Soho House andis said to have introduced Meghan, 38, and Harry, 35. Markus is so close to the former actress that she refers to him as uncle to her beloved dogs. The Sussexes enjoyed one of their first dates in London at Soho House's Dean Street Townhouse, andMeghan is thought to have held her hen party at the chain's Soho Farmhouse in Chipping Norton, Oxon. Travalyst, Harry's sustainable travel group, already operates out of offices in the old BBC building. A source told The Sun on Sunday that the offices seem like a 'perfect choice' for the couple given theirwell-known links to the chain. 'It would give them the privacy to do their charitable work but also a space with a bit of buzz,' they told the publication. 'They would be able to get in and out Â­without anyone noticing, with three exits and a drop-off point. It's a no-brainer for them to put their charity there. 'Although the family has moved to Canada they still fully intend to maintain charitable Â­activities here and felt it was vital to find a home for a new office in London.' The secure centre, which has card access-only doorways as well as a large, apartment-style loft with a separate library, lounge, meeting rooms and reception room for private functions, also features podcast recording equipment. Femail has reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment.

40,Miami's South Beach is shut down: Spring Break revelers are ordered to go home amid coronavirus pandemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113097/Spring-breakers-ordered-leave-South-Beach-famed-Florida-party-spot-closed.html,"Florida's famed South Beach is to close to prevent the spread of coronavirus as spring break revelers continue to party at the popular college getaway spot. Miami Beach officials ordered hundreds of college spring breakers and others from around the world off the beach Saturday evening as part of measures to prevent large gatherings. The most popular parts of the beach will close to the public from 4.30pm Saturday until March 19 withMiami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber declaring that spring break in Miami Beach is 'over' after a state of emergency was declared Thursday. Cases of the coronavirus in Florida jumped by a third on Saturday and now exceed 60. Two people have died in the state. City Manager Jimmy Morales enacted the emergency measures this weekend as party-hungry college students continued to travel to the popular spring break destination, despite the threat of the coronavirus outbreak and the news that President Trump is considering domestic travel restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control even greeted beachgoers with a floating billboard on Saturday which urged sunbathers to avoid contact with other people who are sick. Morales went a step further as the cases in Florida began to jump, opening up Ocean Drive to cars and deciding to close public beaches from 7th to 10th street along South Beach from 4.30pm Saturday to limit gatherings of spring breakers. 'Miami Beach is a popular vacation spot for spring breakers, yet with school closings and expanded spring breaks, the influx of visitors is extremely high,' Gelber said. 'It would be irresponsible for us not to limit crowd sizes in these public areas. 'Not only for our residents and visitors, but for the health and safety of our first responders. 'We cannot continue to put them at risk by asking them to expose themselves to the possibility of contracting this virus.' In an email to Gelber, Morales claimed that spring breakers 'don't seem to care about viruses' but that these measures should go some way to cutting down potentially harmful large gatherings. Police and civilian ambassadors were being called in to implement the 4.30pm closing down time. 'The idea is to force folks to make decisions to either go into the stores, restaurants or bars, or go back to their hotels to hang out,' Morales wrote to commissioners. 'The goal is to avoid the huge crowds that clearly pose both a health hazard and a public disorder risk.' 'Let's hope this approach makes a difference,' he added. Morales has emergency powers to enforce the closures until March 19. Miami Beach Commissioner Mark Samuelian added that strong measures were needed to ensure public safety and to curb the spread. 'It is certainly unprecedented,' he said. 'We're trying to keep people as healthy as possible, and specifically we are being advised by medical professionals that these type of large crowds are not in people's well being.' 'This is a public safety issue and we have got to address this,' he added. 'I support these measures and I believe it is the right thing for the community and frankly for the safety of these spring breakers.' As well as beach closures,restaurants and clubs in Miami Beach must, from Friday, restrict their occupancy to 250 people. Schools and universities across the United States are closing as the coronavirus impacts American's everyday lives, but that hasn't stopped young people from partying it up in Miami for spring break. Photos taken Thursday show scantily clad revelers taking to Miami Beach just hours after the city announced a state of emergency in the midst of the global pandemic. Gen Zers could be seen pouring cans of Limeritas and other alcoholic drinks on twerking girls in the ocean. And contrasting the surgical mask and gloves that have become a regular visual, these party-goers sported swim suits and trunks. Roughly seven people were arrested along Ocean Drive on Wednesday as police got into altercations with spring breakers. Six of those people were charged with resisting an officer without violence. Shocking video showed one officer and a woman colliding into each other in the commotion, only for the cop to then choke the woman and kick her down before arresting her. Gelber announced Thursday that City Manager Morales had declared a state of emergency in the city. The move granted the city managers special powers to close private clubs, limit beach access and install a curfew for the next three days. Gelber said that under the state of emergency, they city can and will suspend or refuse to pull special-event permits for large gatherings of more than 250 people for the next 30 days. Included in this time frame are the city-sponsored spring break concerts in South Beach and the Miami Beach Pride festival. 'To the extent that anybody can declare spring break is over, it is over this year,' Gelber said. 'We are the point of an economic engine, and it's incumbent on us to make sure that we lead the way in this effort."
41,Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Roberts reveals she's starring in a Netflix documentary about Jeffrey Epstein 'to tell the truth of what went on behind closed doors',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113337/Prince-Andrew-accuser-starring-Netflix-documentary-Jeffrey-Epstein.html,"The American woman who claims she was trafficked to Prince Andrewis set to appear in a new Netflix documentary revealing harrowing new details about her life as Jeffrey Epstein's alleged sex slave. Virginia Roberts, 36, confirmed the news Friday in a post on Twitter, revealing that she would appear in the series alongside several of Epstein's other alleged victims. 'The Netflix team were wonderful to me & my husband. They're looking to tell the world the truth of what went on behind closed doors,' she wrote. 'I hope the message reaches the voiceless & helps give them a voice & I hope the message is clear to anyone who thinks $= no justice thinks again!' Netflix revealed on Twitter that the series would be titled 'Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich' and would be made available to their 170 million customers later in the year. According to a synopsis, the series 'exposes a horrifying story of relentless manipulation and sex trafficking. Epstein's survivors serve as the series' pre-eminent voices, providing powerful testimonials about their experiences, and inspiration in their resilience.' One Twitter user praised news of the film in a message that was re-tweeted by Roberts herself. It read: 'Good! Serious Exposure! When will all co-conspirators be rounded up the FBI?#Epstein #PrinceAndrew #GhislaineMaxwell. Roberts claims she had sex with the Duke of York three times - once in London when she was 17, one time in New York and another at Epstein's private Caribbean island. The claims have been strongly denied by Prince Andrew. Last week, US federal prosecutor, Geoffrey S. Berman stated that the Prince had 'completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation' in the case against Epstein - with whom he was once friends. Epstein and Prince Andrew were pictured together numerous times over the years, including one time after the financier had been jailed on a sex offense charge. Meanwhile, Roberts recently stated that Epstein's Manhattan townhouse - which Andrew has admitted to visiting - was crawling with cameras. Roberts said that she has seen images from the cameras and that they were fitted throughout his house. 'I've seen the video rooms,' she said on Twitter. 'EVERY SINGLE ROOM was being filmed. I've even seen some of the pics.'  Meanwhile, Epstein's former girlfriend and 'associate' Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly told a socialite pal about the cameras. Christine Oxenberg last month told theNew York Post Maxwell 'said many things' about the cameras. 'All creepy. Unorthodox. Strange. I could not believe whatever she was saying was real. Stuff like: 'Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape'.' Oxenberg stated. Several other sources have also claimed that Epstein secretly filmed his guests using hidden surveillance cameras in the Manhattan mansion, according to The Telegraph. In response, Roberts question why there was a hold-up in the police investigation. 'Everyday I wake up hoping that someone has been help accountable and everyday I wake up disappointed,' she said. Prosecutors in the US are investigating sex trafficking allegations and are looking at possible 'conspirators' who worked with Epstein. Epstein, who died in August 2019, was found dead in his New York jail cell aged 66 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide but this has been disputed by his lawyers."

The video, which was shot earlier this week, shows an Asian couple walking along the platform at Times Square 42nd Street subway station in New York City. The pair appear to have just got off the train when the man begins harassing them both and yelling insults. 'I'm not f***ing playing. I'm calling the cops!' he threatens. The couple, who do not respond or even acknowledge the man's barbs, continue to walk arm-in-arm as they ignore him. As the couple attempt to make their way down a staircase, another individual appears and attempts to shield and protect the couple from the man's threats. At one point, the harassment becomes so great that the couple are forced to turn around and walk back along the platform to avoid confrontation. Their guardian chaperone follows them and even takes the arm of the woman who appears to be shocked by the treatment they are receiving. 'You wanna kill me? You wanna f***ing kill me?' the man yells at them as the abuse continues. New York City is encouraging citizens who are being harassed due to race, nation of origin or other identities to report such discrimination or harassment to the NYC Commission on Human Rights by calling 311."

They were treated at separate hospitals - the baby at North Middlesex and the mother at a specialist infections hospital. According to The Sun, the baby is now 'out of danger' and recovering well. It is believed the baby was infected after the birth from coughs or sneezes and it was tested within minutes of its arrival. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has advised that healthy babies should not be separated from infected mums and can be breastfed. Officials have advised the pregnant women and babies are at low risk from coronavirus and are likely to only endure mild symptoms. Unlike other infections, the mortality rate of coronavirus does not curve at both age groups, but only among the elderly. The news comes as the UK's coronavirus death rate doubled overnight to 21 and infections hit 1,140. Up to 20,000 people in Wales could die amid the coronavirus outbreak in a worst-case scenario, the country's health minister has said. Vaughan Gething laid bare the scale of the challenge the Welsh NHS is facing in a press conference in which he also announced non-urgent surgical procedures and outpatient appointments would be suspended. Mr Gething gave the worst-case figures while responding to criticism about his repeated refusal to ask the Welsh Rugby Union to postpone Wales's Guinness Six Nations clash against Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday, following the union's own decision to do so 24 hours before kick-off. On Thursday, he had said 'science doesn't tell us that it really makes a difference' that cancelling large events could save lives. On Friday, Mr Gething said: 'This is actually about how we make choices based on the best scientific advice available, based on the best advice of our chief medical officers. 'That's going to be the way the government behaves, because our priority is to save as many lives as possible. And it should not get away from the fact that is what we are talking about. 'In an average flu season across the UK, there are 8-10,000 deaths. In the worst-case scenario, as you know in Wales, for coronavirus could be over 20,000 deaths. 'That's the choice we are making in how to use our resources.' Meanwhile, Britain's over-70s will be told to stay at home for four months in a governmental bid to end the coronavirus crisis, it was revealed last night. Mass isolating of the elderly - even if they are not ill - will begin within the next 20 days as Boris Johnson ratchets up efforts to tackle the UK's ballooning outbreak. Although the drastic measures have been drawn up to protect those most vulnerable to the killer COVID-19 infection, it brings serious concerns about the wellbeing of pensioners cooped-up for such a long time. Regular social outings will have to be scrapped and pangs of loneliness could compound an already stressful isolation experience, psychologists have warned. Instructing the over-70s to remain indoors forms part of a wider package of emergency powers due to be officially rolled out by Downing Street this week. Tomorrow NHS England will hand out new guidelines for hospitals which will tell trusts they can scrap routine surgery and outpatient appointments, the Sunday Telegraph reports. It comes as senior forecaster Julian Jessop warned the paper that Britain could suffer a six per cent drop in GDP over coming months. Banning mass gatherings, allowing the police to detain suspected virus victims and forcing schools to stay open were already revealed to be part of the strategy going forward. And last night the government's coronavirus blueprint was fleshed out further as more impending measures emerged: Tomorrow NHS England will hand out new guidelines for hospitals which will tell trusts they can scrap routine surgery and outpatient appointments, the Sunday Telegraph reports.

45,What pregnant women need to know about coronavirus: Experts say there is no evidence an unborn baby can be infected during pregnancy and new mothers who test positive can still breastfeedÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113889/What-pregnant-women-need-know-coronavirus.html,"Pregnant women do not appear to be more susceptible to coronavirus than others and mothers are being advised to carry on breastfeeding, according to a new report. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have released new guidelines for pregnant women in relation to the coronavirus and have confirmed that there is no evidence the virus can be passed to an unborn baby. As a precautionary approach, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus when they go into labour are being advised to attend an obstetric unit - which has more doctors than a normal midwifery unit - for birth. The world's youngest coronavirus victim is a newborn baby in London, whose mother also tested positive for the disease after giving birth. The motherwas rushed to hospital days ago with suspected pneumonia but her positive result was only known after the birth. They were treated at separate hospitals - the baby at North Middlesex and the mother at a specialist infections hospital. According to The Sun, the baby is now 'out of danger' and recovering well. It is believed the baby was infected after the birth from coughs or sneezes and it was tested within minutes of its arrival. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has also advised that healthy babies should not be separated from infected mothers and can be breastfed. Dr Edward Morris, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: 'As this is a very new virus we are just beginning to learn about it, so the guidance will be kept under regular review as new evidence emerges. 'Over the coming weeks and months it is likely pregnant women in the UK will test positive for coronavirus. While the data is currently limited it is reassuring that there is no evidence that the virus can pass to a baby during pregnancy.' Gill Walton, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Midwives, assured pregnant women that it would be unlikely that they would not be able to give birth vaginally. She said: 'There is currently no evidence to suggest women cannot birth vaginally or they would be safer having a caesarean birth, so their birth plan should be followed as closely as possible.' Professor Russell Viner, President of The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: 'We don't believe that babies born to women who test positive for coronavirus should be separated. 'The impact of this separation, even as a precaution, can be significant on both the baby and the mother. We will review this recommendation as we see more evidence in the weeks and months ahead. 'There is also limited evidence about the transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk â€“ and based on what we know now, we feel the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks.' What effect does coronavirus have on pregnant women? Pregnant women do not appear to be more severely unwell if they develop coronavirus than the general population. As this is a new virus, how it may affect you is not yet clear. It is expected the large majority of pregnant women will experience only mild or moderate cold/flu like symptoms. More severe symptoms such as pneumonia appear to be more common in older people, those with weakened immune systems or long-term conditions. There are no reported deaths of pregnant women from coronavirus at the moment. If you are pregnant you are more vulnerable to getting infections than a woman who is not pregnant. If you have an underlying condition, such as asthma or diabetes, you may be more unwell if you have coronavirus. What effect will coronavirus have on my baby if I am diagnosed with the infection? As this is a very new virus we are just beginning to learn about it. There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage. There is also no evidence that the virus can pass to your developing baby while you are pregnant (this is called vertical transmission). It is therefore considered unlikely that if you have the virus it will cause abnormalities in your baby. Some babies born to women with symptoms of coronavirus in China have been born prematurely. It is unclear whether coronavirus caused this or the doctors made the decision for the baby to be born early because the woman was unwell. As we learn about the risk of pre-term birth and coronavirus infection, we will update this information. What can I do to reduce my risk of catching coronavirus? The most important thing to do is to wash your hands regularly and effectively as soon as you come from public places to your home or workplace. There is useful advice on the NHS website on the best way to reduce any infection risk, not just for coronavirus, but for other things like colds and flu. What is the travel advice if I am pregnant? If you are in the UK, you should follow the advice given by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which is being regularly updated in line with the evolving situation. All individuals, including pregnant women, should ensure they have adequate insurance arrangements prior to travel. You should also check that your travel insurance will provide cover for birth and care of your newborn baby if you give birth while abroad. What should I do if I think I may have coronavirus or been exposed? If you are pregnant and you have eithera high temperature or a new, continuous cough, you should stay at home for 7 days. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you are staying at home. You should contact the maternity unit looking after your pregnancy to inform them that you have symptoms suggestive of coronavirus, particularly if you have any routine appointments in the next 7 days. You should use the online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111 if: How will I be tested for coronavirus? The process for diagnosing coronavirus infection is changing rapidly. At the current time, only people with severe symptoms who require overnight admission to hospital will be tested. If you do require a test, you will be tested in the same way as anyone being tested, regardless of the fact that you are pregnant. Currently, the test involves swabs being taken from your mouth and nose. You may also be asked to cough up sputum, a mixture of saliva and mucous. What should I do if I test positive for coronavirus? If you test positive for coronavirus, you should contact your midwife or antenatal team to make them aware of your diagnosis. If you have no symptoms, or mild symptoms, you will be advised to recover at home. If you have more severe symptoms, you might be treated in a hospital setting. Why would I be asked to self-isolate? You may be advised to self-isolate because: What should I do if Iâ€™m asked to self-isolate? Pregnant women who have been advised to self-isolate should stay indoors and avoid contact with others for 7 days. The NHS guidance on self-isolation currently recommends people should: You may wish to consider online fitness routines to keep active, such as pregnancy yoga or Pilates. Can I still attend my antenatal appointments if I am in self-isolation? You should contact your midwife or antenatal clinic to inform them that you are currently in self-isolation for possible/confirmed coronavirus and request advice on attending routine antenatal appointments. It is likely that routine antenatal appointments will be delayed until isolation ends. If your midwife or doctor advises that your appointment cannot wait, the necessary arrangements will be made for you to be seen. For example, you may be asked to attend at a different time, or in a different clinic, to protect other patients. How will my care be managed after I have recovered from coronavirus? If you have confirmed coronavirus infection, as a precautionary approach, an ultrasound scan will be arranged 14 days after your recovery, to check that your baby is well. This 14 day period may be reduced as more information on how infected people are in recovery becomes available. If you have recovered from coronavirus and tested negative for the virus before you go into labour, where and how you give birth will not be affected by your previous illness. What do I do if I feel unwell or Iâ€™m worried about my baby during self-isolation? Pregnant women are advised not to attend maternity triage units or A&E unless in need of urgent pregnancy or medical care. If you have concerns about the wellbeing of yourself or your unborn baby during your self-isolation period, contact your midwife, or out-of-hours, your maternity team. They will provide further advice, including whether you need to attend hospital. If attendance at the maternity unit or hospital is advised, pregnant women are requested to travel by private transport, or arrange hospital transport, and alert the maternity triage reception once on the premises, prior to entering the hospital. Will being in self-isolation for suspected or confirmed coronavirus affect where I give birth? As a precautionary approach, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus when they go into labour, are being advised to attend an obstetric unit for birth, where the baby can be monitored using continuous electronic fetal monitoring, and your oxygen levels can be monitored hourly. The continuous fetal monitoring is to check how your baby is coping with labour. As continuous fetal monitoring can only take place in an obstetric unit, where doctors and midwives are present, it is not currently recommended that you give birth at home or in a midwife led unit, where only midwifes would be present. We will keep this advice continually updated as new evidence emerges. Will being in self-isolation for suspected or confirmed coronavirus affect how I give birth? There is currently no evidence to suggest you cannot give birth vaginally or that you would be safer having a caesarean birth if you have suspected or confirmed coronavirus, so your birth plan should be followed as closely as possible based on your wishes. However, if your respiratory condition (breathing) suggested that urgent delivery would be needed, a caesarean birth may be recommended. There is no evidence that women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cannot have an epidural or a spinal block. However, the use of Entonox (gas and air) may increase aerosolisation and spread of the virus, so your maternity team will discuss all the options with you in early labour to ensure you are aware of the pain relief options available to you. What happens if I go into labour during my self-isolation period? If you go into labour, you should call your maternity unit for advice, and inform them that you have suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection. If you have mild symptoms, you will be encouraged to remain at home (self-isolating) in early labour, as per standard practice. Your maternity team have been advised on ways to ensure you and your baby receive safe, quality care, respecting your birth plan as closely as possible. When you and your maternity team decide you need to attend the maternity unit, general recommendations about hospital attendance will apply: Could I pass coronavirus to my baby? As this is a new virus, there is limited evidence about managing women with coronavirus infection in women who have just given birth; however, there are no reports of women diagnosed with coronavirus during the third trimester of pregnancy having passed the virus to their babies while in the womb. Will my baby be tested for coronavirus? Yes, if you have suspected or confirmed coronavirus at the time your baby is born, your baby will be tested for coronavirus. Will I be able to stay with my baby/give skin-to-skin if I have suspected or confirmed coronavirus? Yes, if that is your choice. Provided your baby is well and doesnâ€™t require care in the neonatal unit, you will be kept together after you have given birth. There are some reports from China which suggest women with confirmed coronavirus have been advised to separate from their baby for 14 days. However, this may have potential negative effects on feeding and bonding. A discussion about the risks and benefits should take place between you and your family and the doctors caring for your baby (neonatologists) to individualise care for your baby. This guidance may change as knowledge evolves. Will I be able to breastfeed my baby if I have suspected or confirmed coronavirus? Yes. At the moment there is no evidence that the virus can be carried in breastmilk, so itâ€™s felt that the well-recognised benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk. The main risk of breastfeeding is close contact between you and your baby, as you may share infective airborne droplets, leading to infection of the baby after birth. A discussion about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding should take place between you and your family and your maternity team. This guidance may change as knowledge evolves. If you choose to breastfeed your baby, the following precautions are recommended: If you choose to feed your baby with formula or expressed milk, it is recommend that you follow strict adherence to sterilisation guidelines. If you are expressing breast milk in hospital, a dedicated breast pump should be used. What is the advice if I am a healthcare worker and pregnant? We understand that it must be an anxious time if you work in healthcare and you are pregnant. To the best of our knowledge, pregnant healthcare professionals are no more personally susceptible to the virus or its complications than their non-pregnant colleagues. However, infection with coronavirus may pose some risks to your unborn baby. There is a possible risk of fetal growth restriction, or of premature birth if you become seriously unwell. You should discuss your individual circumstances your local Occupational Health department. Source:The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists "
46,France shuts down its ski resorts two months early as country is put on lockdown after coronavirus death toll rises to 91Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113845/France-shuts-ski-resorts-two-months-early.html,"All French ski resorts are closing on Sunday and will not reopen for the rest of the season as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, ski resort operators said, dealing another heavy blow to France's tourism industry. 'The ski season ends today,' Domaines Skiables de France, which group's the country's resort operators, said on Twitter. Holiday-makers and professionals, we're all passionate about skiing and must face up to the seriousness of the situation.' Most resorts usually close in April or early May. The shutdown comes just three weeks before the French and British school holidays, one of the busiest periods of the season. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced on Saturday evening that France would shut all shops, restaurants and entertainment sites. It comes as French voters used hand sanitiser and face masks to head to the polls to cast their vote during local elections, despite the coronavirus lockdown. They have also been asked to bring their own pens and stand three-feet away from each other as they turn out to vote in local elections for mayors and municipal councils. President Emmanuel Macron committed to the vote last night as he placed the country in lockdown and closed all 'non-essential public places' including cafes, bars and restaurants. But officials fear that many will stay away despite assurances that the most basic measures will protect even the most vulnerable. France reported a surge in coronavirus cases by 832 last night, bringing its total to 4,499. As many as 91 people have died from the virus. There has also been a rapid increase in serious cases, said head of public health Jerome Salomon, with 150 people below the age of 60 in intensive care."
47,'Imagine getting COVID-19 then being roasted for using too much Vegemite!' Fans mock Tom Hanks for his VERY liberal use of the popular Australian sandwich spread as he recovers from coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8113693/Fans-mock-Tom-Hanks-using-Vegemite-recovers-coronavirus-hospital.html,"Tom Hanks thanked his carers at the Gold Coast University Hospital on Sunday, where he and wife Rita Wilson are being treated forcoronavirus. But the 63-year-old actor's Twitter post grabbed the attention of fans for all the wrong reasons - namely the very thick spread of Vegemite Tom applied to his toast. In the photo accompanying his tribute, the Forrest Gump actor showcased his breakfast, featuring a tube of Vegemite, with a kangaroo toy nearby. He captioned the post: 'Thanks to the Helpers. Let's take care of ourselves and each other. Hanx' - but all anyone could talk about was his thick Vegemite. The yeast sandwich spread is a household staple in Australia, but most consumers use just a thin smattering across buttered bread. And that had fans up in arms, with many gently mocking the actor for his over-application of Vegemite despite his current medical condition. One person Tweeted: 'That's enough Vegemite to kill a horse. Hanx don't play. #usesparingly'. Another added: 'Tom, I mean this with all the respect and love in the world, but that is too much Vegemite.' Someone else Tweeted: 'That Vegemite is so thick I am SHAKING' while another added: 'Mate, what's going on with that Vegemite ratio?' Yet one more chimed in: 'Tom... the amount of Vegemite... you're scaring me, Tom'. Others were amused that Australian fans were so outraged by Tom's incorrect use of Vegemite that they were even mocking him while he's ill. One fan Tweeted: 'Imagine getting COVID-19 then being roasted on Twitter for using too much Vegemite!' Another said: 'I so love this... most replies: 'hey, love youse! But dead set too much Vegemite!'' Some fans however insisted that a lot of Vegemite is best - and in fact is the 'professional level' amount, supporting his choice. Others still think the spread may be therapeutic, with one person writing: 'That much Vegemite is going to destroy the coronavirus'. Tom and Rita first announced their positive diagnosis last Wednesday, listing the symptoms that led to them being tested. 'We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too,' Tom shared in a social media post. Since then theyhave been sharing updates on their health, as well as the activities they've been doing to get through this tough time. The couple have been married since 1988, and share two sons together, Chester and Truman. Tom also has a son and daughter, Colin and Elizabeth, from his first marriage to Samantha Lewes. Globally there have been more than 156,054 cases of coronavirus, with the death tally already surpassing 5,000. In Australia, as of Sunday afternoon, there were 280 reported cases of coronavirus, including three deaths."
48,Coronavirus spreads across Africa with six new countries confirming cases as nations race to try and contain outbreak,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113887/Coronavirus-spreads-Africa-six-new-countries-confirming-cases.html,"Africa is seeing a steady spread of the coronavirus across the continent, with six new countries confirming cases on Saturday. It means 25 of the continent's 54 countries have COVID-19 patients, with the Republic of Congo being the latest country reporting a case, late Saturday. Eswatini, Equatorial Guinea, Mauritania, Namibia and Rwanda also confirmed their first cases Saturday. All were brought to the continent by travelers from overseas, as with almost all the other cases reported in Africa, according to health authorities. The Republic of Congo government reported its first case of the coronavirus on Saturday and said that a duel French and Republic of Congo citizen returned from Paris on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on March 1. After recently showing symptoms, they alerted authorities. The government asked that others on that flight come forward. African governments and health officials are racing to try to contain the spread of the new virus on the continent of 1.3billion people. If the disease spreads locally within the continent, health officials warn that several countries with fragile health systems could see higher mortality rates. Namibia, which confirmed two cases of people who arrived from Spain, canceled its independence celebrations planned for March 21. The funds that were to have been spent on the independence festivities will now be used to fight the further spread of the coronavirus, said officials. President Hage Geingob will be sworn into a second term of office, but all other large gatherings have been suspended for the next 30 days. Flights linking Namibia to and from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany have been suspended for 30 days. In response to two cases it confirmed on Saturday, Mauritania closed schools for a week, reduced border crossing points, placed a ban on public gatherings and called for travelers from countries at risk to voluntarily confine themselves at home. In South Africa, 14 new cases were confirmed Saturday, bringing the country's total to 38. A South African military plane repatriated 121 South African students who had been stranded in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak first became a crisis.The South African jet landed at the Polokwane airport in the country's north. All passengers had tested negative before the flight back from China but as a precautionary measure the group, including the crew, will be in quarantine for 21 days at a nearby hotel. The roads leading to both entrances of the Ranch Resort are being patrolled by the army and police, authorities said. Africa's hospitals may not be adequately prepared to care for large numbers of people who may need intensive care and ventilators, say health experts."
49,"Coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals and facilities in Iran warns top government official after record 113 deaths and 1,209 new cases in 24 hours brings total to 724 deaths and 13,938 infectedÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113975/Coronavirus-overwhelm-hospitals-facilities-Iran-warns-government-official.html,"A leading Iranian official has admitted that hospitals in the country could be overwhelmed by the coronavirus after a record 113 deaths and 1,209 new cases were reported in just 24 hours. It was the first time that more than 100 people had died from the virus in a single day in the Islamic nation. In total, 724 people have died in Iran and there are 13,338 confirmed cases, though questions about the government's transparency suggest the real figure could be even higher. Now,Ali Reza Zali, who is leading Iran's official campaign against the outbreak, has admitted Iran could run out of hospital beds. He told the state-run IRNA news agency: 'If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity.' Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics if needed. Zali also acknowledged that 'many' of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly. Health Ministry figures show that while 55 per cent of fatalities were in their 60s, some 15 per cent were younger than 40. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks. In Iran, the virus has infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials. Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open. Dalia Samhouri, a senior regional official with the World Health Organization, said both Iran and Egypt, two of the most populous countries in the Middle East, were likely under-reporting cases because of the nature of the virus, which can be spread by individuals who show no visible symptoms. Egypt has reported 110 cases, including two fatalities. 'We can easily say that the current figures are an underestimation of the actual figures,' she said. Iran has struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. The U.S. says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it. Muslim authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, would be closed indefinitely due to concerns about the outbreak, with prayers continuing to be held on the sprawling esplanade outside. Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday proposed a six-month 'emergency government' to confront the coronavirus crisis and end a political deadlock after the country's third inconclusive election in less than a year. With Netanyahu facing criminal charges in three corruption cases - his trial was supposed to start on Tuesday - political rivals quickly cast aspersions on his motives. The right-wing Likud party leader made the offer to his main political challenger, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, as Israel's president was poised to choose a candidate this week to try to put together a governing coalition. Neither Likud nor Blue and White won enough seats in parliament in the March 2 election to secure a ruling majority on their own, or with the support of potential coalition partners. Netanyahu said on Twitter that a 'national emergency government ... led by me' would - unlike Israel's current caretaker administration - be able to pass a budget and make 'difficult decisions' in the face of an 'international and a national crisis'. Several other nations have announced emergency containment measures as the killer virus grips the globe. Vietnam's health ministry on Sunday said all passengers coming from or through China, South Korea, the UK and Schengen countries will be compulsorily quarantined and tested for coronavirus. 'The compulsory quarantine applies to arrivals from March 14,' the health ministry said in a statement. 'Those whose tests are positive will get immediate treatment while the rest will be quarantined for 14 days.' The ministry in a separate statement said people, including foreigners, were required to wear face masks in public places. The authorities of Hanoi & Ho Chi Minh City also asked all forms of entertainment establishments including bars, karaoke bars and several tourist sites to close until the end of March. The Philippines recorded three additional coronavirus deaths and 29 new cases, bringing the domestic tally of infections to 140, as authorities placed the entire capital Manila under 'community quarantine' for about a month beginning Sunday. The latest deaths include an 86-year-old American male with travel history from the United States and South Korea, the Department of Health said in an advisory. The other two are Filipinos. In total, 11 people have died from the virus in the country, according to the health department. Domestic land, sea and air travel to and from Metro Manila is now restricted, while stringent measures to contain or prevent local transmission have been imposed in other parts of the Southeast Asian country. Major shopping malls in Metro Manila, home to at least 12 million people, have heeded the authorities' call for a temporary partial closure to discourage people from leaving their homes, while a nighttime curfew will begin on Monday. Supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, bookstores and hardware stores will be kept open, while restaurants may also operate but only for home deliveries, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said. Brunei meanwhile said that its citizens and foreign residents in the country are barred from leaving the Southeast Asian nation due to the coronavirus outbreak. The health ministry also said it had confirmed 10 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total tally to 50. It has also been announced that Nike stores in the US, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand will be closed from March 16 to 27."
50,"Feds seize FAKE coronavirus testing kits at Los Angeles airport, warn consumers against 'bogus' products",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113159/Fake-coronavirus-testing-kits-seized-Los-Angeles-airport.html,"Federal authorities warned consumers Saturday about fake home-testing kits for the coronavirus after customs agents intercepted a package at Los Angeles International Airport filled with vials labeled as COVID-19 test kits. The parcel arriving from the United Kingdom this week was declared as purified water vials valued at nearly $200. But when U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspected it they discovered the labels referring to the new virus that began in China and has spread globally. ""The American public should be aware of bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings,"" the agency said in a statement Saturday. Testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is only conducted in verified state and local public laboratories across the country. On Friday, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and laid out new testing strategies after health care professionals, politicians and patients across the country complained about lack of access to testing. However, public confusion persisted over who should be tested and how to get checked for the disease. No further details, including any arrest connected to the intercepted package, were released. The vials were turned over to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for analysis. U.S. officials are bracing for a dramatic acceleration of cases â€” beyond the roughly 2,200 that have been documented so far in 49 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, like fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Yet as the gravity of the crisis had seeped into public consciousness, suddenly everyone is shrinking from public gatherings of any real size for fear of contracting the virus, and organizers canâ€™t call off events fast enough. The NBA and the NHL suspended the rest of their seasons. The NCAA dropped its wildly popular March Madness basketball tournament. Broadway is closed. St. Patrickâ€™s Day parades are scrubbed. Hunkered down at home, Americans are leaving restaurants empty, hotels vacant and jetliners unoccupied."

Eat your meals at home,' she tweeted. 'If you are healthy, you could be spreading COVID,' she added. She directed the public to stay at least six feet away from others to avoid potentially spreading the virus. To Twitter's delight, AOC received support from the conservative Republican senator from Texas. 'Good advice â€” not just for NYC, but everywhere. If you can stay home, stay home. And wash your hands,' Cruz tweeted. 'When Ted Cruz and AOC agree on something, I think it's time to listen,"" one Twitter user said. 'I just saw Ted Cruz retweeting AOC and am now convinced of the apocalypse,' another joked. On Tuesday Ocasio rebuked the public for being racist toward Asian businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, China, but it now under control there. She blasted New Yorkers for refusing to support Asian shops and restaurants fearing infection, leading to a plummet in their business. 'Honestly, it sounds almost so silly to say, but there's a lot of restaurants that are feeling the pain of racism,' she said in an Instagram Live. 'People are literally not patronizing Chinese restaurants. They're not patronizing Asian restaurants because of just straight-up racism around the coronavirus.' As of Saturday night, there are more than 2,900 cases of the virus in the United States and 58 deaths. On Friday, AOC blasted the US response to the coronavirus, saying more needs to be done. The New York Democrat hit out at Donald Trump's claim that the US 'has the best healthcare system anywhere in the world', pointing out that South Korea is testing 10,000 per day compared to just a handful in the US. 'It almost seems like the more wealthy and powerful you are, the more able you are to access a test,' she told Fox News on Thursday. 'But the rougher the road you've got here, the more difficult it will be to access healthcare. That's exactly the recipe for a disaster in a pandemic.' Widespread problems have been reported across the country with coronavirus testing, with medics unable to keep up with demand. While the White House has promised that millions of Americans will get test kits, data available suggests that number is currently in the low tens of thousands. The CDC admitted that it had only tested 77 people in the first two days of this week, while state numbers recorded by the COVID Tracking Project late Thursday reported 15,000 tests had been carried out. But inconsistencies in the data â€“ with some states only reporting positive results and others reporting none at all â€“ means the true figure remains unknown. On Friday Trump declared a national state of emergency, a move that would open the door to get $50billion in emergency funding to states. He also announced a travel ban from foreigners entering the country through Europe, which was extended Saturday to include travelers from the UK. The ban excludes American citizens."

Finnish artist Kari Kola lit up the mountains in Connemara, County Galway, Ireland in the traditional colours of St Patrick's Day of blue and green with his work of 1,000 lights. Mr Kola's light work of 1,000 lights beamed on to the mountains next toLough Na Fuaiche, one of Ireland's glacial lakes. Scroll down for video His artwork, named Savage Beauty, spanned a total of five kilometres across the Connemara mountains. The event was supposed to run this from Saturday to Tuesday, but this was cancelled and the production team had to dismantle the work last night. Ireland cancelled its usual parade through the streets of Dublin amid fears of spreading the disease. Ireland has today recorded its second death to the virus, and all schools in the country have been closed. Jim Lenaghan wrote online:'Kari Kola's beautiful lighting instalation 'Savage Beauty' did get its chance to shine at Lough Na Fuaiche last night in an unannounced tech run & to be videoed. 'It was stunning! Mountain mist swirled around the uplands making the whole thing very ethereal'. The work is now an art piece that people can view online. The Irish Government has advised that anyone with coronavirus symptoms must self-isolate and stay indoors. Mr Kola said of the cancellation: 'With abstract light, there are as many stories as there are viewers. 'If I can choose, I always work with nature because that's the best art that we have. I am very disappointed that the public exhibition of this work had to be cancelled, but I hope that this digital edition will show how we played with scale in Connemara and created something that people would not expect.'"
53,US braces for spring storms amid coronavirus panic: Rain and flash floods will hit the Southeast while up to six feet of mountain snow will be dumped on the Northern plains this weekend,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8112613/Spring-storms-hit-weekend.html,"Western states and the Plains will be hit with severe rain, thunderstorms, and heavy snow this weekend. A low-pressure storm system will move slowly across the Southwest battering it with rain and flash floods while bringing snow the Northern and Central plains. Just last week the region was hit with one to three inches of rain. Storms already started to brew in southwest Texas overnight on Friday. Artic air is forecast to blow over the northern Rockies and Northwest states this weekend, bringing rain and heavy snow in mountainous areas. This week the Plains can expect light snow accumulations in Nebraska, lowa and Illinois.Meanwhile Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky will be hit with much heavier rain. On Saturday a strong storm system will bring snow from California to Montana. The Sierra Nevada Mountains are expected to see multiple days of severe snow and white-out conditions that could reach more than six feet in some regions through Wednesday. 'This particular setup may deprive the Washington and Oregon Cascades of more than a foot of snow, but the eastern slopes of the northern Rockies, and especially the Sierra Nevada, can pick up several feet of snow from the storm,'AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. Officials are warning that high country will see potentially three to five feet of snow through Tuesday in addition to rain, which could increase the risk of avalanches. Cities from Los Angeles to San Diego will experience several rain showers as well. Rainy weather has drenched Southern California since Thursday. In addition to rain and snow, strong winds with blast through the region peaking over speeds of 45mph through Washington state to Nevada. In the Southern California mountains more than one foot of snow is possible. In the same region two to four inches of rain is forecast which could trigger flooding. Portland, Oregon which saw temperatures in the 60s this week, will see a major dip in temperature, even down to the middle 20s at night this weekend, as well as snow. Snow and wind is already battering northern Idaho where it covered streets in white and toppled trees. A utility company in the area reported over 10,000 customers were without power in Bonner, Idaho. The storm system will hit higher elevations and rain will spread southward along the Pacific Coast then it will spin offshore."
54,How I beat my insomnia and how you can too: DR MICHAEL MOSLEY on how we need less sleep than we think and how the eight hours 'rule' is a myth,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8112723/DR-MICHAEL-MOSLEY-beat-insomnia-too.html,"It's bizarre, when you think about it, that we spend about a third of our lives happily unconscious. That is, unless youâ€™re one of the 16 million Britons for whom sleep is often elusive. Iâ€™m one of them: for the past two decades Iâ€™ve suffered with intermittent insomnia which, at times, has driven me to despair. So, some years ago, I decided to find out why it was happening, and what I could do about it. I was fortunate that my investigations began at a time when a revolution in sleep research was just kicking off â€“ scientists now understand better than ever exactly what happens when we nod off (itâ€™s not, as was once assumed, â€˜nothing at allâ€™). Indeed, sleep is essential for every aspect of our health and wellbeing. During my research, Iâ€™ve met dozens of sleep scientists and interviewed hundreds of people â€“ from firefighters to astronauts, to police officers â€“ about their sleep patterns. Iâ€™ve also spent many nights in sleep labs with electrodes attached to my head and body. Iâ€™ve taken drugs to put me to sleep, and drugs to keep me awake. Iâ€™ve also seen clear evidence of the truly devastating impact that chronic sleep deprivation has, not just on the body but the brain and digestive system. It reduces the ability to retain memories and to fight infections â€“ which is crucial in these troubling times. And chronic lack of sleep is linked to an increased risk of diseases like type 2 diabetes, dementia and depression. Fortunately, new research has also revealed a range of surprising and highly effective ways to improve the quality and quantity of your sleep. The results of my investigations form the centrepiece of my new book, Fast Asleep â€“ a guide to achieving restful slumber for life, backed by the latest scientific research. Crucial to this is my approach to sleeping better â€“ and even curing insomnia. It may seem counter-intuitive, but trust me, it really works. Many people have been be surprised by my solutions to a lifetime of troubled sleep. As I said in part one of this series in the Daily Mail yesterday, my approach involves restricting the amount of sleep you have. It is a type of evidence-based treatment called Sleep Restriction Therapy. For a few weeks, you deliberately reduce the amount of time you spend in bed. You start off on the first week by staying up two hours more than you normally would. And then, each week for the next month, shave 20 minutes off that time. By the end of it, you should be sleeping well. If youâ€™re not getting enough sleep, you usually know about it. But, for a more objective measure of how sleep-deprived you are, try the Sleep Onset Latency Test, developed by a famous sleep researcher, Professor Nathaniel Kleitman from the University of Chicago. Youâ€™ll need a metal spoon and metal tray. 1. Skip your morning coffee or tea. 2. In the early afternoon â€“ any time between 1pm and 3pm â€“ go to your bedroom and draw the curtains, taking the spoon and tray. 3. Place the tray on the floor by your bed, check the time then hang your arm over the side of the bed, holding the spoon. 4. Close your eyes and try to drift off. If you fall asleep, the spoon will drop from your fingers with a loud clang, waking you up. Check the time as soon as that happens. If you fall asleep within five minutes of closing your eyes, it means you are severely sleep-deprived. Taking ten to 15 minutes suggests a mild problem. If youâ€™re awake for more than 15 minutes, youâ€™re probably fine. Studies have shown that this sort of approach reboots your brain, and works more effectively than anything else, including drugs. Staying up until youâ€™re really tired eliminates the classic mistakes problem sleepers make â€“ lying awake, fretting about not sleeping. All this does is set up a bad behaviour pattern, where your brain comes to associate being in bed with feeling stressed. Another big factor for how well we sleep is diet. Fibre-rich foods, like grains, fruits and vegetables, have a direct impact on the healthy bugs in our guts and, in turn, on sleep-enhancing chemicals in our brains. In todayâ€™s You magazine, you will find 14 exclusive, mouthwatering recipes, all packed with naturally sleep-inducing ingredients, created by my wife, GP Dr Clare Bailey. But first, I want to reveal some of the methods I used to win my own battle with insomnia and how I now manage six hours most nights, which is a real achievement. I wasnâ€™t always a poor sleeper. My problems didnâ€™t really strike until my late 20s. Before that, I could sleep anytime, anywhere. Then, in the late 1980s, I began working in television, married my wife Clare â€“ then a hard working junior doctor â€“ and we had children. As anyone knows, having children does terrible things to your sleep patterns â€“ and itâ€™s not just when theyâ€™re babies. By the time Clare and I entered our 40s, the children â€“ and my wife â€“ were sleeping through the night. But Iâ€™d developed the classic signs of insomnia. I would lie there for what felt like hours or wake up at three in the morning with thoughts rushing through my head. Going to bed, once a real pleasure, was something I began to approach with a sense of dread. I became increasingly fascinated with the mysterious state of sleeplessness. And, when I learnt about a man who gets by on a couple of hours sleep each night â€“ and is perfectly healthy â€“ I had to meet him. Tony Wright is a Cornishman who, in 2007, managed to break the world sleep deprivation record by staying awake for 266 hours (11 days). His story made me wonder how long I could go without sleep. So, I decided to complete a similar challenge and asked if heâ€™d join in, to give me tips and moral support. Before we started we completed some tests to establish things such as reaction times and mood. Then, after a decent nightâ€™s sleep, we began the most challenging stunt I have ever attempted. I didnâ€™t think the first 24 hours were too bad. But my test results showed that I was already falling apart. Having stayed up for a day and a night, my reaction times slowed right down. I was irritable and distracted. When I did a car simulation test I kept on crashing. But, amazingly, Tony was holding up well. His reaction times, grip strength, balance and results of the car simulation showed no sign of deteriorating. I struggled on, keeping myself busy by pacing around, singing and playing pool. We werenâ€™t allowed caffeinated drinks â€“ just water. Interestingly, among the gloom, there were little bursts of euphoria. After 48 hours without sleep I watched the sun rise and felt gloriously alive â€“ the light from the rising sun affects the parts of the brain that governs the sleep and wake cycle â€“ the circadian clock. The light was perking me up, triggering the release of hormones and other body chemicals that make us alert, and getting me ready for a new day. The feeling continued for a few hours. But by mid-afternoon, on day two, I had to fight to keep my eyes open. My blood pressure was up, my blood sugar had soared and I had a thundering headache. When I began to hallucinate the hotel walls were caving in, I knew it was time to give up this particular experiment. I staggered to my bed and took a final look at my watch â€“ Iâ€™d managed 64 hours (two and a half days) without sleep. So why did Tony show little sign of sleep deprivation? No one knows for certain, but I think the most likely explanation lies in his genes. In August 2019, University of California researchers found a family with a genetic mutation that let them live happily on four hours sleep a night. The mutation is in a gene called ADRB1, which alters activity in various regions of the brain that regulate sleep. But these mutations are incredibly rare in humans, which is why most of us need at least six hours a night. By the way, itâ€™s a popular misconception that we need eight hours. Most studies show people get by fine on six and a half hours, and the much repeated eight hours usually counts all the time spent in bed, including when not actually asleep. We rarely encounter extreme sleep deprivation in life. But even a moderate sleep deficit can build up and cause damage, playing havoc with levels of hormones that govern appetite, stress, growth and the immune system. One thing that Iâ€™m sure made my own insomnia worse over the years, was being on the heavier side. I was overweight, with too much fat around my gut. As a result I developed raised blood sugars which put me in the diabetic range. Thankfully, I have since managed to rid myself of the disease but back when I was bigger, I slept terribly. Partly because I snored so much â€“ more common in those who are overweight or obese, because excess fat around the neck can make it difficult to breathe. As soon as I lost weight, my sleep improved (and as Clare will confirm, my snoring reduced, too). Itâ€™s also important to realise that sleep and weight gain are intrinsically linked. I discovered this when I took part in an experiment at the University of Leeds. Sleeping badly was making me put on even more weight. During the experiment, I â€“ along with a group of healthy volunteers â€“ cut back my time in bed to less than four hours for two consecutive nights. We wore glucose monitors which measured our blood sugar levels. I noticed that, at the times I felt the most exhausted, I had cravings for foods Iâ€™d never eat nowadays â€“ biscuits and chocolate. After two nights of normal sleep to recover, we all travelled up to Leeds to get our results. Everyone complained about having the munchies during the experiment. Some polished off packets of custard creams before going to bed. Readings of my blood sugars showed they soared when I was most sleep deprived, reaching the level youâ€™d expect to see in someone with type 2 diabetes. But all returned to normal after a good nightâ€™s sleep. So why did this happen? Well, being sleep deprived alters your appetite hormones, making you feel hungry more often, and less likely to feel full. The body produces more of the stress hormone cortisol while awake, which can make blood sugar levels fluctuate the next day. Both these things combine to make us more prone to eating when tired. Another big turning point for me was a psychological one: discovering how common my form of insomnia is â€“ and not getting too worked up about it. Previously, I resented the fact that Iâ€™d wake up at 3.30am. But waking in the middle of the night was once considered normal. Roger Ekirch, a history professor from Virginia Tech University, said in pre-industrial times it was common to go to bed a few hours after dusk, wake up and do some chores for a few hours, then go back for a second sleep. The pressures of the industrial age and arrival of electric lights changed that: it allowed us to work later, and stay up later. Soon sleeping continuously became the new normal. These days, if I wake up, rather than lie there fretting, I get up, go to another room, listen to music, meditate or read a boring book. When I begin to feel sleepy, usually after about 30-40 minutes, I go back to my bedroom for my â€˜second sleepâ€™. Since I have accepted that I am unlikely to return to sleeping soundly every night, Iâ€™ve felt more rested, less stressed and less likely to nod off during the day. It's deep sleep you really need - and here's how to get much more During my countless wretched hours spent trying, and failing, to fall asleep, Iâ€™ve often wondered: Why do we need to sleep at all? Well, after years of intense research into the weird and wonderful world of the sleeping brain, I have a pretty good idea. And it is quite astounding. Just about everything you rely on your brain to do while you are awake is only possible due to complex processes that happen while youâ€™re asleep. According to anthropologists, the evolution of our subconscious brain workings is part of the reason human beings have risen to the top of the animal kingdom. It turns out the best stuff happens during what scientists call deep sleep, which occurs about an hour into falling asleep.So rather than fretting about the number of hours you get, itâ€™s far better to improve the quality of the sleep you do have. And, contrary to popular thought, the way to do this is not by drinking mugs of hot milk or listening to whale music. Youâ€™ll find more of the remedies that donâ€™t work in the panel on the next page â€“ and some that do later on. But first, I want you to join me on a magical, mysterious tour inside our sleeping brains. Have you ever wondered why, just before falling asleep, you feel as though youâ€™re falling off a cliff or a bridge and suddenly kick out your leg? Or if thereâ€™s any physiological point in dreaming? University of Surrey researchers asked 200 men to eat cheese every night for a week and record their dreams. There was no evidence of increased nightmares. Here, Iâ€™ll explain everything youâ€™ve ever wanted to know about what happens when we sleep â€“ and why each stage is so important. Letâ€™s start with the three distinct states: light sleep, deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We sleep in roughly 90-minute cycles through the night, flipping between one state and another. After about an hour of light sleep, youâ€™ll slip into deep sleep, when you are hardest to rouse. Involuntary twitches are common between these two states, as the brain transitions from one to the other. Deep sleep occurs during the first half of the night, and the second half of the night is dominated by REM sleep. Weâ€™ll get to REM sleep â€“ which is where dreams usually occur â€“ a bit later. But deep sleep, which totals a couple of hours each night in young, healthy people, is where most of the brilliant stuff happens. Millions of neurons in the brain are firing all at once, pausing, then firing again. This process ensures that lots of important repair work, all over the body, gets done. Your pituitary gland â€“ a gland below the base of the brain â€“ starts to secrete more growth hormones, which are vital for cell growth and healing.Deep sleep also helps you fight infections by creating more cytokines, a type of protein that regulates your immune system. Another essential role of deep sleep is washing away toxins that have built up in your brain throughout the day. Your brain does this via a network of channels, known as the glymphatic system. These channels open up and pump cerebrospinal fluid through your brain tissue while you are in deep sleep. As we get older, sleep becomes more fragmented â€“ although itâ€™s not totally clear why older people sleep less well. It means our brain, and the glymphatic system, becomes less able to complete this â€˜washingâ€™ process. Scientists have suggested that this may be one of the reasons the risk of Alzheimerâ€™s increases as we age, because broken sleep means there is less opportunity to wash away toxic proteins in the brain that are responsible for the disease. STORAGE SYSTEM SORTS OUT OUR MEMORIES Have you ever wondered why, out of the hundreds of sights, sounds and tastes that happen to you everyday, you only remember a select few? The answer lies with your sleeping brain â€“ which is rather like a sophisticated sorting office. An hour or so into deep sleep, your brain begins deciding which memories it wants to keep and which to discard, leaving space for new ones. Memories considered important are shifted from the hippocampus (the short-term storage area) to the safety of the prefrontal cortex, for long-term storage. The memories left behind in the hippocampus are deleted. Itâ€™s like sorting out photos and videos on your phone and getting rid of the duds to free up space. One recent estimate puts the brainâ€™s storage capacity at 1,000 terabytes, which is a billion megabytes. A computer with that capacity could store around two billion books. Scientists believe this holds some of the answers as to why we become more forgetful as we age. Studies show that the less deep sleep we get â€“ remember, the older we get, the less we sleep â€“ the more forgetful we are. Researchers at the University of Berkeley measured the sleeping brain activity of twenty-somethings and over 70s. They found that the older volunteers got 75 per cent less deep sleep than their younger counterparts. When they were tested on memory tasks, the over 70s performed much more poorly than the twenty-somethings. In fact, as soon as we hit 50, the amount of deep sleep we get dramatically reduces. And by the time you get to my age â€“ 63 â€“ youâ€™re averaging 30 minutes nightly. HOW DREAMING HELPS US ALL COPE WITH TRAUMA The second half of the night is when we enter the state everyone wants to know about â€“ dreaming. Or, more specifically, the peculiar state of repetitive eye movement, or REM. If weâ€™re going to dream, this is when weâ€™re most likely to do so. If you ever get the chance to, watch somebody while theyâ€™re in the second half of sleep â€“ itâ€™s rather extraordinary. Youâ€™ll notice their breathing becoming short and shallow. They may seem more bonded to the bed, as the muscles become paralysed. Underneath the eyelids their eyes begin flicking madly to and fro. Sleep scientists think this is probably a sign that weâ€™re in the middle of a vivid dream. Itâ€™s thought that these strange eye movements allow us to change from one scene to another, a bit like watching a film. But dreams arenâ€™t just for our entertainment â€“ they play a crucial role in helping us to work through painful memories. This is also why most of our muscles are paralysed during REM sleep. If you are in the grips of an intense, dramatic dream, we donâ€™t want to be thrashing around and hurting ourselves. So how does REM sleep help us process our emotions? It is all to do with our brainsâ€™ emotion centre, the amygdala â€“ the two almond-shaped groups of cells located deep in the brain. When we are awake and encounter stressful situations, the amygdala triggers the release of â€˜fight or flightâ€™ hormones such as adrenaline. This causes your heart rate and blood pressure to shoot up, breathing gets rapid and you feel nervous, sweaty and sometimes nauseous. But during REM sleep, the amygdala switches off this reaction. This means that, while the dreams we have during REM sleep can be scary and disturbing, they are nothing like as bad as they would be if you were awake. It means you can revisit unpleasant memories, but remain calm, which allows you to process your emotions and defuse them. And different dreams give us clues to our underlying emotions. Our brains then try to work through it at a time with physical symptoms paused. Anxiety is a particularly common feeling to crop up in dreams. If youâ€™ve ever dreamt your teeth are falling out, youâ€™re falling off a cliff or high building, or speaking in a public space without clothes on, youâ€™re probably feeling anxious. My most common anxiety dream is driving too fast along a narrow road and then plunging down a cliff to my death. My wife tells me I sometimes drive too fast â€“ perhaps my dreams are telling me I should listen to her. If you are plagued by dreams such as these, it suggests there is a lot of stress in your life that you might want to address. But dreams can have a positive effect, too. Research has shown that a sleep rich in REM increases our ability to come up with novel ideas and solutions to problems. There are lots of lovely stories about people who have had their eureka moments while they slept. Paul McCartney says the tune for Yesterday came to him while he was asleep, and the Rolling Stonesâ€™ Keith Richards came up with the opening verse to Satisfaction. WHY ROUTINE, EXERCISE (AND SEX) ARE CRUCIAL So how can you improve the amount of deep sleep, to reap all its benefits? First, work out how much of this high-quality sleep you are getting, by calculating your sleep efficiency. Use a wearable sleep-tracker, such as a Fitbit, to precisely record the amount of time you spend asleep, and keep track of how many hours you spend in bed. Then, convert hours into minutes. If total time in bed is eight hours and 30 minutes, thatâ€™s 510 minutes If total time asleep is six hours and 10 minutes, thatâ€™s 370 minutes. Then, divide the first by the second. In this case, your sleep efficiency is 370/510 = 72.5 per cent. A score above 85 per cent is good, but less than 80 per cent suggests you are struggling. If you are in bed for eight hours each night, but only sleep for six, then your sleep efficiency is 6/8, or 75 per cent, which is poor. Thankfully, there are science-backed ways to improve this. If your lack of deep sleep is having a significant effect on your mood, memory and ability to concentrate, you may want to try sleep- restriction therapy â€“ which I explained earlier. Otherwise, the key to improving your sleep efficiency is to establish a good routine. That starts with getting up at the same time every day. You should aim to get at least 30 minutes of morning light as soon as you can â€“ this will help reset your circadian clock, the time keeper in your brain that tells you when to sleep and when to wake up. Also, exercise, at any time of day, will help you sleep. Studies show that resistance exercise such as press-ups and squats are particularly effective for improving deep sleep. I try to do 40 of each when I get out of bed in the morning. Thereâ€™s something else that might help, too â€“ sex. Australian studies have found that intimate moments result in significant reductions in stress hormones such as cortisol, which can inhibit deep sleep. Fast Asleep: How To Get A Really Good Nightâ€™s Rest, by Dr Michael Mosley, published by Short Books, is out now."
55,'How about you amaze me and do the right thing': Simone Biles fires back at USA Gymnastics and demands an independent investigation into team doctor Larry Nassar after they wish her a Happy Birthday on Twitter,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114141/Simone-Biles-slams-USA-Gymnastics-wish-happy-birthday.html,"Simone Biles has slammed USA Gymnastics in a fiery tweet after they wished her Happy Birthday and she responded demanding they conduct an independent investigation into disgraced Team USA doctor Larry Nassar. The Olympic gold medalist celebrated her 23rd birthday on Saturday and USA Gymnastics shared a post praising the decorated gymnast. 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most decorated gymnast of all time, @simonebiles! We know you will only continue to amaze us and make history!' Biles shared the post writing: 'How about you amaze me and do the right thing...have an independent investigation.' Biles is one of the slew of some 200 girls and women who have accused USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse. Furthermore she and other Olympic athletes have slammed USAG's proposed $215million settlement for survivors of Nassar's sexual abuse. Biles along with other athletes including gymnast Aly Raisman have demanded an independent investigation by USAG and the US Olympic and Paralympic committees into the scandal, saying the settlement doesn't hold staffers who allegedly knew about or buried Nassar's abuse accountable. In 2017 Nassar was sentenced to an effective life sentence on charges of child pornography and sexual misconduct in both federal and state courtrooms He was accused by at least 250 women of sexually abusing them over the past two decades. The Nassar scandal smeared USAG's reputation and led the organization to file for bankruptcy in late 2018. According to a bombshell 2019 report following an 18-month congressional investigation into the Nassar scandal, the FBI, USAG, US Olumpic Committee and Michigan State all had a chance to stop Nassar's abuse and 'failed to do so'. Twitter users praised Biles for her clapback with one fan tweeting: 'Me writing in @Simone_Biles on the primary ballot.' 'This is the type of thing only a select few can do...her...a Lebron....a Brady.....but they donâ€™t the two dudes I listed donâ€™t have the guts. Simone is a hero,' another fan added. 'So many reasons you are the GOAT. Strength in 100 different ways,' one social media fan added."
56,'Don't do what we did - people are needlessly dying': Italian journalist urges UK and US to lockdown NOW amid coronavirus pandemicÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8112777/Italian-urges-UK-lockdown-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"An Italian journalist is warning Britons to 'stay home' amid the coronavirus pandemic as one of the country's top doctors warns Covid-19 is 'apocalyptic'. The stark pleas to ban mass gatherings, avoid contact with others, and self-isolate in the UK and US come as 60million Italians endure a national lockdown. Mattia Ferraresi, who writes forIl Foglio, has argued the Italian Government wasted time in not acting decisively and drastically early on. He said thatItaly's universal healthcare system has been 'felled' by Covid-19, which has infected 17,000 confirmed cases in the Mediterranean country. The Italian journalist described life in the lockdown as an 'exercise in humility' and urged Britons to sacrifice 'individual freedom in order to protect everybody'. Writing inThe Boston Globenewspaper, Mr Ferraresi, of Rome,said: 'Until last week, the Italian public healthcare system had the capacity to care for everyone. 'Our country has universal healthcare, so patients aren't turned away from hospitals here. But in a matter of days, the system was being felled by a virus that I, and many other Italians, had failed to take seriously. 'It didn't have to come to this. We of course couldn't stop the emergence of a previously unknown and deadly virus. 'But we could have mitigated the situation we are now in, in which people who could have been saved are dying. I, and too many others, could have taken a simple yet morally loaded action: We could have stayed home.' He blasted 'less-than-urgent appeals to the public' by Governments across the planet to make small behavioural changes, arguing 'when the terrible outcomes they are designed to prevent... become evident, it's generally too late to act'. 'When everybody's health is at stake, true freedom is to follow instructions,' he said. Elsewhere,Giuseppe Natalini -head of intensive care at the Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital in Brescia - called Italy's crisis 'catastrophic, unimaginable'. He told The Times newspaper: 'If someone had told me on February 21 that today we would be in this situation, I would not have believed it. 'Two or three weeks ago I would have considered the strict measures that have been in place in Italy disproportionate and alarmist. Now, absolutely not.' DrNatalini added: 'You'd be fools to get burnt like us.' Italy became the first country in Europe last week to impose a lockdown to combat the spreading Covid-19 illness as more than 17,000 people are infected. The Mediterranean country's death toll hit over 1,200 - making Italy the worst-hit country outside of China, where the disease first incubated.

57,French voters use hand sanitizer and face masks as they head to the polls despite country going on lockdown after death toll soared to 91,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113709/French-voters-use-hand-sanitiser-face-masks-head-polls-despite-lockdown.html,"Jet2 has suspended all flights to France with immediate effect as voters head to the polls for elections that have been allowed to go ahead despite the country's coronavirus lockdown. The budget airline, which ordered planes heading for Spain to perform a dramatic U-turn yesterday, said it would no longer fly to Lyon, Grenoble, Paris and Nice until at least April 26. President Emmanuel Macron placed France on lockdown last night and banned the opening of all 'non-essential public places' including cafes, bars and restaurants. But he still gave the green light to local elections for 35,000 mayors and half-a-million municipal councils today with hygiene measures in place. France reported a surge in coronavirus cases by 832 last night, bringing its total to 4,499. As many as 91 people have died from the virus. Therehas also been a rapid increase in serious cases, said head of public health Jerome Salomon, with 150 people below the age of 60 in intensive care. In a statement the airline said: 'The French government has announced a range of restrictions, aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. As a result we will not be flying any customers to (France) with immediate effect.' They said customers already in France would be placed onto rescue flights. Those in Grenoble and Lyon will be flown back to the UK on Saturday March 21. Britons stranded in Paris will be flown back today and tomorrow. And those in Nice will be flown back tomorrow. 'We are contacting our customers who are currently in (these areas), to advise them of their options,' they said. 'We urge customers not to call us as we will be in touch. This is a fast-moving and complex situation, and we would like to thank our customers for their understanding. The health and safety of our customers is always our number one priority.' It was not clear what additional welfare packages are being offered to customers in Grenoble and Lyon, who will have to wait six days for their rescue flight. The move comes after Ryanair said it would 'severely reduce' flights to and from Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from midnight tonight. Easyjet has announced it will cancel all flights to Spain from March 17. French voters were pictured wearing protective gear and standing at least three-feet away from each other when they came to vote today. Many had been asked to bring their own pens. Polling booth staff also wore face masks and latex gloves, and asked attendees to use hand sanitiser upon entry and exit. Municipalities said they would also regularly disinfect voting booths. France opened its polls at 8am (7am GMT) and will continue to accept votes until 6pm (5pm GMT), 7pm (6pm GMT) or 8pm (7pm GMT), depending on the municipality. Turnout is predicted to be low for this election as many voters steer clear of the polls. By noon today (11am GMT) it had fallen to 18 per cent of the country, a five per cent drop compared to the local elections in 2014. Disagreeing with holding the vote, voter Pascale, 59, who wore a mask to visit a polling booth in Paris' seventh district, said: 'It's really not responsible. It will discredit the message for the seriousness of the situation. 'I've got a lot of friends and family that will not go even if they usually carry out their civic duty.' A 60-year-old woman who voted in Paris said: 'I am going to vote and keep living my life no matter what. I am not scared of the virus.' A second round of voting is scheduled in France for March 22, but prime minister Philippe has suggested that these could be pushed back. Observers say many are bound to shun the democratic exercise for fear of contamination with the virus. A recent opinion poll said 28 percent of potential voters in France were 'concerned' about the risk posed by mingling at polling stations, often hosted by schools. 'It is important at this time, following the advice of scientists as we have done, to ensure the continuity of our democratic life and that of our institutions,' Macron said. Some 47.7 million people are registered to vote in some 35,000 municipalities in a country where mayors and local councillors enjoy high popularity compared to other levels of government. Boris Johnson, who has not called for a lockdown, has pushed back the UK's local and mayoral elections due to be held in May by a year. The election will be a key test for Macron, whose party swept Paris in the 2017 presidential election, but has since lost popularity in part due to its leader's perceived autocratic leadership style and lack of common touch. The French capital will be the main battleground, with incumbent socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo challenged by right-wing heavyweight Rachida Dati and Macron's candidate Agnes Buzyn - who was parachuted in after his chosen hopeful, Benjamin Griveaux, pulled out over a sex-tape scandal. Many in France have questioned the wisdom of holding the vote even as the country indefinitely closed all creches, schools and universities, banned gatherings of more than 100 people, and urged residents to limit their movements. But French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner defended his government's decision, saying there were about 1,000 voters to every French polling station on average. And even if the participation rate is 60 percent -- which is high - that would mean 600 people spread over 10 to 12 hours depending on the district. The risk from voting for the elderly was no greater 'than going shopping', insisted Jean-Francois Delfraissy, chairman of France's coronavirus science council. 'It is certain that many people will be dissuaded from voting,' political historian Jean Garrigues of the University of Orleans told AFP. Polls showed that young people - who are not at high risk of dying from COVID-19 - are most likely to hold it up as a reason not to vote. Even if this is just a pretext for the politically apathetic, it could impact parties that young people are more likely to support - the Greens and the far-left France Unbowed, said Garrigues. Older people, even though they are more motivated to vote, may end up staying away out of fear, thus robbing parties such as the right-wing Republicans or Macron's centre-right Republic on the Move (LREM) of votes. This means that the political repercussions of high voter abstention among the young and the old could cancel each other out, said Garrigues. France was placed on lockdown last night as Prime Minister Edouard Philippe called the virus the 'biggest health crisis in a century'. In a solemn TV address on Saturday evening, Mr Philippe said the indefinite shut down would apply to 'all places that receive the public but which are not essential to the life of the country.' Public transport will remain open but Mr Philippe encouraged his citizens to limit their use. Exceptions on France's ban include supermarkets, pharmacies, banks and petrol stations. Mr Philippe added that his citizens will have to make tough sacrifices in the coming months to help stop the spread of the killer virus - which could cost the economy billions. 'I am conscious of the efforts and sacrifices that we are asking, but I have faith that the French people will have the capacity to overcome this serious moment,' Philippe said. Philippe said the government had been left with no choice but to take the decision because too many people were still out in the streets and not sufficiently applying measures that were recently announced. That, he said, was helping accelerate the spread of the virus. 'I have decided to close all non-indispensable locations. We must absolutely limit our movements,' he said. The ban is also likely to include ski hire shops, and other businesses linked to the country's Alpine resorts, many of which are likely now to shut down too. It follows President Emmanuel Macron appearing on national television on Thursday and saying the 'national crisis' meant all schools, colleges and universities will close from Monday. 'Despite our efforts, the virus is accelerating,' Mr Macron said. 'It will hit the most vulnerable people first and we are taking great efforts to increase massively the capacity in our hospitals. 'We have to prepare for the second wave, which will hit younger people. We have to prepare our emergency staff. We need to win time, but the priority is to protect the most vulnerable. 'For our collective interest, from Monday and until further notice, nurseries, schools, colleges, high schools and universities will be closed. 'Closed for a simple reason: our children and our youngest, according to scientists, are the ones who seem to spread the virus the fastest.' Religious buildings would remain open but gatherings and ceremonies should be postponed."

59,"My guilt over my insane success, by $110million Daniel Radcliffe: Star reveals how his drinking spiraled out of control after he panicked about life after Harry PotterÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8113143/My-guilt-insane-success-90million-Daniel-Radcliffe.html,"Playing Harry Potter brought him worldwide fame and a Â£90 million fortune when he was still a teenager, but Daniel Radcliffe today reveals his guilt at enjoying such 'insane' success so young. The actor, a star since the age of 12 thanks to his role as the schoolboy wizard in the eight films of J. K. Rowling's books, says the feeling has fuelled his work ethic since his final Potter movie in 2011. In an interview for Radio 4's Desert Island Discs today, Radcliffe, 30, says: 'I'll always have a part of my brain that is going â€“ when I first walk into a rehearsal room â€“ 'Everyone just thinks you are here because of Harry Potter', and in a large part they are right. 'So you have to make sure you are bringing something else to the table. But if that's the thing that makes me work hard, then fine. 'I have been insanely lucky and I think probably I have a vague sense of guilt about having something so amazing happen to you so young.' Radcliffe also admits to struggling with the intense scrutiny of growing up in the limelight, which prompted him to seek solace in alcohol. His drinking spiralled out of control when he began to 'panic' about life after Harry Potter. He says: 'I definitely think a lot of the drinking that happened towards the end of Potter, and for a little bit after it finished, it was panic and not knowing what to do next, and not being comfortable enough in who I was to remain sober.' The star, who stopped drinking in 2010, says it was 'weird' to realise he had to be sober at such a young age, but he was ultimately 'very, very happy' to do it. He adds: 'But I will always be fascinated and frustrated by the question of: is this something that would have happened anyway or was this to do with Potter? 'I will never know. It runs in my family, generations back. Definitely not my mum and dad, I hasten to add.' Radcliffe, who has been dating 35-year-old American actress Erin Darke since they met on the set of 2013's Kill Your Darlings, suffers from a mild form of the neurological disorder dyspraxia, and reveals that he struggled with his writing at school. That led some teachers to dismiss him as 'thick'. 'I wasn't very good at school,' he admits. 'I was nice, I wasn't totally disruptive. But I was not good academically. Just the act of writing took me an unbelievably long time. That was a struggle so I think they thought maybe 'He's a bit thick' or something.' Radcliffe credits an eye condition for helping him land his first starring role, in the BBC's 1999 adaptation of David Copperfield. He says: 'I have a slightly lazy eye and when I am tired, it will blink on its own â€“ like Homer Simpson when he is drunk. I walked into this room and looked at the director and gave him like a one-eyed blink and he thought, 'Who is this confident kid who has just winked at me?' 'Apparently that was a large reason why I got a call back.' Desert Island Discs is broadcast today at 11.15am."
60,AOC refused to campaign for Sanders after the Iowa caucuses 'because Bernie backed Joe Rogan' who has been criticized by the LGBT community for his views on trans children,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8112179/AOC-refused-publicly-stump-Bernie-Iowa-caucuses-Sanders-promoted-Joe-Rogan.html,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez refused to do more active campaigning for Bernie Sanders in protest of the presidential candidateâ€™s embrace of controversial podcaster Joe Rogan, it has been reported. The House rep, who has become a rising star among progressives since her shock election victory in 2018, did not deny a report that she turned down repeated requests by Sandersâ€™ campaign to appear at his rallies in recent weeks. While Ocasio-Cortez did speak at two large-scale rallies on behalf of Sanders in New Hampshire and Michigan, the senatorâ€™s presidential campaign had to make a considerable effort just to get her there. â€˜It was like pulling teeth to get her to New Hampshire,â€™ a source told Huffington Post. After several invitations, Ocasio-Cortez finally agreed to speak at the rally in Durham, New Hampshire, just days before the February 12 first-in-the-nation primary. In the weeks that followed, however, the New York congresswoman was nowhere to be found, a fact noted by several political observers. From February 11 until March 8, Ocasio-Cortez declined several invites to speak on behalf of Sanders. The campaign asked her to appear at rallies in Nevada, South Carolina, and some of the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday, the Huffington Post reported. During that period, Sanders went from being the front runner following his impressive showings in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, to falling behind the current delegate leader, Joe Biden. Biden crushed Sanders in the South Carolina primary and went on to capture the most delegates on Super Tuesday - capping a stunning reversal from just days earlier. With Sandersâ€™ campaign reeling and in desperate need of help, it was again turned to Ocasio-Cortez, who agreed at the last minute to deliver a get-out-the-vote speech at a rally for the Vermont senator in Ann Arbor, Michigan, last Sunday. On the night before the rally, Sandersâ€™ campaign issued a revised media advisory noting that Ocasio-Cortez would be speaking at the event. The recent absence of Ocasio-Cortez at Sandersâ€™ rallies is in marked contrast to the intense stumping she did for the senator in the fall and winter. Ocasio-Cortez spoke for Sanders at 15 rallies and demonstrations beginning in October and stretching into January - the most notable appearance being at a major demonstration in Queens, New York, that drew an estimated 26,000 people. She agreed to appear on behalf of Sanders while the senator was stuck in Washington, DC, where he needed to be present for President Trumpâ€™s impeachment trial. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders in mid-October, and the campaign praised her for the support, especially after the senator suffered a heart attack. â€˜Senator Sanders and our campaign will never forget that in one of the most difficult moments for us, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez gave us a boost with her strong endorsement,â€™ campaign manager Faiz Shakir told Huffington Post. â€˜And she has remained a steady and consistent ally, supporter, surrogate and adviser to the senator ever since.â€™ A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez denied there was any lingering tension between the congresswoman and Sanders. â€˜The plan was always that she would slow down her surrogate work in February, after Iowa, to focus on her re-elect and congressional duties,â€™ Lauren Hitt said. Reports, however, indicate that there was friction between Ocasio-Cortez and the campaign starting in late January. During a rally in Ames, Iowa, on January 25, Ocasio-Cortez did not mention the senatorâ€™s name - an omission noticed by Fox News. At the rally, Ocasio-Cortez also encouraged people to warn others whenever immigration authorities were in their communities looking for undocumented immigrants. According to Vanity Fair, Shakir expressed his dissatisfaction with Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s remarks about helping others avoid immigration authorities. While the Sanders campaign supports providing a path of citizenship for those who are undocumented in the United States, it has been working to shed the impression that it is encouraging non-cooperation with federal authorities. The campaign denied the Vanity Fair report that Shakir admonished Ocasio-Cortez over her remarks. Two days prior to the event in Ames, Sanders ignited controversy among progressives and liberals when his campaign promoted a friendly interview he gave to Rogan. Sanders had recently appeared on Roganâ€™s popular podcast, Joe Rogan Experience. The episode was one of Roganâ€™s most listened to and watched. When Rogan mentioned in a later podcast that he would probably vote for Sanders, the senatorâ€™s campaign tweeted the comment. This angered a large number of progressives who noted that Rogan has made comments in the past viewed as transphobic and racist. While Rogan has expressed political views that are mostly liberal, others have faulted him for inviting far-right figures onto his podcast, including Alex Jones, Stefan Molyneux, Proud Boys founder Gavin McGinnes, and actor Roseanne Barr. The Sanders campaign tried to portray Roganâ€™s comments as proof that the Vermont senator can widen his appeal to those who may not be inclined to vote for Democrats. After the Rogan controversy and the Ames speech, Ocasio-Cortez did not make an appearance on Sandersâ€™ behalf for another 16 days."
61,'Unicorn' puppy born with one ear after mishap at birth is a social media star racking up 4 million views on TikTok,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114351/Unicorn-puppy-one-ear-sticking-head-mishap-birth-social-media-star.html,"A â€˜unicornâ€™ puppy who was born with one ear that is placed near its forehead is the latest social media star, attracting millions of views on TikTok. Rae - â€˜earâ€™ spelled backwards - is a golden retriever who was disfigured after falling critically ill just after being born. After being treated at a veterinary hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was adopted by a receptionist who worked there, Brianna Voorhees. 'I lost my precious golden retriever Loki to lymphoma last year at 4 years old, so I had a heart for golden retrievers to begin with,' Vorhees told CNN. â€˜Breeders surrender (puppies) to vet techs often if they can't take care of them full-time. â€˜I said if a golden retriever ever comes in, I'm going to want to take care of it and raise it. â€˜When they found out she'd need 24-hour care, I have a heart for golden retrievers, and I just knew that she was meant for me, essentially.â€™ The breeder believes that Raeâ€™s deformity was a result of his mother cleaning off the placenta or amniotic sack too aggressively. Raeâ€™s entire ear was gone, save for the canal with all of the skin peeled off. The dog was rushed to hospital for surgery hours after being born. It was uncertain if the animal would survive. â€˜She was really in a fragile state, we didn't know if she was even going to survive beyond 48 hours,â€™ Vorhees told CNN. After round-the-clock care, she managed to make a full recovery. Rae was left with one ear that sticks out of her head. â€˜We're assuming because of the sutures is why the ear migrated to the top of her head,â€™ Vorhees said. â€˜I think as her skin grew, and she started to grow, that it just kind of migrated up there.â€™ Samantha Smith, a veterinary technician at Family Friends Veterinary Hospital, posted video of Rae on TikTok. The dog became a viral sensation. One video from TikTok has been viewed 3.8 million times. Rae, who is just 12 weeks old, is doing fine. Voorhees said she can hear normally and is not in pain. â€˜She can hear and plays in day care here at work almost every day,â€™ Vorhees said. â€˜She has best friends and is the most confident puppy ever. She's a normal puppy, just with one ear.â€™ Voorhees credited Rae with reducing stress and providing inspiration. â€˜She was a positive outlet for me,â€™ Vorhees said. â€˜I was going through a terrible time with a lot of transitions in my life personally, and Rae was a very positive distraction from a lot of things that were taking place in my life. â€˜She's actually the one who saved me. â€˜I could focus on her to take care of her to love and get love back, and she was that for me, and kind of that's why she means so much to me.â€™ Voorhees said that she lost her dog when she was pregnant with her now-two-year-old son. Sheâ€™s happy her son can now grow up with Rae."
62,Have doctors found a drug to fight coronavirus? Two experts reveal how experimentalÂ  drug remdesivir saved one woman who was in critical condition and helped 14 infected Diamond Princess passengersÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113093/Two-experts-reveal-experimental-drug-helped-SAVE-American-coronavirus-patients.html,"Two top doctors believe an experimental drug has helped save the lives of American coronavirus patients George Thompson, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California Davis Medical Center, was part of the team that administered the drug, remdesivir, to a sickly American woman who tested positive for the virus on February 26. 'We thought they were going to pass away,' Thompson told Science magazine Friday about the patient - who was the first known 'community spread' case in the United States. However, 36 hours after the woman was admitted to hospital, doctors decided to treat her with remdesivir, which is administered by intravenous drip and 'cripples an enzyme named RNA polymerase - used by many viruses to copy themselves'. Because the patient was in critical condition, the doctors were able to get 'compassionate use permission' from the FDA to test remsdesivir outside a clinical trial setting. Within a day, the woman saw a drop in her 'viral load' and her condition began to improve. Thomson did not reveal whether the patient has been discharged from the hospital due to privacy concerns, but stated that she is 'doing well'. Similarly, remsdesivir helped 14 Americans who tested positive for coronavirus after they traveled on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Richard Childs, an assistant surgeon general and lung specialist at the National Institutes of Health, told The Wall Street Journal Friday that the patients were treated with the experimental drug in a Japanese hospital. Childs described the patients as 'critically ill people and their average age is 75'. 'Many of them were probably going to die in a short amount of time, and two weeks later nobody has died and more than half of them have recovered.It's just absolutely amazing,' he remarked. However, both doctors concede that more testing needs to be done in regards to remsdesivir. Thompson says the drug could cause liver toxicity in certain patients, and says other companies have also been coming forward with experimental drugs that could be effective. Meanwhile, Childs says of remsdesivir: 'It's going to take us a while to figure out what the impact of the drug has been'. However, a 'randomized, controlled clinical trial' to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with coronavirus has begun at the University of Nebraska, according to the National Institutes of Health."
63,Celebrity make-up artist reveals the best false lash styles to suit your eye shape - from hooded lids to deep-set peepers,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8090963/Celebrity-make-artist-reveals-best-false-lash-styles-suit-eye-shape.html,"An eyelash extension expert dubbed 'the best in the business' by beauty editors has revealed the seven most common eye shapes - and how best to style them with individual falsies. Make-up artist Edy London, whose famous fans include Ellie Goulding, Mel B, Vanessa White, Lisa Snowdon and Trinny Woodall,has worked with some of the world's top beauty brands. She's represented Maybelline at London Fashion Week, styled numerous shoots for the likes of Essie and NYX, and had her work published in magazines including Tatler, Vanity Fair and Vogue ES. Her experience as a make-up artist has enabled her to identify and understand individual eye shapes and create tailored lash extensions to suit her clients' looks. Here she shares with FEMAIL the common mistakes people make when applying eye make-up and lashes, and which style to go for to best flatter your peepers. MONOLIDS You know you have monolids like actress Lucy Lui if have no crease in your eye or a less obvious crease. These are very common in people of Asian descent. I usually recommend a gentle curl and longer lashes to be applied at the outer corner. Most women with monolids have a high set brow, so a little bit of a length won't hurt to fill in the space between the lash line and the brow.  ROUND EYES Round eyes are very feminine; they are usually quite large. Study your eyes to see if you can see any white all around your iris. For these I recommend very subtle-looking lashes with a light and wispy texture, using a variety of thicknesses and curl. I'd aim for a shorter lash in the inner and outer corner, with the longest lashes in line with the highest point of the eyebrow. ALMOND EYES Almond eyes are one of my favourite shapes to work on; they are slightly pointed towards the end of the eye, with a wider centre. The iris is slightly hidden by the lower and upper eyelid. They are usually wider in width. In terms of eyelashes, the sky's the limit. On an eye shape like this, almost everything looks good. I am willing to go quite dramatic on the outer corners; I recommend using smokey liner on a lower eyelid to emphasise your shape. DOWNTURNED EYES Downturned eyes feature a downward tilt at the outer corners.It makes your upper lid look much larger, which creates more space between the brow and outside corner. With this shape we need something to give them a lift; I recommend a dense lash line with cat eye shape eyelashes. Avoid creating too much of a flick at the end; this would most likely weigh down the lid even more, creating a sad eye - which we definitely don't want! UPTURNED EYES Upturned eyes,often described as a 'cat eye', are as common as almond shaped eyes - in fact they are very similar, as they too are oval in shape and usually the lower lid appears longer. This type of eye shape suits any lash extensions - in particular a gentle B curl (a smaller curl that is very natural) with similar length eyelashes all the way across, apart from the inside corners, which need to be much shorter. The fact that the eye is already upturned means you don't need to play around with the length too much, as it will naturally give a subtle cat eye look,. If you want to exaggerate the natural eye shape, you can add a few longer lashes at the end. DEEP-SET EYES Deep-set eyes are set deeper in the eye socket which creates the illusion of a more prominent bone brow. Many people with this eye shape want to find ways to brighten up their eyes and bring them out. Deep-set eyes are the only shape that require extra length - mainly for the eyelashes to be more visible, as part of the eyelash is concealed by the depth of the socket. The curl needs to be very subtle, as often C or D curls (a large, dramatic curl) can look uncomfortable and unnatural on deep-set eyes. I usually recommend a J curl (a long, curly natural lash) or a B curl in order to look nice and in proportion; anything curlier than this may end up touching your brow bone. HOODED EYES You know you have hooded eyes when you have an extra layer of a skin that droops over the crease. Sometimes it can make you look tired - even after eight hours' sleep! It is a very beautiful shape if you have naturally long lashes, but hooded eyes are very tricky to style with cosmetics because they make even big eyes look smaller than they are. I am very critical about them because it's my eye shape, and even though I'm a make-up artist, I struggled with it until I found extensions (the fact that I naturally have very short lashes didn't help). Eye-liner never used to show up, while smoky eyes never worked quite right. Extensions are the one thing I found can rescue the situation; if you have a hooded shape I recommend them to make your eyes pop. I've even talked some of my clients out of having a Blepharoplasty - surgery to remove the extra layer of skin in your eyes - and encouraged them to get lash extensions instead. I recommend medium length, and a C curl (a natural curl that's bigger than a B curl) to go over and cover the lid. I personally like mine longest underneath the highest point of my eyebrow. Edy told Femail how her passion for individual eyelash extensions was born out of frustration towards the strip lashes and mascaras on the market. 'Having to work on big shoots with absolutely stunning models who weren't blessed with long eyelashes, I quickly realised that no mascara was good enough to extend and thicken long lashes,' she said. 'Very often, even the best quality mascara would smudge or look clumpy in various weather conditions. I was also getting fed up with false eyelashes, which are not suitable for some eye shapes. Often they are too long on the lash line, or can make round eyes look sad or droopy. 'My eyelash extensions last between three and six weeks based on how well they are maintained and combined with the natural speed of eyelash growth.' Edy prides herself on providing her clients with longer, fuller, natural-looking lashes. She appliesindividual eyelash extensions using the '1 Lash per 1 Lash' technique. 'This is the safest option and makes the lashes feel weightless if they are chosen and applied properly,' she said. Here she shares her top tips for getting the right extensions for you...  GET A GOOD TECHNICIAN - AND AVOID RUSSIAN LASHES For ladies who are looking for a lash technician, always go with a good recommendation. It is worth investing time in research to make sure your eyelashes and eyes stay safe. Try to avoid volume lashes (often called Russian lashes) unless it is a one-off treat for a party.They don't look natural. 3D eyelash extensions will triple the number of your natural lashes - and let's be honest, no one has 450 lashes per eye. Plus, your natural lashes can't carry on having them done continuously without causing damage. They will look too heavy and too obvious and the natural beauty of your eye will get lost behind a big black fan. They are also very often poorly applied; when they first come into contact with water, they tend to clump until they fall out.  KEEP IT NATURAL Eyes are our most beautiful and noticeable feature.Working on somebody's eyelashes, I focus on keeping them the centre of attention, not the eyelashes. Sadly with some falsies, we see a woman's eyelashes before we even see her face. Eyelashes are there to enhance the natural beauty of the eyes by opening them up, framing them, enhancing their colour or fixing imperfections. False lashes should usually be no longer than2-3mm from the natural eyelash to make sure they're not obvious and remain in good condition. Always go for thin, fine-looking lashes; I recommend no thicker than 0.10mm per lash. These will ensure they're lighter and more comfortable, and it will be less obvious to see where they join the natural lash. ADD COLOUR NOT LENGTH FOR A DRAMATIC LOOK Colour lashes are designed to enhance your natural eye colour in a much more subtle way than coloured mascara, as you can place a few here and there. There are couple of ways to enhance your eye colour. You can go for the same colour of your eyes in a darker shade - for example, I often offer my blue-eyed clients a couple of navy eyelashes just above the iris to bring out the blueness of their eye, especially in the sunshine as it looks incredible. Or you can play with contrast. For example, if you have green eyes, they will look more intense with a few purple lashes thrown in. Iwould ONLY advise trying out colour eyelashes when using the very best technicians as it requires a very precise application and a lot of creativity. AVOID TOUCHING YOUR FALSE LASHES In order to make your eyelashes last longer, remember not to tug at them while applying make-up. Try to avoid rubbing or picking your eyes, as in the long term it can cause lash loss. Do not pull them out! This is the most common reason for lash damage. Avoid using alcohol-based products around your eyes as they are usually drying. Finally, only use products designed for eyes; you can use a sponge, but aim for one without coarse fibres which could tangle with your lashes and pull out extensions."
64,Ghost ship of the sky! B2 Stealth Bomber from the US is pictured at RAF Fairford after carrying out training missions in Europe,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8114481/B2-Stealth-Bomber-pictured-RAF-Fairford.html,"Spanning an imposing 170 feet and capable of unleashing awesome destruction, the B2 stealth bomber is one of the most deadly weapons in the United States' military arsenal. But this weekend it was on full display to Britons at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire after flying in from the American base in Lajes Field, Portugal, where it had carried out training. These exercises over Garvi Island were choreographed to showcase Washington's military might by striking fear into its enemies while reassuring its allies. And to those who marvelled at the stealth bomber in the Cotswolds, it certainly had the desired effect and sent a chill up the spine. Darren Lewington, 49, flew over the RAF base yesterday in atwo-seater Piper Cub to glimpse the best view of the gigantic plane. The aeronautical enthusiast said: 'Apparently there were three of them, they tend to be deployed every few months or so. 'There's something a bit sinister about those planes, it looks like something Batman would swoop around in.' Three stealth bombers swooped into Fairford on Thursday and were greeted by jaw-dropped locals who watched in amazement. According to a US Air Force statement release, the B2 Spirit aircraft - which are capable of carrying either conventional or nuclear warheads - conducted military drills with US NATO partners in Europe to 'deter adversaries' and reassure 'allies'. Lt. Gen Steven Basham, Deputy Commander of US Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa, said: 'Operating bombers from forward locations enables collective defense capabilities and provides the US and NATO the strategic and operational capacity needed to deter adversaries while assuring our allies and partners'. Previously the B-2 stealth bombers - developed under the Advanced Technology Bomber during Jimmy Carter's administration - were based in Portugal. NATO, founded in 1949 to deter the expansionist USSR, has come under strain in recent years as member-states are accused of reneging treaty duties. President Donald Trump, who famously designated the alliance 'obsolete', put European allies under pressure to spend two per cent of their GDP on defence. Military drills in NATO airspace come amid heightened tensions with Russia, which is accused by Western powers of bullying and aggressive behaviour. Relations between Moscow and Western powers first soured after the former's war with Georgia in 2008, backing separatists in the tiny Caucasian state. They collapsed after Russia annexed Crimea and helped fuel Ukraine's bloody civil war, which began after the toppling of the pro-Moscow regime in 2014. Russia has also found itself at loggerheads with the US, Britain, and France in Syria, where it has backed Bashar al-Assad and Iran to the hilt since 2015. President Vladimir Putin has lamented the collapse of the USSR, and accused NATO of provoking Russia by expanding the alliance after the Cold War. "
65,The professor digging for life on Mars - from a desk 140 million miles away in England,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113237/The-Oxford-University-professor-digging-life-Mars-140-million-miles-away-Oxford.html,"The distance between Professor Scott McLennan's desk at Oxford University and Mars is about 140 million miles, but it doesn't stop him using his computer to direct Nasa's latest spacecraft on the Red Planet's surface. He is a member of a team that controls the car-sized vehicle, named Curiosity, as they try to discover if Mars once had the right conditions to support life. Each member has a different area of expertise, such as geology or atmospheric science, or responsibility for the rover's cameras and instruments. Prof McLennan says: 'Every day Curiosity sends information back to Earth. That determines what we do and where we go next. To make anything happen, we have to give it meticulously planned instructions.' Curiosity has sent home thousands of images of unprecedented clarity of the surface of Mars to help provide information to create a detailed picture of the planet's past, when it was much warmer and had rushing rivers and deep lakes. Thanks to experts such as Prof McLennan, Curiosity has collected and analysed rock samples in its on-board lab, suggesting that there may have been life on Mars three billion years ago. So far, the evidence is inconclusive. But, says Prof McLennan, with Nasa's next Mars mission due to launch in July, this may change. Curiosity, which is 10ft tall and 9ft wide, was launched in November 2011, reaching Mars nine months later. Its descent was carefully slowed by retro-rockets and a supersonic parachute. Landing at the bottom of the 100-mile-wide Gale Crater, it was designed to work for a minimum of a Martian year â€“ about 687 days â€“ but is still functioning. It has a 7ft robotic arm, weighs about a ton and its power supply comes from a slug of plutonium. Prof McLennan, 67, says Gale Crater is now arid but there is 'evidence this was once a huge freshwater lake, which may have been hundreds of feet deep. Rivers tumbled down the crater walls and formed deltas when they reached the lake's edge.' Although midday temperatures there now sometimes rise only just above freezing, at night they plunge to minus 70C. But three billion years ago, 'the climate may have been a bit like an English winter,' says Prof McLennan. So far, Curiosity has travelled 13 miles across the surface of the planet and climbed more than 1,400ft up the side of a mountain. Most impressively, last week it navigated a 30-degree gully between crags to reach the top of the escarpment. With its flat top above a line of vertical cliffs, to the untrained eye it looks like a Peak District moorland edge. Curiosity's next task, which it may accomplish this week, is to drill down and take a sample of powder from a rock slab. This will be dropped through a port into the rover, where tools will analyse the rock by heating it to more than 1,000C. It was these techniques that led to the discovery of organic carbon compounds that could be evidence of primitive life. However, Mars scientists often repeat a comment by the late astronomer Carl Sagan that 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence' â€“ which is why no one is shouting that they have proof of life just yet. Nevertheless, Prof McLennan says the next mission, Mars 2020, has been tailored by the attempt to find it. The new rover, Perseverance, is planned to land next year in a crater called Jezero. He hopes that after two further missions, samples will be sent back to Earth and provide scientists with something that has so far been unattainable â€“ examples of Martian sedimentary rock to analyse here, where tools such as electron microscopes might reveal fossils of single-celled organisms. Whatever the outcome, Prof McLennan is sure it will be worth the wait: 'All of us involved consider it an absolute privilege. Some days you get lost in the detail. 'And then you step back and you simply marvel that you're seeing something amazing that's never been seen before. 'If that doesn't move you, nothing in science ever will.'"
66,Child catches coronavirus after getting an autograph from infected NBA star Rudy Gobert - but health officials claim the cases are NOT linked,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8113269/Child-gets-coronavirus-receiving-autograph-NBA-star-tested-positive-virus.html,"A youngster from Rhode Island has tested positive for coronavirus after meeting Frenchman Rudy Gobert, the first NBA player known to have tested positive for the virus. Two children,a second-grader and a pre-schooler from the town ofWesterly,have contracted COVID-19. One of them received an autograph from the player in Boston a week earlier. Gobert ended up signing an autograph for the kid when the Utah Jazz were playing against the Boston Celtics on March 6. State health officials say there is no link between the two cases. 'TD Garden and Boston Celtics have talked with health officials who assured us that based on the affected players' health statuses, it is highly unlikely that anyone from the Celtics team came into contact with them while they were contagious,' the arena said in a statement. 'Furthermore, the risk is low for guests, players and associates who were at the Celtics game on Friday, March 6 and events thereafter.'  Westerly Police chief Shawn Lacey told the Providence Journalthat schools in the town will be closed next week after the two students who go to the same elementary school tested positive. Students and staff at the Springbrook Elementary School are now on a two-week quarantine. Gobert on Monday joked about the NBA's policy to keep media members at a safe distance from players in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. He touched all the microphones and other recording equipment at the press table after concluding interviews with the media in a room at the Jazz's press facility. After Jazz teammate Donovan Mitchell confirmed Thursday over social media that he tested positive for coronavirus, Gobert issued an apology on Instagram. 'I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of concern and support over the last 24 hours. I have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis ... mostly fear, anxiety and embarrassment,' Gobert wrote. 'The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered. At the time, I had no idea I was even infected. I was careless and make no excuse. I hope my story serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously. I will do whatever I can to support using my experience as way to educate others and prevent the spread of this virus. I am under great care and will fully recover. Thank you again for all your support. I encourage everyone to take all of the steps to stay safe and healthy. Love.' The NBA suspended the regular season late Wednesday after Gobert's positive result. Since his foolhardy actions, Gobert has attempted to make amends, pledging $200,000 to part-time employees at the arena that plays host to Jazz games to help cover their lost wages. The new virus, called COVID-19,is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms including a sore throat, headache, fever, cough or trouble breathing. Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure. He also pledged $100,000 each to assist families affected by the pandemic in Oklahoma City, where he was when the diagnosis came, and Utah. He also is giving 100,000 Euros ($111,450 USD) to relief efforts in France, earmarking that for childcare assistance to health care workers as well as for caregivers to the elderly. 'I am humbled by the tireless efforts and care of people around the globe for those affected by COVID-19, especially my own communities of Utah and France, in addition to my appreciation for the state of Oklahoma and my care there, and of course, my Utah Jazz family,' Gobert said in a release distributed by the Jazz. 'I know there are countless ways that people have been impacted,' Gobert continued. 'These donations are a small token that reflect my appreciation and support for all those impacted and are the first of many steps I will take to try and make a positive difference, while continuing to learn more about COVID-19 and educate others.'"
67,Five total strangers and the shocking scandal that would bond them for life: How a Dutch fertility expert fathered 61 children with his own patients without their knowledge,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-8078267/Five-total-strangers-shocking-scandal-bond-life.html,"Joey Hoofdman still gets goosebumps when he describes the moment he saw a pictureof his biological father for the first time. The resemblance was striking and undeniable. The slightly aquiline nose, the straight-set eyebrows and the curve of his jaw â€“ even the fall of his tousled blond hair was so familiar it was like looking into a mirror. It came as little surprise: Joey had spenthis unhappy childhood convinced that he could not be related to his volatile parents, a torment that almost drove him to suicide. But finding his biological father was not, as he might have hoped, a joyful moment of discovery.In fact, the truth was far more troubling. The man staring back at him from the screen on his phone was Jan Karbaat, a Dutch fertility doctor who had successfully helped Joeyâ€™s mother conceive. It meant he had inseminated her with his own sperm instead of her husbandâ€™s as they had agreed. And Joeyâ€™s mother had no idea. It thrust Joey into the centre of one of Europeâ€™s biggest medical scandals. The trusted doctor had, without his patientsâ€™ knowledge or consent, been using his own sperm to inseminate the women who came to him desperate for a child. At the time of his death in 2017, he was thought to havehad 22 recognised children from several marriages, and was suspected of secretly fathering 22 more with his patients â€“ without their permission. Now, three years on, there are at least 61 known offspring conceived in this way, and it is feared he may have fathered hundreds more over a period of nearly 40 years. After finding Karbaatâ€™s photograph on the internet, Joey,33, was left in no doubt that he was one of them. â€˜When I tell this story I still get an electric shock through my body,â€™ he says today. â€˜Iâ€™d been so sure my father was not my real father, and this picture meant I wasnâ€™t losing my mind. I sent it to my friends and asked them who it was, and they all replied, â€œItâ€™s you, Joeyâ€. â€˜But what it meant was more complicated. Something like this had never crossed my mind.â€™ For Joey, and the 60 other confirmed children, the extent of the scandal is only now becoming clear. It has consumed the Rotterdam suburb of Barendrecht, where Karbaat ran his private clinic from 1980 until it was shut down by the Dutch government in 2009 amid reports of record-keeping irregularities. The quaint suburb, with a population of around 48,000, is surrounded by green fields, windmills and the meandering banks of the Oude Maas river. But Karbaatâ€™s misconduct has left many residents questioning if they might be related, with concerned husbands and wives carrying out hasty DNA tests. He also distributed vials of semen to clinics in the US, Belgium Germany and Denmark. Could they also have been his own? At the centre of the scandal, of course, are children like Joey, the legacy Karbaat has left in his wake. The half-siblings communicate on WhatsApp, new members joining all the time. Some say Karbaatâ€™s actions have overshadowed their entire lives; others that he has done them no harm. Joey now has at least 60 half-siblings â€“ ironic given that, as a child, a supportive family is exactly what he lacked. His earliest memory growing up in Rotterdam with an elder brother and younger sister is of his parents fighting. â€˜I wished I was not from my family and imagined being someone elseâ€™s child,â€™ he said. He left home at 15, and when his legal father died in 2012, the unanswered questions about his parentage were brought into sharper focus. He became depressed and sought help from a psychiatrist, who urged him to speak to his mother. It was early 2017 when he finally worked up the courage to do so. Shocked by his questions, his mother admitted visiting Karbaatâ€™s clinic but insisted she had seen the vial with his fatherâ€™s name on it before she was inseminated. â€˜She was shocked and angry. She wouldnâ€™t talk to me. She thought I was implying she had been unfaithful.â€™ Joey retreated to his car and Googled Karbaatâ€™s name. There was a picture of the doctor in his younger years â€“ and detailsof rumours that the doctor had used his own sperm. â€˜It was horrible, shocking. I didnâ€™t know what to think.â€™ Joey got in touch with a Facebook group run by a woman who suspected she was also one of Karbaatâ€™s children. She put him in touch with a private investigator, who gave Joey a setof DNA tests. He persuaded his siblings, and his fatherâ€™s two children from his first marriage, to take swabs. The results were explosive. Joey was not related to his fatherâ€™s eldest two children, which meant he could only have been conceived with an unknown donorâ€™s sperm. Not only that: his elder brother had been fathered by a different donor. Only Joeyâ€™s sister was revealed to be fully related to their parents. â€˜I went to visit Karbaatâ€™s house, full of questions. I spoke tohis wife who kept telling me to ask my mum, to come back later and the doctor would give me a tour of the clinic. â€˜Karbaat was, at the time, desperately ill. She knew that and didnâ€™t mention it. A week later he died.â€™ The only way to get answers was to track down others wanting them, too. Joey attended a court hearing in which a small group was trying to force Karbaatâ€™s family to release DNA evidence that would allow them to carry out tests to confirm that the doctor was their father. At the hearing he met Moniek Wassenaar. There was an easy familiarity between the two, which only deepened when they returned to her Amsterdam home. â€˜I thought, â€œ[The dÃ©cor is] the same style Iâ€™d use in my own house.â€ We decided to see if we were related and did a test. Two days later the resultswere back â€“ we were half-siblings. That was the first match.It was very emotional.â€™ Joey put his results on a genealogy site that matches DNA results with others around the world. Very quickly, it paired him with Inge Herlaar, 39, an HR professional and mother of two who had grown up in Barendrecht. Inge had been curious about her heritage since, aged 25, her father had confessed that she and her brother had been conceived using a sperm donor. â€˜My father was caring and nice, the kind of father you wish everyone could have,â€™ Inge recalls. â€˜There was no doubt that he was still my father. But I was curious. I liked the idea my biological father could be Jon Bon Jovi.â€™ A week after sending her DNA to the genealogy site in June 2017, Inge received a call from Joey. â€˜He said, â€œI think Iâ€™m your half-brother.â€ I was really stunned. We met two weeks later with three others, who I found out were all my half-siblings. â€˜We were searching for the same features, the same life events. One of them, Marsha, was just so similar to me â€“ Iâ€™ve since found out we share so many genes that our mothers must be somehow connected, too.â€™ While Inge was shocked about her link to the notorious case, she insists that Karbaat â€˜doesnâ€™t really appeal to meâ€™. â€˜If you think Jon Bon Jovi could be your father and it turns out to be Karbaat, thatâ€™s a little disappointing,â€™ she jokes. â€˜ButI donâ€™t feel a connection with him. I have a father already, who raised me and loved me.â€™ Still, she insisted her American husband Wim, 61, take aDNA test to prove they werenâ€™t related. She will also insist her sons test their partners before they have children â€“ just in case. â€˜Before this happened I thought nurture was more important than nature, that we are all a product of the way we are raised. But meeting Marsha, and all of the others, makes me realise youâ€™ll never change that blueprint. Many of the Karbaat children are doctors or health professionals. Itâ€™s strange.â€™ A court decision in early 2019 finally allowed Karbaatâ€™s DNA to be released for testing, which means more siblings keep joining the group. â€˜When I saw it written down, I broke,â€™ Joey admits. â€˜It was very emotional, almost too much to process. Now Iâ€™m no longer angry but I am curious. I have the puzzle in my head but I canâ€™t put the pieces together.â€™ Both Inge and Joey worry they may have inherited Karbaatâ€™s personality traits. Inge explained: â€˜In HR, we often have to make decisions to let people go, and I worry if Iâ€™ve made the right decision. So I always try to discuss it with colleagues. Karbaat didnâ€™t do the right thing so I have to try.â€™ â€˜At first I was asking my friends to tell me if I was being manipulative,â€™ Joey recalls. â€˜I wanted to know if I was doing things, tricking people, in a way I wasnâ€™t aware of. To have a more human understanding of him as a person would be helpful.â€™ Most of Karbaatâ€™s legal family â€“ except one son who provided some DNA â€“ have refused to help the group. Joey said: â€˜We heard from the Karbaat familyâ€™s lawyer that he has put in his will that if family members decide to cooperate with us they would not get any money from his estate. He is blocking it, taking his secrets to the grave. â€˜It is cruel. He told a newspaper weeks before he died that there were no children, that we were seeing ghosts. He was still denying it until the end.â€™ The impact on their mothers has been no less stressful. Joeyâ€™s mother, who learned her three children have three different fathers, has struggled hard to come to terms with the news. Inge says it has been â€˜terribleâ€™ for her mother. â€˜Itâ€™s such an intimate thing to do to someone,â€™ she adds. The extended family is still learning how to function. It is â€˜a lot of workâ€™ to keep in touch with them all and every new member needs support. Not all of them get along, Inge confides, â€˜like any family, in a way. On the other hand, youâ€™re well connected. If I have a problem, I have a lawyer. There are several doctors. If something pops up I can call a sister or a brother. Itâ€™s really funny â€“ and very convenient.â€™ None of Karbaatâ€™s children will ever be able to confront their biological father to ask why. â€˜I only have the information from the media,â€™ explains Joey. â€˜Maybe he did it because of the money, maybe he had a God complex. Thatâ€™s what everyone says. But I think, at the start, he just wanted to help mothers to have children. Later, he evolved and it became about needing money or the status.â€™ The sad reality is that Joey and hishalf-siblings will never get the answers from him. The next step is a class action in Hollandâ€™s civil courts where 53 people â€“ including children of Karbaat, others conceived at his clinic and former patients â€“ are claiming damages against Karbaatâ€™s estate. They will return to court, hopefully for a final time, to hear the verdict within the next few weeks. Joey hopes to reclaim the money he has spent on DNA tests, and compensation for the damage done to his mother. But not all have joined the action. Some, like Inge, are just happy to have found connections with their half-siblings. â€˜I cannot help that he is my father, and his legitimate children also cannot help that he is their father,â€™ she shrugs. Last month, Joey and Inge visited Karbaatâ€™s grave in Rotterdam. â€˜It was the closest I could get to him,â€™ Joey says. â€˜To tell him everything and to forgive him. That was the most important thing so I could have peace of mind. Iâ€™m still not responsible for his wrongdoings and his actions butI need to forgive him to move on. I deserve that.â€™ The Immaculate Deception will be available weekly on Apple, Spotify and all podcast providers from 18 March "
68,"British-Iranian prisoner reveals coronavirus chaos inside Iran's prisons despite 54,000 being released to stop the spread",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8111783/British-Iranian-prisoner-reveals-coronavirus-chaos-inside-Irans-prisons.html,"A British-Iranian prisoner has revealed how soldiers are wearing worn out masks and no gloves as the Iranian prison system collapses into coronavirus chaos. Anoosheh Ashoori, who is being held in Tehran on spying charges, also said no one checked his temperature when he was moved to a bedbug riddled ward in Evin prison without explanation. A second prisoner has said guards are standing too far away from prisoners to do a headcount and forcing them to buy their own hand sanitiser - making it unavailable for most. There are fears of a massive outbreak in the Iranian prison system as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is also being held in the notorious jail, displayed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but was not tested. She is said to be 'improving'. The Iranian authorities have said they will release 54,000 prisoners who test negative for the virus in an attempt to alleviate the pressure. Iran has imposed a nationwide lock down today after more than 500 people died of the virus and at least 11,000 were found to be infected, although the actual number is thought to be much higher. Speaking in a recorded phone call to his family reported by The Guardian, Mr Ashoori said: 'It is chaos and I cannot explain how bad this situation is. '(The guards) touched all our stuff when we entered. 'Last night bedbugs were biting everyone. Nobody slept through the night. Today we have newcomers who are murderers and all different outlaws.Someone was sent for coronavirus quarantine.' In a phone call from Evin prison on Thursday, a second prisoner - who has not been named - said: 'The situation here is really that we're all ill, we are all having dry cough. We have fever. 'There is no test for coronavirus or any test kits available. All we can do is try to reach the clinic by pushing and shoving. And once there, the guards tell us there is no doctor or that the doctor is not coming, return to your ward or we will use force. 'If by chance, we happen to find a doctor, all they do is to aim their digital thermometer at us, without even approaching us. 'A number of inmates who contracted coronavirus were transferred to Massih Daneshvari hospital and never came back. 'Prisoners (with money) can afford to buy disinfectants for themselves from outside the prison but, others like us, are without that kind of money and we cannot even buy alcohol to clean our hands. 'The guards do not dare approach us for the head count. They address us from a distance while wearing mask and gloves. 'They do not touch our ball-point pens. 'When they want to take us to court, they use vapour disinfectants to clean us and use disinfectant gel and spray. And they do not permit us to touch the court's pens or stamps.' The prisoner also said they fear that Iran is using the outbreak to 'liquidate' those it is holding. Both inmates made urgent calls for international investigators to visit the cells and see the conditions they are being kept in. Official figures suggest that six prisoners are infected with coronavirus in Evin prison and one, in ward four, has died. The actual number is thought to be much higher. Iran has insisted its prisons are clean and that 'necessary' tests are being completed and that it has responded to the crisis through its release programme. Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is waiting for his wife to be released from prison in the outbreak. She was taken to see a doctor last week but was not tested for coronavirus, according to the Free Nazanin campaign. '(The doctor) confirmed to her that her symptoms were clearly a virus and were consistent with coronavirus but he also confessed he was unable to test her with a testing kit,' they said in a statement. 'The doctor, however, did reassure Nazanin that since her symptoms had stabilised it was likely a positive sign that she was hopefully soon going to start to recover.' She was arrested at Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport in April 2016 while travelling with her daughter and jailed on spying charges for five years. Iran is one of the country's worst hit by the outbreak. Satellite images have revealed mass graves being constructed in the city of Qom, suggesting a major epidemic. Members of the Iranian parliament, a former diplomat and a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have died. In response, the judiciary have said they will release 54,000 prisoners who have tested negative for the virus. But, as test kits remain hard to come by, it is not clear how they will establish this. In a statement on March 4 they said those released would include 'security prisoners' who had been jailed for more than five years."
69,"Shot nine times, forced to 'play dead' and left buried under bodies: On the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosque massacre, three brave survivors describe how they've learned to live with their scars",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8103073/Christchurch-mosque-shooting-survivors-speak-one-year-tragedy.html,"The survivors of the Christchurch terror attack have opened up about the horrific mass shooting and revealed what life has been like one year on. On March 15, 2019, Brenton Tarrant allegedly stormed two mosques in Christchurch, on New Zealand's south Island, killing 51 Muslim worshipers. For those who miraculously survived the attack, which is the deadliestmodern-day mass shooting the country has seen, the past 12 months have been a struggle. The traumatic event has turned Temel Atacocugu's life completely upside down. He has spent much of the past year in hospital after he was shot nine times. The first bullet smashed into his teeth,four more went into both his legs. As he lay motionless on the ground he was hit four more timein his left arm and leg. His physical recovery has beenremarkable. While his scars still remain, he no longer needs a wheelchair or a cane to move. It is his mental recovery which is taking longer. He is still haunted by the images. He has been on antidepressants for a year, he expects he will be on them for another 12 months. 'Pretty much my whole life is upside down and changed,' he said. 'But spiritually, in a religious way, I'm much stronger than I used to be.' Working at the kebab shop he co-owns has been a struggle since the attack, people often ask about his injuries, which makes MrAtacocugu uncomfortable. He now prefers working alone and is considering going back to work as a painter instead. For Mustafa Boztas, the attack has prompted changes in his career and how he wants to live his life. The 22-year-old was praying when the gunman stormed the Al Noor mosque and opened fire. He was part of a group that tried to break a window to escape but the gunman was too quick. 'Then we all got shot,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Boztas was shot in the leg. Injured and bloody, he lay motionless in a pile of bodies pretending to be dead. After a few minutes the room went quiet - the shooter left. The former University of Canterbury engineering student managed to flee out of a smashed window.However, outside was no safer. Shots continued to ring out across the city. As he lay helpless in the street waiting for paramedics to arrive, a policeman came and offered help. The harrowing moment has inspired him to change careers, he is now hoping to become a police officer himself. However, he was turned down by the New Zealand Police Force in November as he has endured significant trauma and deemedmedically unfit. He can reapply next yearafter a 'comprehensive psychological assessment'. And while March 15 was a horrific day, MrBoztas is refusing to let it destroy him. 'Life is worth living, so I want to keep living my life. I don't like to be sad; I don't want to be depressed. I'm going to work towards my dreams and those dreams will become reality one day.' Sheikh Hasan Rubel, 35, was shot twice in the pelvis and once in his leg. The accountant now has to use a walking stick and still requires more surgery to his pelvis. And while his body has been damaged, Mr Rubel says his mind was hit the hardest. 'I still remember the feeling when I was getting shot by one after one bullet ... at one point I was thinking that at any time I can get shot anywhere and IÂ´ll be dead.' For many of the victims, they have found strength in their religion. New Zealanders will commemorate those who died on the anniversary of the mass killing on Sunday. Tarrant has pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism, murder and attempted murder, and his trial is scheduled to start in June. If found guilty, he faces life imprisonment.

0,Donald Trump is to 'declare a national emergency' over coronavirus - as Brazilian leader he shook hands with at Mar-a-Lago tests positive for the diseaseÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109455/Brazilian-president-shook-Donald-Trumps-hand-POSITIVE-coronavirus.html,"President Donald Trump will hold a press conference on Friday afternoon amid confusion and chaos about the coronavirus after reportsBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who dined with him on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, tested positive for the disease but then said a second test showed a negative result. Trump, who shook hands with his Brazilian counterpart at that meal,will declare a national emergency, Bloomberg News reported, which would open the door to more federal funds for states and cities. Additionally, Trump and his fellow G7 leaders spoke, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, and will hold a videoconference on Monday about combatting the disease. 'Following my call with @realDonaldTrumpand all G7 leaders, we agreed to organize an extraordinary Leaders Summit by videoconference on Monday on Covid-19. We will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response,' Macron wrote on Twitter. The president will answer questions at the 3 p.m. presser as the House prepares to vote on a coronavirus package, the stock market tries to recover from its worst day since the 1987 economic recession, and schools across the country have closed out of fears of spreading the virus. He will likely be peppered with questions about his health, whether he should be tested, and why he hasn't intovoluntary self-quarantine, despite CDC guidelines describing someone in his situation as 'medium risk' for infection. The president announced the press conference after reports out of Brazil said the Bolsonaro tested positive for coronavirus.One of the major newspapers inRio de Janeiro,Journal O Dia, notedThe Guardian's Tom Phillips, reported the newsof Bolsonaro's positive test. Bolsonaro, 64, was checkedfor the disease after his aideFabio Wajngarten tested positive for it. But a second test that came back on Friday showed the president tested negative, according to a statement on Bolsonaro's official Facebook page, which is adding to the questions and confusion. On Thursday, Trump brushed aside concerns about his encounter with the Brazilians - the latest in a series of brushes the president has had with the highly-contagious disease. Both Bolsonaro andWajngarten, his press secretary, were at the Winter White House Saturday night.Wajngarten had his photo take with President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Trump and the first family have resisted going into self-quarantine despite other lawmakers who came into contact with those testing positive for the disease going into voluntary isolation. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommends testing if you 'have been in close contact with a person known to have' the virus. The agency defines close contact as 'being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time.' Also, according to CDC guidelines, the president would be considered 'medium' risk for exposure. Other world leaders are self-quarantining. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in a voluntary 14-day quarantine after his wife, Sophie, tested positive for the disease. Several members of the first family were at the Winter White House Saturday night where there was a birthday party for Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., in addition to the working dinner for the Brazilian delegation. One of those was Ivanka Trump, who, it was revealed late Thursday, had another brush with the disease. She and Attorney General Bill Barr posed for a photograph with Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton on March 5 - days before he tested positive for coronavirus. They were meeting as part of a meeting between officials from the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S.The next day, Ivanka Trump attended the dinner at Mar-a-Lago with her father and Bolsonaro.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health, said he would 'likely' have been tested after coming if he had come into contact with Bolsonaro's aidewho tested positive for the coronavirus. When asked hypothetically if he would get a test, he told ABC's 'Good Morning America': 'Likely I would, but I'm not sure.' 'It depends on the circumstances,' he added.  Wajngarten, theBolsonaro aide who was at Mar-a-Lago for Saturday's dinner and the birthday party, tested positive for the virus, setting off a chain of events on Thursday, including a test for his boss. Brazil has at least 73 confirmed cases of coronavirus and zero deaths thus far. The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald reported on Thursday that Bolsonaro took two tests: 'The result should be ready. But the presidential palace is now saying the result will only be released Friday, which likely means he had a second test, and that one takes longer,' he wrote on Twitter. Bolsonaro's son Eduardo, who was also at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night, tweeted on Friday that there was 'too much lies' in the media and claimed the testing wasn't complete. 'Too much lies and little information. Coronavirus exam done with the team that were with JB in USA have not yet been completed There are always those people who tell lies in the media and if the story is confirmed they say ""I told you!"", if not will be just 1 more fake news,' he wrote. Fox News' John Roberts reportedEduardo Bolsonaro originally told the network that his father tested positive. 'After telling @FoxNews that his father had a preliminary POSITIVE test for coronavirus, Eduardo Bolsonaro now tells @FoxNews the test was NEGATIVE. Bolsonaro says has been in touch with the White House,' Roberts wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Thursday he would self-quarantine and be tested for the virus. The South Carolina senator was at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. He also met with Australian official in his Washington D.C. office on March 5. 'Senator Graham was at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. He has no recollection of direct contact with the President of Brazil, who is awaiting results of a coronavirus test, or his spokesman who tested positive,' Graham's office said in a statement. 'However, in an abundance of caution and upon the advice of his doctor, Senator Graham has decided to self-quarantine awaiting the results of a coronavirus test. This is a precautionary measure. He will continue to work from home,' his office noted. Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida also said that he will self-quarantine after he met with the Brazil delegation, which included Wajngarten. 'While I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me,' Scott said. He said he was self-quarantining out of 'an abundance of caution' and would work from home. President Trump,who was photographed standing next to Wajngartenn and Vice President Mike Pence at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night, said Thursday he was 'not concerned' about possibly contracting the virus. 'Let's put it this way: I'm not concerned,' Trump told reporters Thursday while meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office. 'We did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time,' the president noted. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham addressed the situation before reports of Bolsonaro's test. 'The White House is aware of public reports that a member of the Brazilian delegation's visit to Mar-a-Lago last weekend tested positive for COVID-19; confirmatory testing is pending. Exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps. Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,' she said, referring toWajngarten. 'As stated before, the White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service has been working closely with various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the First & Second Families, and all White House staff healthy,' she noted. 'To reiterate CDC guidelines, there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine,' Grisham said.'We are monitoring the situation closely and will update everyone as we get more information.' Wajngarten accompanied his boss on the Florida visit, which included meetings with officials and the dinner at Mar-a-Lago. The encounter was the latest brush Trump has had with the coronavirus. An attendee at CPAC, the annual conservative conference that the president addressed at the end of February, tested positive for the virus. The American Conservative Union, which sponsors the conference, was quick to say the person had no direct contact with Trump or Pence, who also spoke. But three lawmakers went into self-quarantine because they did and all had contact with the president: new White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Rep. Doug Collins and Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz was also at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night for the dinner and birthday party. Additionally, the Florida Republican flew back to Washington D.C. with the president on Air Force One on Monday. The president has not been tested for the coronavirus, according to the White House. A columnist for the newspaper, Monica Bergamo, said Wajngarten was tested for coronavirus at the Albert Einstein Hospital in SÃ£o Paulo on Wednesday. His test result was positive, multiple news outlets reported. In the photo he posted on Instagram from the Saturday night events at Mar-a-Lago, Wajngarten is standing next to Trump wearing a 'Make Brazil great again' cap. Vice President Mike Pence was next to Trump. In addition to the working dinner at Mar-a-Lago, there was a birthday party for Guilfoyle, attended by several members of the first family and many Trump allies. Spotted at the lavish bash: Donald Trump Jr., her boyfriend of almost two years; Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump;Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner; Tiffany Trump; Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney; Republican Senator Lindsey Graham; and Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida. Fox News host Tucker Carlson was also there as was National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien;Senator Rand Paulâ€™s Deputy Chief of Staff Sergio Gor, Fox Newsâ€™ Jesse Watters and his wife Emma Watters; and new acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. As of Thursday afternoon, there have been more than 1,360 reported cases of coronavirus in the United States. At least 39 people have died. Last month, Trump said he was not concerned about contracting the virus after a man in his 50s who attended the three-day Conservative Political Action Conference that began on February 26. The American Conservative Union, the organization that runs CPAC, insisted the patient had no contact with either Trump or Pence at the conservative gathering in National Harbor, Maryland. 'A New Jersey hospital tested the person, and CDC confirmed the positive result,' the ACU said. 'The individual is under the care of medical professionals in the state of New Jersey, and has been quarantined.' The attendee did not listen to any speeches in the main hall, the ACU confirmed. Several senior White House officials attended the event, including White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump, White House senior counselor Jared Kushner, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway and the former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.  Donald Trump Jr was also there as were several members of the president's cabinet including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Health and Human Service Secretary Alex Azar, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to reporters that precautions were being taken although she did not offer specifics. 'The White House is aware of an individual testing positive for coronavirus after attending the CPAC conference that took place nearly two weeks ago. At this time, there is no indication that either President Trump or Vice President Pence met with or were in close proximity to the attendee. 'The president's physician and United States Secret Service have been working closely with White House staff and various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the first family and the entire White House complex safe and heathy,' she said.' Donald Trump Jr did not come into contact with the individual at CPAC, a spokesman said. 'It has been confirmed that Don did not come into contact with the individual that tested positive,' said a spokesman for the president's son told DailyMail.com. Earlier this week, aleading New York doctor and political ally of Senator Ted Cruzwent into self-quarantine over fears he has coronavirus. Alan Berger, a 55-year-old gynecologist who works for NYU Langone Health, volunteered to isolate himself and is no longer seeing patients, the facility confirmed in a statement. Berger has hosted fundraisers for Texas Republican Cruz in his hometown of Englewood, New Jersey and is said to be friendly with President Donald Trump's in laws, the Kushners. Authorities have not commented on suggestions Berger is the 'patient zero' who interacted with Cruz and Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, at CPAC. The CPAC patient was described as a 55-year-old man who was recovering in New Jersey; Dr. Berger is a 55-year-old man who has self-isolated in New Jersey. New Jersey authorities have confirmed that a 55-year-old man from Englewood was quarantined for a presumptive positive attended CPAC. He was in stable condition and has been hospitalized since March 4, The Englewood man attended services at a temple in New Rochelle, New York, according to New Jersey commissioner of health Judith Persichille. Schlapp shook hands with the president and mingled with Ivanka Trump, Lara Trump and Jared Kushner during the event in Washington, D.C,'s Maryland suburbs but says he's 'healthy as a horse' and has urged attendees not to panic. Cruz, however, announced last Sunday: 'Last night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for COVID-19. 'That interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.' It was later announced that a second lawmaker, Arizona Republican Paul Gosar, and three members of his staff had also gone into quarantine following 'contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus.'"
1,White House coronavirus expert Dr. Anthony Fauci says a complete US shutdown is 'on the table' and warns the crisis could last TWO MONTHSÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109075/White-House-coronavirus-expert-Dr-Anthony-Fauci-says-crisis-eight-weeks.html,"White House coronavirus expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Friday morning that the current state of crisis in the US would last for two months and that 'it's all on the table' in terms of how much more severe things may become. In a series of interviews with Good Morning America and CBS This Morning, Fauci gave his bleak assessment of what is still to come. 'It's certainly going to get worse before it gets better...there's no doubt we have not peaked yet,' he said. Asked directly if America was heading towards a complete shutdown like China and Italy, he would not rule it out. 'I'm not sure we're going to get to that. 'I think that would be really rather dramatic, but I can tell you that all things are on the table. 'We just have to respond as things evolve over the days and the weeks,' he said. There has been a dramatic shift in tone from the government in the last several days. At the start of the week, President Trump was advising Americans not to panic and even said the virus would 'go away'. He then shut the border to Europeans, and said on Thursday that even US citizens who test positive for the virus would not be allowed to come home. Fauci's prediction was that there will be at least another several weeks of the current mode of crisis, but that it could last up to two months. 'It will be at least a matter of several weeks.It's unpredictable, but if you look at historically how these things work, it will likely be anywhere from a few weeks to up to eight weeks. 'I hope it's going to be in the earlier part, two, three, four weeks, but it's impossible to make an accurate prediction,' he said. Later, in an interview with CBS, he said it was one of the worst things he had seen in his 36-year career. 'I mean, there have been an awful lot of challenges over the 36 years that I've been doing this. California Gov. Gavin Newsom fumed on Thursday that the CDC had sent hospitals and labs COVID-19 tests with some of the crucial parts missing. In a press conference, he said: 'The test kits do not include in every case the RNA extraction kits, the reagents, the chemicals, the solutions that are components of the broader tests. 'This is imperative that the federal government and labs across the United States, not just state of California, get the benefit of all the ingredients, the components of the test. 'I am surprised this is not more of the national conversation. 'I think itâ€™s very much in line with your going to the store and purchasing a printer but forgetting to purchase the ink.' Fauci, addressing the disastrous testing blunder on Friday morning, said it was 'unfortunate'. 'Obviously HIV/AIDS, that was a disruption for beginning a very selected demographic group in the country even though there was a lot of general fear. 'With regard to disruption of everyday life, we have not seen that before. We've not had this kind of a situation before. 'I mean, we've had pandemics, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu was a pandemic, but it was influenza. 'We were familiar with what influenza does. Familiar with its seasonal capability. 'Right now there are a lot of unknowns, I think that's the thing that's frightening people.' Fauci told congress on Thursday that the healthcare system had was failing and that there were not enough tests to go around or get done fast enough. On Friday, he was more optimistic and said 'very soon' there will be wider scope for testing but he did not give specifics of where these tests would be available and who was producing them. Experts say one of the largest problems is that so many people who are not yet showing symptoms are continuing the spread the virus without knowing it. Because of the lack of tests, only those who show symptoms and seem ill are being given them. That will change soon, Fauci said. 'The system as it was designed, was designed for what it was designed for. 'Let's look ahead, and I believe what we're hearing at the task force that we are now getting into that phase where we'll be able to really scale it up a lot. 'I think in the next week or so, you're going to see an acceleration of availability of tests. 'Right now as I've mentioned many times and I'll stick by it, early on, the way the system was designed, as good a system as it was, it was not a design to approach that broad blanket testing. 'We're on our way to that now, and we'll be able to do it relatively soon,' he said. To CBS, he added: 'It's not going to all happen tomorrow or the next day. 'It's going to start going like this -- that relatively soon that kind of issue that was just mentioned by the person who spoke hopefully will no longer be existing.' However all the tests currently being used take several days to make a positive diagnosis.  Dr. Fauci refused to urge the president to get tested for COVID-19 after coming into contact with the Brazilian president and one of his aides who has the virus, but said if it were him, he likely would. Trump and President Jair Bolsonaro had dinner at Mar-a-Lago on March 7, a day after one of his key aides tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro is now awaiting the results of his own test, but the White House says Trump has not had one. The Mirror claimed on Friday that he had tested positive for the virus. That is yet to be confirmed by Brazilian officials. Fauci said on Friday morning that he did not want to comment too strongly on the decision and that Trump and his doctors would know the best course of action. But when pushed, Fauci admitted that he would likely have a test if it were him who had come into contact with the infected aide. 'I leave that to the president's white house physician who is an extremely competent individual who I know well, and the decisions there were between what would be a potential patient and the physician,' he said. When asked if he would get a test, he said: 'Likely I would, but I'm not sure. 'It depends on the circumstances. 'We should follow the guidelines of the CDC about when you are at a risk what you should do.' Ivanka Trump was also at the dinner on March 7 and she has another connection to the virus - two days earlier, on March 5, she stood shoulder-to-shoulder with an Australian government minister who has now tested positive for the virus. It is unclear whether or not she has been tested. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday night that the situation may remain like this for six months. He has taken the extraordinary step of declaring a state of emergency and banning gatherings of 500 people or more in the city. Any businesses that choose to remain open whose capacity is less than that has been told to operate at no more than 50 percent occupancy. It puts an incredible strain on businesses. 'We're worried about people's livelihoods... we're worried about people being able to pay their rent,' de Blasio said on Thursday night. Trump said on Thursday afternoon that any Americans who are overseas and who test positive for coronavirus will not be allowed back into the country. There is grave concern over what is being done though to test people when they get back to the US, or even. The stock market has tanked as a result of the pandemic, dropping 2,000 points on Thursday in the worst day of trading for decades. The Federal Reserve Bank has injected $1.5 trillion into the market to stop them from falling again. Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche announced on Friday that it has received emergency approval from US regulators for a new and much faster coronavirus test. On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an 'emergency use authorization' to commercialize the test, which is 10 times faster than the American government's kit. The test can be run in high volumes on fully automated equipment, Roche said, suggesting it could provide more results far faster than other tests available. Widespread testing is essential in the race to rein in the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 134,000 people and killed more than 5,000 worldwide. The new Roche tests, which will also now be available in markets that accept the European CE-mark certification, can provide results within about three-and-a-half hours, the company said. In a 24-hour period, the largest machines can reportedly process up to 4,128 tests. 'It is important to quickly and reliably detect whether a patient is infected' with the virus,' Schinecker said, insisting that speeding up the process of providing reliable diagnostics was 'crucial to combat this serious disease.' Roche said it would have millions of tests available each month, and that it was committed to pushing the limits of its production capacity and delivering as many tests as possible. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the FDA, praised the news on Twitter, saying it would 'significantly improve' the capacity to test patients across all labs. In the US, more than 1,700 people have been infected and 41 people have died, but Gottlieb said the figures are probably lower than the true number. 'We are likely to find that spread is far more distributed in communities across US and while total case count may still be in high thousands or probably low ten thousands, the widespread seeding make an epidemic inevitable,' he tweeted. 'We must focus on slowing spread through tough mitigation steps and reducing the scope and severity of the epidemic by good medical planning. 'Every day, every hour, is critical to preparedness.' "
2,Dozens of New Yorkers say they have been LAID OFF and restaurant owners fear they could lose up to 80% of business because of the ban on gatherings of more than 500 peopleÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109073/New-Yorkers-say-LAID-states-emergency-coronavirus-rules.html,"New York residents have said they have been laid off and left with no way to pay rent because of the rules introduced by the state to try to contain the spread of coronavirus. All Broadway workers have been sent home as the industry closed for the first time since 9/11. Restaurants are shutting their doors across the state after sales fell up to 70 percent in the last week and the state issued rules demanding they cut customer numbers by half, leaving the roughly 10 percent of the New York working population reliant on the industry in limbo. New York's largest Chinese restaurant closed its doors after 48 years on Thursday and workers in Broadway, the restaurant industry, and public entertainment spaces such as gyms took to social media to ask how they will survive after losing their livelihoods overnight. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday afternoon that all gatherings of 500 or more people across New York state will be banned as of 5pm Friday. Public spaces with an occupancy of 500 people or fewer - such as bars, restaurants and gyms - are also required to operate at 50 percent of their capacity. Broadway was first to take the hit, with the lights going out on all New York's shows from 5pm Thursday. The landmark move saw New York City close its biggest source of tourism for a month - the longest closure in its history and its first since 9/11 - as all Broadway theaters exceed the 500-person capacity. Broadway workers took to social media asking for the support from the governor and mayor after they've lost their livelihoods overnight. Broadway is New York's biggest tourist draw raking in sales of $1.83 billion in the last year. This means it is big business and as well as actors and musicians, it provides employment for thousands ofstagehands, ushers, and other professionals working behind the scenes. Actor and singer Matthew Cody Lang tweeted Cuomo Thursday asking how Broadway staff would be able to make ends meet and pay rent. 'what is your plan to save everyone who you just helped lose their job for a month or more? There are hourly workers who are completely screwed because of your safety precautions. Please give more/better solutions! #nyc #broadway,' he wrote. Many workers in the acting industry are on hourly rates, he pointed out: 'there are hourly workers who have no source of income now that you shut down Broadway for a month or more! What're we supposed to do? Are you going to pay our rent? Are you going to feed us? Are you going to help us at all??? #nyc #broadway @playbill @nytimes.' Another Broadway worker tweeted: 'Welp, #Broadway shutdown means I don't have a job for an unclear amount of time... #CoronaVirusUpdate' Starting Friday at 5pm, gatherings with 500 people or more will not be permitted in NYS. Additionally, for facilities with an occupancy of 500 or fewer, we are reducing the legal capacity by 50%.' This ban includes Broadway theaters in Manhattan, New York City, which all seat upwards of 500 people and where the ban will start at 5pm Thursday and continue until April 12 - dwarfing the theater district's two-day closure after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the city.  'For Broadway theaters in Manhattan, these rules will go into effect at 5pm TODAY,' Cuomo tweeted. 'We have already spoken to the theaters about these new measures and they agreed.' Cuomo also said the state is taking measures to create a 'reserve workforce of health care professionals in the event of a staffing shortage'. De Blasio had urged Broadway to stay open in an interview with CNN Thursday morning, after it emerged Wednesday that an usher who worked two theaters on the Great White Way had tested positive for coronavirus. The usher had worked performances of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' at the Booth Theatre and 'SIX' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, meaning thousands of theater-goers may have been exposed to the deadly virus. De Blasio said the aim was to reach a 'kind of balance' and avoid a total closure. 'I don't want to see Broadway go dark if we can avoid it. I want to see if we strike some kind of balance,' he said. 'If we cannot strike the balance of course we can go to closure that's the decision we will make right away.' Broadway producers held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss plans to halt all productions with immediate effect, according to reports on Deadline. 'Something has to be done to help those whose jobs have shut down due to the coronavirus. I'm out of work for my day job for a whole month because of the #BroadwayShutdown. How the flippity flip am I supposed to pay my rent this month?!?' posted another. Like Broadway, sports arenas like the Barclay's Center and Madison Square Garden will also stand empty for months as they face entire closures across sites. Under the 50 percent capacity rules, bars, restaurants and other public spaces can legally stay open but must halve the number of customers they let through their doors. The impact of the new rules on New York businesses, which came as Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency and cases in the state skyrocketed past 300, is prompting hundreds of layoffs across restaurants. Even ahead of Thursday's ban, bookings were down by 30 percent in New York City restaurants and its cancellation rate was 45 percent higher than normal, according to figures from restaurant reservation platform Resy. The New York State Restaurant Association said that restaurant sales were also down by up to 70 percent over the past week, as anxious New Yorkers were swapping dining out for stockpiling groceries and staying at home. In Sunset Park, four dim sum restaurants were forced to close earlier in the week because they weren't getting enough customers through their doors, the president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce Randy Peers told The Gothamist. The large restaurants draw big groups for special occasions, he said , and 'all of that stuff is now going to be put on hold.' Just a day before the capacity rules were announced, de Blasio had urged New Yorkers to continue to eat at restaurants, and emphasized that the virus isn't transmitted through food and drinks. But the capacity rules now means many will struggle to survive at all. With almost 10% of all jobs in New York are in restaurant and foodservice jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association, meaning households across the state will be left struggling to pay rent and bills. Jing Fong, New York's largest Chinese restaurant, closed its doors on Thursday after 48 years open, almost immediately after Cuomo's announcement. Claudia Leo, the restaurant's marketing director, told the NY Post that its Elizabeth Street site was already struggling to draw in crowds amid the mass panic over coronavirus. The ban on the large group gatherings was the final nail in the coffin for the 800-seat restaurant. 'We were going back and forth on what to do all day,' Leo said, adding that they considered 'shrinking' the seating to less than half its full capacity. 'It is all happening very fast. We were trying to take it all in. It is the best decision for everyone's sake,' she said. One bar worker wrote on Twitter Friday morning how jobs she had secured are now on hold as bars are in need of fewer staff amid the crisis. 'I went from successfully securing three wine jobs to all of them being postponed because of coronavirus,' she posted. 'New York is in a state of emergency. Idk whatâ€™s going to happen next. Send good vibes that things will blow over soon because your girl has bills to pay.' Brooklyn food marketSmorgasburg, home to several local food vendors, has been forced to close altogether due to the restrictions. Smorgasburg posted the news on its Instagram Friday and spoke of concerns that small businesses rely on the market for survival. 'In light of the Governorâ€™s coronavirus announcement, effective immediately, all markets are being put on hiatus. 'We remain hopeful that during this dormant period the health situation will come under some level of control, and that if (and when!) we are able to return, people will feel comfortable returning to Smorgasburg to gather with our community as we begin to find the new normal,' the post said. 'This is not an easy decision, as hundreds of small businesses rely heavily on our markets to survive... we look forward to seeing you on the other side.' The New York State Restaurant Association, which represents restaurant owners across the state, published an open letter Thursday calling on Cuomo to provide respite for restaurants now feeling the hit. Melissa Fleischut, the president and CEO of the New York State Restaurant Association, said several restaurants have already closed indefinitely and 'the dramatic decline in business will only get worse,' saidFleischut. 'We have member restaurants who have seen a 55 percent decrease in their business, and if they were to take on any additional costs they may not be able to stay in business,' Fleischut wrote. 'For some restaurants, it may be impossible to keep their doors open.' She added:'We want to stay open and keep employees on the payroll, but for some that will not be possible if this pandemic, and the associated quarantines, continue for even the next month.' Fleischut is calling on officials to providetax breaks, cap food delivery service fees and removing late-payment fees related to business and property taxes. Neither de Blasio nor Cuomo have yet given any clarity over how the state plans to support the businesses most impacted by the new measures. As well as restaurants and bars, the capacity rules are also taking their toll on cinemas, gyms and sports facilities. Many of the boutique fitness classes across the state operate on a cost per class basis. Now able to take just half the classes, this means half the income. 'My job place is about to close ( a gym) and honestly I'm getting freak out .. I have bills to pay my guy #coronavirus,' one distressed New Yorker who suddenly found themselves unemployed tweeted Thursday. Then there's museum staff, such as at the Metropolitan Museum of Art which announced Thursday that it was closing three of its locations across the city. While these may be the hardest-hit industries, many other New York residents have also posted online about losing jobs in various sectors. 'Iâ€™m a first gen. college student from Washington state living in New York at attending St. Johnâ€™s university. My school shut down and Iâ€™m out of a job (workstudy student) until whenever school starts back up. Iâ€™m dorming and away from family. My Cashapp is $DamariPeralezLong !' one person tweeted. A worker at a school wrote of hope that the education system won't be the next to face the chop, saying she wouldn't be able to survive in that eventuality. 'Tha sad thing is new york is saying its not going to close its schools and im happy about that. if i dont work i dont get paid. If the schools shut down i would have no find a new job cuz i cant go a whole month or so without pay,' the anxious woman tweeted. Mass panic over how comes as Mayor de Blasio said Friday the city's coronavirus tally remained at 95, with no new cases confirmed overnight. He also reiterated his previous sentiment that New York is not closing down but is very much open for business. 'New Yorkers don't scare easily,' he said on Fox 5's Good Day New York Friday morning. De Blasio also slammed rumors that all of Manhattan was in quarantine as 'a lie'."
3,Ivanka Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr posed with Australian government minister days before he tested positive for coronavirus and 48 hours before she had dinner with her father at Mar-a-LagoÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108939/Ivanka-Trump-Bill-Barr-posed-Australian-politician-coronavirus.html,"Ivanka Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr posed for a photograph with Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton days before he tested positive for coronavirus. The trio stood shoulder to shoulder in Washington DC on March 5 as part of a meeting between officials from the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US. The next day, she attended an event at Mar-a-Lago with her father and Brazilian presidentJair Bolsonaro, the same day that one ofBolsonaro's aides tested positive for the virus. Senator Lindsey Graham has self-quarantined because he was at Mar-a-Lago at the same time as the infected aide Fabio Wajngarten, but the White House has not said whether Trump or his daughter Ivanka have been tested or taken extra precautions. Dutton confirmed on Friday morning, March 13 - a week after their meeting - that he had tested positive after returning to Australia. He has since been being treated in the hospital and the severity of his condition remains unknown.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in isolation after his wife tested positive. Scroll down for video Trump has not addressed whether or not he has been tested since spending time with Bolsonaro. The White House said earlier this week that he had not. It is not known whether Ivanka or Barr, or any other officials who are not showing symptoms have been infected. As of Friday morning, there were more than 1,700 cases of coronavirus in the US and 41 people had died from it. The government has predicted that as many as 150million Americans will eventually become infected. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House coronavirus expert, said on Friday morning in an interview on Good Morning America that he did not want to comment on Trump's condition or whether or not he should get a test. He said that if it were him, however, he likely would. 'I leave that to the president's white house physician who is an extremely competent individual who I know well, and the decisions there were between what would be a potential patient and the physician,' he said. 'Likely I would, but I'm not sure. It depends on the circumstances. We should follow the guidelines of the CDC about when you are at a risk what you should do,' he added. Fauci went on to say that the current state of crisis could last for up to eight weeks. Flights from Europe to the US are stopping at midnight on Friday. Americans who are overseas will be able to come home unless they too test positive for the virus in which case, according to comments made by the president, they will not be allowed to board planes. A state of emergency has been declared in New York City, Broadway has shut down and large gatherings of more than 500 people have been banned. Businesses have been told they must operate at half their legal capacity - putting enormous strain on shift workers and small business owners, some of whom have been advised to shut up shop until the chaos subsides. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday the situation may last for six months."
4,"High blood pressure and diabetes medication taken by 13 million Americans could raise the risk of serious coronavirus symptoms, scientists say",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8109453/High-blood-pressure-diabetes-drugs-raise-risk-coronavirus-symptoms.html,"People with high blood pressure and diabetes could be at higher risk of serious coronavirus symptoms because of their medications, scientists say. According to a new research letter, certain drugs for these health conditions may change the shape of someone's cells in a way that makes it easier for the virus to infect them and cause a more severe illness. These medications,called ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, are taken by at least 13 million Americans every year. Scientists not associated with the research say it does not prove a link between the medications and severe COVID-19 - the disease caused by the virus - but that a potential connection should be studied more closely. It comes as the outbreak continues to sweep the US, sickening more than 1,700 Americans and killing 41 people in seven states. For the letter, published in the journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, the team examined how coronavirus latches on to people's cells to infect them. Researchers from University Hospital Basel in Switzerland and the University of Thessaloniki in Greece explained that the virus binds to cells by latching onto a receptor. These receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),are found on the surface of upper respiratory cells. Some with high blood pressure or diabetes have to take drugs that increase the amount of ACE2 they have on their cells, in order to control their illness. Among the most commonly prescribed in the US are Accupril, Losartan, Lotensin, Valsartan and Vasotec, according to the US Food And Drug Administration. The team then looked atother studies of coronavirus patients with pre-existing conditions. They found that the most common among severely-ill patients were high blood pressure (23.7 percent), diabetes (16.2 percent) and heart disease (5.8 percent). And by studying how coronavirus and SARS, which is almost identical, attach to cells inside people's bodies they could work out how the blood pressure drugs might make this easier for the viruses. They also added that people with diabetes and high blood pressure might be more at risk because of changes in their genes which make them produce more ACE2 naturally. 'These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment withACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression,' the authors wrote. 'Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. 'We therefore hypothesize that diabetes and hypertension [high blood pressure] treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.' The researchers suggest that patients with these pre-existing conditions be monitored for the virus even more tan the general public. But some health experts warn patients not top stop taking their medications and to speak to their doctors if they have concerns. 'This letter does not report the results of a study,' said Dr Tim Chico, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Sheffield in the UK.' 'It simply raises a possible question about whether a type of blood pressure and heart disease medication called ACE inhibitors might increase the chances of severe COVID19 infections. 'I strongly advise anyone on heart medications not to stop or change these without discussion with their doctor. 'If a patient stops their medication and worsens to the point of requiring admission to hospital at the same time as we are dealing with an increase in COVID19 cases, that would pose the patient a considerable risk and put further strain on the healthcare services.'"
5,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims 'the more rich and powerful you are the easier it is to get a coronavirus test' as she blasts Donald Trump's response to the crisis,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109025/Coronavirus-tests-easier-youre-rich-says-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez.html,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has blasted the US response to the coronavirus crisis â€“ saying that more needs to be done more quickly to protect working-class Americans from the disease. The New York Democrat hit out at Donald Trump's claim that the US 'has the best healthcare system anywhere in the world', pointing out that South Korea is testing 10,000 per day compared to just a handful in the US. 'It almost seems like the more wealthy and powerful you are, the more able you are to access a test,' she told Fox Newson Thursday. 'But the rougher the road you've got here, the more difficult it will be to access healthcare. That's exactly the recipe for a disaster in a pandemic.' Widespread problems have been reported across the country with coronavirus testing, with medics unable to keep up with demand. While the White House has promised that millions of Americans will get test kits, data available suggests that number is currently in the low tens of thousands. The CDC admitted that it had only tested 77 people in the first two days of this week, while state numbers recorded by the COVID Tracking Project late Thursday reported 15,000 tests had been carried out. But inconsistencies in the data â€“ with some states only reporting positive results and others reporting none at all â€“ means the true figure remains unknown. According to federal guidelines, only those who have travelled to a country where the disease is endemic â€“ such as China, Italy and South Korea â€“ qualify for a test, along with those who have come into contact with a confirmed case. But as the disease sweeps rapidly across the country, it has become virtually impossible to know for sure where confirmed cases are and who might have come into contact with those people. Trump made only a brief mention of testing during his Wednesday evening address to the nation on coronavirus, with no pledge to ramp up testing nationwide. Other countries have also largely given up on testing as the disease rapidly spreads, with the UK advising that those with only mild symptoms will not be offered tests. Test kits will only be given to those who require hospital treatment with symptoms similar to those known for coronavirus. In late February, workers at Massachusetts biotech firm Biogen were told they did not qualify for tests despite several staff testing positive for the virus after a company-wide meeting. Two weeks later, 77 were confirmed positive out of 91 total cases in the state. The number of coronavirus cases recorded across the US is fast approaching the 2,000 mark with 41 recorded deaths, though experts have warned the true number of cases could be ten times higher. Meanwhile stock markets have tanked 20 per cent into 'bear market' territory not seen since the 2008 crash as fears over the virus grow. The Trump administration has been widely criticized for its slow response to the disease, which the President initially downplayed as little worse than the flu. In fact, those researching the disease say it is many times more deadly than seasonal flu â€“ with those over 60 and with underlying health conditions most at risk. Trump on Wednesday announced a ban on all travellers coming to the US from the EU's 26-nation Schengen borderless zone for 30 days, with US citizens, permanent residents and their relatives exempt. The ban is due to come into effect from Friday at midnight, though it is still largely unclear how it will be enforced. Trump also stopped short of announcing widespread testing or bans on public gatherings and internal travel across the US â€“ measures adopted by other outbreak hotspots such as Italy. Globally, coronavirus has sickened more than 125,000 people and killed almost 5,000. Experts believe it could ultimately infect 70 per cent of the global population, with the potential for hundreds of millions of deaths â€“ making it the deadliest pandemic since Spanish Flu in 1918."
6,Jared Kushner asks Karlie Kloss's doctor father how to beat the coronavirus crisis after being put in charge by Donald Trump - so model's dad asks FACEBOOK for suggestions,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108159/Jared-Kushner-asks-Karlie-Klosss-doctor-father-help-asked-research-coronavirus.html,"Jared Kushner enlisted the help of model Karlie Kloss's father, a doctor, to help figure out what the U.S. should do about coronavirusâ€“ who in turn asked for suggestions via Facebook. The astonishing revelation was uncover by theSpectator USA. Jared Kushner was brought in by his father-in-law Donald Trump earlier this week to lead the response to coronavirus. He has no medical qualifications and has also been in charge of Middle East peace, for which he boasted about reading '25 books.' Kurt Kloss, an emergency room doctor in upstate New York, created a post in a 22,000-member private group for doctors that asked for 'serious suggestions' about how to respond to coronavirus. 'If you were in charge of Federal response to the Pandemic what would your recommendation be,' he wrote. 'I have a direct channel to the person now in charge at the White House.' 'Please only serious responses,' he added, according to a screenshot obtained by the Spectator USA. 'I have already expressed concern for need for ventilators and more PPE for frontline and test kits.' Then he explained who he was, finding time to boast about his daughter's success, and later he boasted 'Jared is reading now.' He goes on to identify himself as Karlie's father and claims to have been talking to Jared for weeks about his concerns via his bother Joshua, who is Karlie's husband. 'Tonight I was asked by Jared through my son in-law for my recommendations, that's when I turned to you guysâ€¦ for help,' he wrote in a post that appears to have been uploaded Wednesday. After hours of back-and-forth discussions, Mr Kloss came up with a 13-point list to forward to the White House that included 'nationalized production of [protective equipment] and test kits, pop-up field hospitals, draconian travel ban and ban on all mass gatherings'. The post asking for suggestions appears to have been uploaded around 9pm Wednesday, meaning Jared reached out for help around the same time Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office. In the widely-criticized address, Trump announced a ban on travellers who had been to any country in the 26-state European Schengen borderless zone from coming to the US for 30 days. He did not announce a federal state of emergency, and made no moves to ban travel within the US, ban large-scale gatherings or close schools and other public institutions, as some state governments have already started doing. He briefly mentioned testing kits but made no promise about wide-scale testing. The CDC has since admitted that it tested only 77 people for the illness this week. There are currently 1,758 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US and 41 confirmed deaths, though experts have warned that the true number of cases could be ten times higher. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is pushing for coronavirus to be declared a national emergency to unlock funding and resources for states to manage outbreaks, according to Politico. But Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of the US response, is said to be wary of taking the step for fear that it will put US stock markets into a tailspin. Wall Street has already lost more than 20 per cent of its value since the crisis began and has entered 'bear market' territory not seen since the 2008 crash. Trump is also said to be reticent to declare an emergency because it runs counter to his early assertions that coronavirus is equivalent to seasonal flu. Health experts have been warning for weeks that the virus is, in fact, many times more deadly than flu â€“ though, like flu, is most likely to kill the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Caught in a quandary, Trump is said to be waiting for Kushner's report on the crisis before making a decision. Up to 150 million Americans could be infected with the coronavirus top doctors believe, a Congresswoman confirmed Thursday as vast swathes of the country shutdown Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib confirmed earlier reports that Congress' doctor Dr. Brian Monahan has told lawmakers that he predicts between 70 to 150 million people in the United States could eventually be infected with the novel coronavirus. The startling figures were revealed as many public spaces, airports, streets and highways became deserted of people and cars Thursday evening and panicked shoppers rushed to buy supplies. Disney Parks and Capitol Hill were among the many places closed off to the public as Broadway also went dark. Dr. Monahan's prediction underscores how severe the outbreak could become in the U.S. as the White House continues to downplay the severity and asks the public to remain calm. He originally shared the information with a closed-door meeting of Senate senior staff on Tuesday when they were told they should prepare for the worst. 1) Nationalize as in war time production of PPE's, testing kits and ventilators 2) Suspend EMTALA (the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) 3) Activate FEMA and DMAT teams 4)Pop up Field Hospitals with ICU capability Israel seems to have expertise 5)Decentralized testing away from hospital or if on hospital away from ED (emergency department) 6)Drive through testing capability and I would add pulse ox capability 7)Draconian travel restrictions 8)Canceling all mass gatherings 9)Massive marketing of PSA explaining what patients to do especially not going to ED if not in respiratory distress (Need to refine this message) 10)National Telemedicine for screening 11)Locking down Nursing Homes require all care givers in full gear and frequent testing 12)Use state ACEP (American College of Emergency Physicians) for some sort of incident command structure 13)Use emergency funding to compensate quarantined"
7,Donald Trump blames OBAMA for coronavirus testing fiasco he oversaw himself - in latest denial of his own responsibility for what Dr. Fauci called 'a failing',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108805/Donald-Trump-blames-OBAMA-coronavirus-testing-fiasco-oversaw.html,"President Trump blamed his predecessor, President Obama, for the coronavirus test not being easily accessible to Americans in a set of Friday morning tweets. 'For decades @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped,' Trump wrote. 'President Obama made changes that only complicated things further,' the president offered. Trump then went on to call the Obama administration's response to Swine Flu 'a full scale disaster, with thousands dying.'The president said nothing 'meaningful' has been done to fix the testing problem 'until now.' 'The changes havebeen made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis,' he tweeted. 'All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!' Trump's comments came after Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified frankly on Capitol Hill Thursday. He told lawmakers sitting on the House Oversight Committee that Americans were not 'easily' able to be tested for the virus and called it a 'failing.' Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz had brought up concerns to the witnesses that health care professionals, in her example nurses, were unable to obtain the test after potentially being exposed to the virus. 'The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we're not,' Fauci said on Capitol Hill. 'That is a failing. It is a failing. Let's admit it,' he also said. The development of a coronavirus test in the U.S. has not gone smoothly, as early test kits were sometimes inaccurate. There were also rules set in place to narrowly define who might get tested. Wasserman Schultz brought up a nurse who, despite having symptons, was refused a test by the CDC. 'They said they would not test me because if I was wearing the recommended protective equipment, then I wouldn't have the coronavirus,' the nurse said. 'What kind of science-based answer is that?' Additionally, Fauci andRobert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, talked about the problems of bringing the tests to scale in order to get them, more broadly, to American patients. 'Itâ€™s really the engagement of the private sector to get these tests into clinical medicine, which is a partnership between the private sector and CDC,' Redfield testified Thursday. Wasserman Schultz asked, 'Basically you're saying ... there's not one person that can ensure that these tests can be administered? Yes or no?' 'The system is not really geared to what we need right now - what you are asking for,' Fauci answered.'The system was geared for the individual doctor-patient, what we're dealing with now transcends that,' he also explained. Trump, meanwhile, was in the Oval Office with the prime minister of Ireland painting a rosy picture about the testing. 'They have a million tests out now. Over the next few days they'll have 4 million tests out,' Trump told reporters saying testing ''is going very smooth.'"
8,I'd 'likely' have got tested after contact with coronavirus victim: Tony Fauci is challenged on Donald Trump's refusal to be tested after meeting Brazilian with the virus and says 'follow the CDC guidelines',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109323/Tony-Fauci-challenged-Trumps-refusal-tested-meeting-Brazilian-coronavirus.html,"Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said he himself would 'likely' have been tested after coming in contact with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the coronavirus â€“ something President Trump is pointedly refusing to do. Fauci made the statement in a morning television interview where he got pressed on why the president would resist being tested despite his interaction with the Brazilian at Mar-a-Lago, even after also coming into contact with a series of Republicans who were at the CPAC conference and put themselves into self quarantine. The White House has said Trump won't get tested, despite coming into contact with Bolsonaroâ€™s communications director, FÃ¡bio Wajngarten. 'I leave that to the president's White House physician who is an extremely competent individual who I know well, and the decisions there were between what would be a potential patient and the physician,' said Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health. But when pushed, Fauci admitted that he would likely have a test if it were him who had come into contact with the infected aide. When asked if he would get a test, he said: 'Likely I would, but I'm not sure. 'It depends on the circumstances,' he added. 'We should follow the guidelines of the CDC about when you are at a risk what you should do.' Commander Sean Conley is the White House physician. Trump had dinner with Bolsonaro at his Mar-a-Lago club March 7, a day after one of his key aides tested positive for the virus. Trump was already facing criticism for flying to his private club last weekend immediately after receiving a briefing on the virus at the Centers for Disease Control. He hosted a lavish party for Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle Saturday night.Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner all were there. Trump flew to a fundraiser in Orlando on Monday, then returned to Washington Monday afternoon with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who immediately put himself into isolation after learning he came in contact with a man at a CPAC conference who had tested positive. Fauci gave a more direct response when asked about the situation on MSNBC. 'Iâ€™d leave that to the presidentâ€™s physician. They have a very good White House physician and physician staff there. So when you have a situation of a patient doctor relationship, the advice for that should come from the White House physician,' he said. Interviewer Willie Geist followed up: 'But generally speaking if I were standing next to someone who had been diagnosed with coronavirus should I isolate myself and find a test as well?' 'Yes,' Fauci responded. Ivanka Trump was also at the dinner on March 7 and she has another connection to the virus - two days earlier, on March 5, she stood shoulder-to-shoulder with an Australian government minister who has now tested positive for the virus. It is unclear whether or not she has been tested.    "
9,Nancy Pelosi is on verge of a deal with White House to guarantee free coronavirus testing and two weeks sick pay to all Americans even though Donald Trump is STILL demanding his payroll tax cut,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8103329/In-battle-against-virus-Trump-restricts-travel-Europe.html," Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that she and the Trump administration are close to agreement on a multibillion-dollar coronavirus aid package to reassure anxious Americans by providing sick pay, free testing and other resources, hoping to calm teetering financial markets amid the mounting crisis. Final details were being worked out, but the top House Democrat, who held daylong talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, expected an announcement Friday. The House could then swiftly vote. 'We have - are near - to an agreement,' Pelosi said, emerging from her office at the Capitol shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday. Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke eight times on Thursday, according to the speaker's office, a negotiation that comes as the Pelosi and the president do not appear to be in direct contact. Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke for a ninth time Friday morning as the House prepares to vote on the package deal. 'Negotiations are going very well. This has been a bipartisan effort,' Mnuchin said on CNBC Friday morning ahead of the markets opening. 'I think we are very close to getting this done.' Trump - who tasked Mnuchin with making a deal with Pelosi - has been pushing for the inclusion of a payroll tax cut but Democrats, and many Republicans, are against including that measure. 'If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!,' he wrote on Twitter Friday morning. A payroll tax cut is not part of the current negotiations between Pelosi and Mnuchin. And the president indicated Thursday he didn't support the House package even as his Treasury chief was in negotiations with the speaker. 'No, there are things in there that had nothing to do of what we are talking about. It is not a way for them to get some of the goodies they have been able to get for the last 25 year,' Trump said at the White House. The Senate, meanwhile, canceled its scheduled recess next week so the upper chamber can vote on the package after its passed by the House. If it's approved by the Senate, it would go to Trump's desk. 'Notwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the Senate will be in session next week,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote on Twitter. 'I am glad talks are ongoing between the Administration and Speaker Pelosi. I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong.' The potential deal between Congress and the White House would cap a tumultuous week in which Washington strained for a comprehensive response to the outbreak that is testing the nation's political, financial and health care systems. It builds on an emergency $8.3 billion package approved last week and is aimed at providing additional health and financial resources to arrest the sudden spread of the pandemic and the kind of economic fallout unseen in a generation. Pelosi promised in a letter to colleagues that a third package was yet to come. The new sick leave benefit would require businesses to provide up to 14 days of paid leave to workers who are home quarantined with the virus, with the federal government reimbursing them through tax credits. The bill enhances unemployment benefits for the jobless and boosts food and nutrition programs for working families, students and seniors. The late announcement was intended to boost confidence, Democrats said. 'We felt that putting together something that the American people can see cooperation on between the two parties in this difficult moment would be a confidence builder,' said Rep. Richard Neal, D-N.J., the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joining Pelosi at the Capitol, 'and I think that we approached it that way.' Meanwhile, the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court all declared themselves off limits to the public for now, symbols of a nation hunkering down. Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump's chief rival, criticized him for playing down the threat for weeks and promised if he becomes president to 'always tell you the truth.' Amid a wave of closures and cancellations, the coronavirus question got personal for Trump and some members of Congress. Just days after meeting Trump and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the communications chief for Brazil's president, FÃ¡bio Wajngarten, tested positive for the coronavirus. A photo of the president, the senator and Wajngarten shows the trio shoulder-to-shoulder at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort last weekend. It was the first time someone infected with the virus was known to have been in close proximity to the president. Scott said he was isolating himself. Trump, 73, said he was unworried. 'We had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire delegation,' Trump told reporters at the White House. 'But we did nothing very unusual. We sat next to each other for a period of time.' Asked whether he should be tested, Trump replied, 'I am not concerned.' White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said 'the White House is aware of public reports that a member of the Brazilian delegation's visit to Mar-a-Lago last weekend tested positive for COVID-19' though; confirmatory testing is pending. She said: 'Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time.' GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was also at Trump's club on the weekend, joined a growing list of lawmakers who have chosen to isolate themselves as a precaution. On Wednesday, Trump announced a month-long restriction on travel from most of Europe, set to begin at midnight Friday night. He said Thursday that he was considering other major restrictions, such as limiting travel to domestic hot spots like California and Washington state, without spelling out how he would manage such an extraordinary effort. The State Department issued a global advisory cautioning U.S. citizens to 'reconsider travel abroad.' So far, the administration's haphazard response and the stalemate in Congress have resulted in more uncertainty as the crisis roils the financial markets and rewrites daily life for Americans. Biden and Bernie Sanders, the other main contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, delivered their own speeches the day after Trump's prime-time address to the nation. Biden called for free virus testing, temporary pop-up hospitals and paid leave for all Americans to help cover paychecks as workers self-quarantine, care for the ill or lose jobs over the virus. 'No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this, when I'm president we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better,' Biden declared. Sanders also proposed swift federal intervention and money to help people suffering in their health or finances. As talks between Pelosi and Mnuchin continued, lawmakers from both parties expressed alarm after what they called heated and testy briefings with Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, and other public health officials. Lawmakers were particularly frustrated that U.S. officials have tested relatively few patients. 'We're basically, in my opinion, flying blind,' said Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev. As classes, sports events, concerts and conferences were canceled across the nation, Trump said he will halt his signature campaign rallies, telling reporters he needs a 'little separation until such time as this goes away.' Biden and Sanders said they would no longer hold large political gatherings and their staffs would work from home as the race for the presidency moved online. The storied Smithsonian said it was canceling all public events and will temporarily close its network of museums and the National Zoo, starting Saturday. And Trump proposed postponing this summer's Olympics in Japan for a year, too. The financial markets endured another day of alarming slides and the Federal Reserve moved to try to ease the disruptions by announcing that it will sharply increase its purchases of short-term Treasury bonds. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it. While Trump said all European travel except from Britain would be cut off, there were clarifications and criticisms of the cornerstone of his attempt to curtail the crisis. Homeland Security officials said the new travel restrictions would apply only to most foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen Area at any point in the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. The area encompasses most European countries, among them France, Italy, German, Greece, Austria and Belgium. The restrictions don't apply to legal permanent residents, immediate family of U.S. citizens or others identified in the proclamation signed by Trump. Vice President Mike Pence said the administration is also asking travelers returning to the U.S. from Europe to voluntarily quarantine for 14 days. But some health officials, and even a former high-ranking Trump administration official, suggested Trump's European travel restriction was futile because the virus is already widespread on U.S. soil. 'In two weeks, we will regret wasting time and energy on travel restrictions and wish we focused more on hospital preparation and large scale community mitigation,' Trump's former homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, tweeted Thursday. Trump claimed falsely Thursday that the U.S. is currently screening all Americans and foreigners who are entering the country, saying, 'people coming in have to be tested.' And he claimed that those who return are being forced to isolate themselves, adding: 'It's going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.' No widespread quarantine orders have been announced."

One family of three paid nearly $8,000 for three one-way tickets from Paris to New York. â€˜I feel like they were putting a price tag on peopleâ€™s safety,â€™ Coral McNary told ABC News on Friday. â€˜Thatâ€™s scary, especially if people canâ€™t afford it.â€™ Jake Genachowski, an American who was traveling in Switzerland, made it back home just in time before the ban kicked in. He said that when he arrived, there was no screening for coronavirus. â€˜Just made it through customs, Genachowski told ABC News shortly after arriving back in the states. He said arriving passengers were asked if they had flu-like symptoms, but they were not asked if they had been to Italy or any other country hard-hit by the coronavirus. Weary and confused travelers, many wearing face masks, rushed to board flights from European airports to the US on Thursday after Trump announced the new travel restrictions. His 30-day travel order applies to citizens of 26 European countries but excludes Britain and Ireland as well as American citizens. It takes effect from midnight on Friday. â€˜It caused a mass panic,â€™ said 20-year-old Anna Grace, a US student on her first trip to Europe who changed her booking to fly home from Madridâ€™s Barajas airport instead of going on to France. Her friends were less successful in rebooking flights. Though American citizens are exempt from the travel ban, Grace and many others said they preferred to return home in case the restrictions are expanded or for fear of contracting coronavirus while in Europe. â€˜We are nervous that we wonâ€™t be able to get back into the country,â€™ said Atlantia resident Jay Harrison, 29, hoping to board a flight in Brussels. â€˜If itâ€™s going to be another 30 days and weâ€™re stranded, itâ€™s going to be very difficult, very expensive and just tough to get back in and tough to live with.â€™ Paola Mesa, 29, a Spanish woman flying from Barcelona to San Francisco, said she backed Trumpâ€™s ban on travel from Europe. â€˜Itâ€™s what Spain should have done before,â€™ she said. The death toll from coronavirus in Spain nearly doubled to 84 on Thursday and the number of cases rose to nearly 3,000. Trump says he had to act as the European Union had failed to take adequate measures to stop the coronavirus. The EU dismissed his comments and criticized the lack of consultation from the US side. Many travelers, however, were critical of Trumpâ€™s decision. â€˜Itâ€™s ridiculous. Why do we impose a ban now when the virus is already in the United States?â€™ said Leo Mota, 24, who had just arrived at Parisâ€™s main international airport, Roissy Charles de Gaulle, from Los Angeles. Miguel Paracuellos, a Spaniard who works in the United States, said Trump was trying to compensate for his failure to expand testing and screening programs at home. â€˜He is blaming an external enemy, in this case Europe,â€™ he said. Jon Lindfors, an American traveler in Paris, was equally scathing about Trump, who will seek re-election in November. â€˜Trump said itâ€™s not a health crisis but it is, that itâ€™s not an economic crisis but it is. We donâ€™t believe what Trump says anymore,â€™ Lindfors said. A Delta crew member, who asked not to be named, said Trumpâ€™s travel ban had caught the airline off-guard. â€˜Itâ€™s going to be a big mess... We were not expecting something like that. We donâ€™t have all the details to know what it means for us and for the company,â€™ the crew member said. At Romeâ€™s Fiumicino airport, largely empty due to draconian measures taken by Italy to combat coronavirus, one Italian traveler just back from New York said the United States would soon face the disruption Europe is now experiencing. â€˜(In New York)... there were only a few flights canceled or delayed... They donâ€™t understand the situation yet,â€™ said Giuseppe Riccio, who wore a face mask. â€˜There are no controls in place, shops are full of people.â€™ Gregory and Ada Goldberg, an American couple from San Francisco, were trying to bring forward their flight home from Barcelona but were not getting much help at the airport. â€˜This was meant to be two weeks of pleasant vacation but it has become a nightmare,â€™ said 69-year-old Ada."
11,More than 6 MILLION children sent home because of the coronavirus pandemic: Six states close all schools and several large school districts shut down to prevent the spread,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109099/More-6-MILLION-kids-sent-home-coronavirus-pandemic-Six-states-close-schools.html,"Six states have ordered their schools to shut down while Washington State is closing schools in three counties near Seattle as more than six million American children will be staying home this month due to the coronavirus outbreak. All public schools and most private schools in Oregon, Ohio, Michigan, Maryland, Kentucky, and New Mexico will shut down schools beginning next week. Washington Governor Jay Inslee also ordered a mandatory, six-week shutdown of all public and private K-12 schools in the three largest counties in the state - King, Pierce, and Snohomish. Inslee has ordered the schools to close by no later than this coming Tuesday, March 17. They will not reopen before Monday, April 27. Seattle has been hit hard by the outbreak, which has so far claimed the lives of 41 Americans. In King County alone, 31 people have died after being infected with coronavirus. So far, there have been more than 1,700 cases of coronavirus nationwide. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 60,000 have so far recovered. San Francisco announced that all of its schools will be shuttered for three weeks beginning Monday and stretching through the end of the regularly scheduled spring break on April 3. The decision was made after four students at Lakeshore Elementary School reported symptoms of pneumonia that officials believe may be due to coronavirus.

In Sacramento County, the Elk Grove Unified School district has also been ordered closed - in addition to a few other school across California. Officials in Los Angeles have so far resisted public calls to close schools, saying that class instruction will continue for the time being, according to the Los Angeles Times. Schools in Texas remain open with the exception of the stateâ€™s largest district - Houston Independent School District, which said it was closing for two weeks. New York, the largest school district in the country, is keeping schools open for the time being. Philadelphia, which has reported at least seven cases of coronavirus, is shutting 63 local schools after a total of 13 coronavirus cases were reported in Montgomery County. Authorities in Arizona have shuttered schools in five districts - Pima Unified School District, Osborn School District, Cartwright School District, Alhambra Elementary School District, and Kyrene School District. As of Thursday evening, there are nine cases of coronavirus in Arizona, with two of them confirmed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are three cases in Maricopa County, five in Pinal County and one in Pima County. The District of Columbia has ordered its public schools to close beginning March 16 until March 31. On March 24, students in D.C. will begin remote learning. Normal class operations are expected to resume on April 1. In Virginia, the largest school district, Fairfax County Public Schools, closed its doors on Friday. In addition to orderings its schools shut for two weeks, Maryland has also activated the National Guard. The Port of Baltimore has been closed to passenger cruise ships and all nonessential state government workers have been told to work from home. In Massachusetts, three schools in Boston and scores of school districts across the state have been ordered closed for varying periods of time."
12,"Dow surges 1,300 points as Congress nears stimulus deal to counter impact from coronavirus after Wall Street's worst day since Black Monday in 1987",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109201/Dow-futures-surge-1-100-points-hit-5-trading-ceiling.html,"U.S. stock indexes surged on Friday morning on hopes of a U.S. stimulus package to cushion the blow of the coronavirus pandemic, a day after Wall Street racked up its worst losses since Black Monday in 1987. The Dow and S&P 500 indexes sank almost 10 percent on Thursday, wiping more than $2 trillion off the value of the S&P and plunging global equities into a bear market on fears the outbreak is plunging the world into recession. However, sentiment stabilized on Friday the 13th after the Federal Reserve injected $1.5 trillion into bond markets to ease a liquidity squeeze, and Congressional Democrats and Republicans signaled they could soon agree on a stimulus deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 773.20 points, or 3.65 percent, at the open to 21,973.82, and quickly surged by as much as 1,300 points in early trading before giving back much of the early gains.   The S&P 500 opened higher by 89.35 points, or 3.60 percent, at 2,569.99. The Nasdaq Composite gained 408.59 points, or 5.67 percent, to 7,610.39 at the opening bell. The rally follows news that the Trump administration and House Democractic leadership are close to announcing an agreement on a coronavirus aid package aimed at reassuring anxious Americans by providing sick pay, free testing and other resources. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday morning that negotiations were going very well. 'I think we're very close to getting this done,' Mnuchin said, appearing on CNBC. The market is still down around 25 percent from mid-February peaks, however, and traders expect more aggressive measures by the Fed next week, including another interest rate cut. Friday the 13th capped off one of the wildest weeks in Wall Street history, with the Dow moving more than 1,000 points up or down four days in a row, and trading being halted automatically an unprecedented two times after the S&P 500 dropped 7 percent in one session. 'What we're headed for is a market that should begin to settle down (with) less high volatility percentage declines,' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. 'Investors are now expecting the government to get the economic plan in place and get it into law.' Shares of major U.S. banks including Bank of America Corp , Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co rose between 4 percent and 5 percent, tracking Treasury yields higher. Cruise liners Carnival Corp, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings were also set to advance after a brutal selloff this week. United Airlines was up 8.6 percent, a day after losing a quarter of its value as the travel disruptions forced it to draw down $2 billion of existing cash reserves. U.S. energy firms Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp also rose more than 4 percent, tracking gains in oil prices. Among individual movers, software company Oracle Corp jumped 9.1 percent after topping quarterly profit and revenue expectations and flagging a 'minimal impact' from the virus outbreak on fourth-quarter revenue. Gap Inc climbed 6.3 percent as it forecast 2020 profit above market expectations. It also flagged a $100 million sales hit in Asia and Europe from the coronavirus outbreak. "
13,"Countries rush to build emergency wards as coronavirus fears spread across Europe: Millions of schoolchildren stay at home, Spain shuts down four towns and Disneyland Paris is closed",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108333/Coronavirus-fears-spread-Europe.html,"Makeshift hospitals are springing up in Europe as coronavirus fears spread across the continent today with Spain and Bulgaria declaring states of emergency and Denmark warning against any foreign travel. Medics have been working from tents in Italy and Poland with patients placed on temporary beds while they are tested for the virus which has now killed more than 1,200 people in Europe. In Russia, diggers were working into the night on a new infectious diseases clinic in the village of Babenki - reminiscent of China's hurried hospital construction when the outbreak began. Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin has ordered the facility built, some 40 miles from the capital, even though Russia currently has among the fewest victims among major countries. France has also vowed to 'massively increase' its hospital capacity, while also trying to contain the virus by banning any gathering of more than 100 people with immediate effect - tightening its earlier 1,000-person limit. Disneyland Paris is shutting its doors on Sunday, in line with other Disney parks in California and Florida, after several of its workers contracted the virus in recent days. The Louvre art gallery is also shut until further notice. Spain and Bulgaria are both declaring states of emergency, with Spanish police blocking roads out of four quarantined towns near Barcelona today as the death toll reached 120. Cases in Spain have soared to more than 4,200 in Europe's worst outbreak outside Italy, while UK officials have advised against unnecessary travel to Madrid and other parts of Spain. Millions of schoolchildren were staying at home across the continent as France,Portugal, Ireland, Malta, Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg became the latest countries to shut their classrooms. Most of Germany's 16 states have also done so today. The Czech Republic has taken even more drastic measures with a ban on all foreign travellers coming in and Czechs leaving the country from March 16. Denmark has taken similarly decisive action with a warning against against unnecessary travel to any destination. In Italy, which is already in lockdown, Catholic churches in Rome have now been shut as the Vatican falls in line with the rest of the country. Football fixtures across Europe have been taking place behind closed doors amid calls for the Euro 2020 tournament to be postponed. Meanwhile, some European passengers were boarding the last flights to America this morning before Donald Trump's unexpected travel ban comes into force tonight. Bulgaria's state of emergency involves the shutting of all shops - except food stores and pharmacies - shopping malls, casinos, bars and restaurants with immediate effect until March 29. The drastic measures leave Britain increasingly out of step with the rest of Europe after Boris Johnson yesterday declined to impose a ban on schools or public events. Europe now has a total of 28,550 cases, more than half of them in Italy, and 1,198 deaths. The new Russian hospital, inspired by the rapidly-built Chinese clinics, will be a 500-bed treatment centre described by Moscow's deputy mayor as 'one of the most modern' medical facilities. Moscow was 'doing everything to prevent the infection from spreading', the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said on Thursday. Russia's health watchdog has warned against using public transport during rush hour and urged Russians to avoid hugging and handshakes. The Chinese authorities constructed a 1,000-bed hospital last month in just 10 days following last December's outbreak of the virus in the Wuhan region. Czech authorities said today they wouldban all foreign travellers from entering and all Czechs from leaving the country as of March 16. 'It's a very tough measure but we think it may fundamentally contribute to stemming the spread of the coronavirus,' interior ministerJan Hamacek told reporters. The government also ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for people coming to the Czech Republic from 15 'risk countries' with the exception of transit travellers. These countries are China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Belgium, Britain, Denmark and France. In France, schools and universities will be shut until at least the Easter holidays, education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told French radio today. Health minister Olivier Veran said that the schools would be closed for 'as short a time as possible' but also for 'as long as is needed'. 'What we want is a massive applying of the brakes nationwide,' he told Europe 1 Radio today. French President Emmanuel Macron had announced the closures in address to the nation from the Elysee Palace last night where he urged older people to stay at home. 'We are just at the beginning of this crisis,' said Macron, 42. 'In spite of all our efforts to brake it, this virus is continuing to propagate and to accelerate.' Macron asked people older than 70, those who suffer chronic diseases, respiratory troubles, and the handicapped, 'to stay at home' as far as possible. 'They can, of course, leave home to do the shopping, to take some air, but they should limit their contacts as much as possible,' said the president. But Macron also announced that nationwide local elections scheduled for Sunday will not be postponed. 'There is nothing to prevent the French, even the most vulnerable, from going to the ballot box' as long as people observe hygiene rules, he said. 'It is important at this time... to assure the continuity of our democratic life and that of our institutions,' said Macron. Public transport will not be interrupted, said Macron, 'because to stop it would be to block everything, including the possibility to provide health care' where needed. Disneyland Paris is closing on Sunday, along with the company's theme parks in California and Florida. Three workers at the Paris park were reported to have been infected. AUSTRIA Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has taken dramatic measures including quarantining two hard-hit areas of Tirol. He told reporters in Vienna that the towns of St Anton am Arlberg and the Paznauntal area would be isolated for 14 days, but added residents and tourists there now will be taken care of. Businesses are being asked to close from Monday, apart from those providing essential services such as supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, post offices and pharmacies. Bars and cafes can stay open until 3pm. GREECE The Greek Olympic committee says it is suspending the rest of its torch relay because of 'unexpectedly large crowd' that gathered to watch despite repeated requests to stay away to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Hellenic Olympic Committee said a large crowd had gathered to watch the flame for the Tokyo Olympics pass through the southern town of Sparta. The flame had been lit yesterday at the birthplace of the games in Ancient Olympia in a scaled-back ceremony. The handover of the Olympic Flame to the Tokyo organising committee will go ahead as scheduled on March 19 at the stadium in Athens where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896. CZECH REPUBLIC The government said Czech citizens coming home from 15 countries that are considered risky will have to stay under quarantine for two weeks. The announcement also covers foreigners arriving from China, Iran, Korea, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Britain. FRANCE President Emmanuel Macron vowed that nationwide elections will go ahead this weekend, after France's number of cases jumped past 2,800, including 61 deaths. The virus is sure to dominate the process as voters choose mayors and tens of thousands of local officials in the first round of elections on Sunday. Voting stations are under orders to allow a one-metre gap between people in queues, and to provide soap, sanitising gel or disinfectant wipes for voting machines. Authorities advised voters to bring their own pen to sign the voting register. SPAIN Prime minister Pedro Sanchez said the government will declare a two-week state of emergency starting on Saturday. Mr Sanchez said Spain will 'mobilise all resources', including the military, to contain a sharp rise in cases. It comes after more than 60,000 people were confined to four towns in Spain's first mandatory lockdown. The situation in and around the capital Madrid has seen nearly 2,000 positive cases. The country had more than 4,200 cases by Friday afternoon and at least 120 deaths. The royal palace said King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have tested negative for Covid-19. The royal couple took the test on Thursday after the government confirmed the infection of equality minister Irene Montero, who had attended an event with the queen last week. Another cabinet member was also confirmed to be infected after all the panel was tested. BULGARIA Legislators voted unanimously to approve the government's proposal for a 30-day state of emergency across the country. Prime minister Boyko Borissov said this will allow the government to shut down schools, nurseries, universities, concert halls and nightclubs. He said parliament should vote on penalties for people ordered into quarantine who do not follow procedures. A ban will be imposed on travel to certain countries, and people from countries with a high rate of infections will be banned from entering the country. NORWAY Norway has reported its first death from the coronavirus. Prime minister Erna Solberg said 'an elderly person' died on Thursday in Oslo. King Harald V, members of the royal family and some government officials have been put in quarantine because they had travelled abroad in recent weeks. DENMARK Legislators passed a temporary law under which authorities can force people who are suspected of having the virus to undergo tests. The law also gives authorities the ability to ban access to public places and stores. The government has already closed all schools and daycare facilities and ordered government workers who do not perform critical functions to stay home for the next two weeks, Queen Margrethe has cancelled all events around her 80th birthday on April 16. ESTONIA Estonia has declared a state of emergency, meaning no events can take place in public areas. Prime minister Juri Ratas said: 'The state must be able to give citizens clear and if necessary mandatory instructions that would help to put a limit to the spread of the virus.' He said he understands the inconvenience, 'but what is at stake is not the protection of just people's health, but also lives'. Neighbouring Belgium will close schools, cancelled cultural events and shut down bars and restaurants, the government announced last night. Prime minister Sophie Wilmes unveiled the measures after a national security meeting last night, saying they would come into force tomorrow. 'This is not a lockdown,' Wilmes said. 'We want to avoid situations like Italy. These measures must prevent lockdowns.' The closure of schools at national level will be effective until April 3, the day before the Easter holidays, effectively keeping students out of school for a month. The government said that parents with no option for child care would be helped by authorities. This was an effort to avoid citizens resorting to retired people, the age group most vulnerable to the virus. 'The idea is not for children to be looked after by their grandparents,' she said. Beginning Saturday, only stores that provide essential services - such as pharmacies and grocery stores - will remain open under normal conditions. All other stores will remain open during the week, but closed at weekends. The government also asked Belgians to work from home as much as possible. Luxembourg also closed schools and is limiting visits to the elderly in hospitals and nursing homes, hoping to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 'Daily life is going to change and we will have to adapt,' Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said, announcing measures of a scale 'never seen before' in the Grand Duchy. Landlocked Luxembourg is home to only 600,000 people, but more than 200,000 commuters from Belgium, France and Germany cross its borders each day to come to work. Portugal has also closed schools, keeping children at home from Monday until just before Easter. The move will affect more than 1.6 million children and teenagers and remain in force until April 9, prime minister Antonio Costa said. Costa also announced a series of 'temporary' measures, including the closure of nightclubs and limiting visitors to retirement homes. Portugal has so far registered 78 cases and has cancelled events with more than 1,000 people in enclosed places and more than 5,000 in open areas. Malta has also shut down schools, with no flights leaving for France or Italy from the country's sole international airport today. Switzerland closed classrooms today and offered billions in aid to hard-hit businesses, with a 'state of necessity' declared in the Ticino region which borders Italy. close its schools in a bid to halt the spread of the new coronavirus, the government said Friday, adding that it would provide billions in aid to hard-hit businesses. 'The situation is difficult,' Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga told reporters, as the small Alpine country saw its number of positive tests balloon to over 1,000. Closing schools in Germany is a matter for the country's 16 states, at least 13 of which had done so by Friday afternoon. Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested that the Easter holidays could be brought forward if state governments decided to keep children at home. Merkel has called for non-essential events to be cancelled, going further than a previous demand to stop gatherings of more than 1,000 people. 'That is a call to all,' she said, noting that 'where possible, social contact must be avoided'. Bavarian governor Markus Soeder said the state is implementing strict restrictions on visits to hospitals, retirement homes and other facilities where people may be particularly vulnerable. Berlin has also offered companies 'unlimited'credit to keep them afloat during the coronavirus crisis, in a departure from its usually strict fiscal policies. Some 550billion euros (Â£488billion) in government-backed loans that was announced is just 'for starters', said Economy Minister Peter Altmaier. 'We promised that we will not fail because of a lack of money and political will. This means that no healthy company, no job should find themselves in trouble,' he said. Germany's count of coronavirus cases has now reached 2,369 including five deaths. The Bundesliga football season will be suspended from Tuesday until early April. Austria todaytightened its coronavirus response by announcing the closure of non-essential retail businesses, locking down two western communities and suspending flights to France, Spain and Switzerland. A day after revealing its first virus-related death, Vienna said that non-essential retail businesses must be shuttered from Monday and that cafes and restaurants would shut every day at 3pm. In Spain, four towns in Catalonia were put under quarantine in the first such move in the country. The 66,000 inhabitants of the localities of Igualada, Odena, Santa Margarida de Montbui and Vilanova del Cami 'cannot leave their urban core' although they can leave their homes, a statement said. Catalonia's health minister Alba Verges told reporters that the authorities would be focussing on Igualada, a town of 40,000 inhabitants just 40 miles from Barcelona. Catalan police were blocking cars trying to leaveIgualada on a motorway this morning. Meanwhile, Poland recorded its first virus death yesterday after a 57-year-old teacher died in the city of Poznan. The woman had been taken to hospital in a critical condition with pneumonia, Poznan deputy mayorJedrzej Solarski said. The woman's husband and daughter are among those in hospital with coronavirus but their conditions are not critical. Other family members, including the woman's two sons, have not been infected. 'What we feared over the last few days has come about. We have our first death from the coronavirus,' Polish President Andrzej Duda told reporters. 'I offer my condolences to her close ones.' Poland currently has 46 other confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the health ministry. Italy is already four days into a nationwide quarantine that has left streets empty with bars and restaurants shut and most shops ordered to close. Rome is now shutting down all its Catholic churches with worshippers exempted from attending Sunday Mass. The shutdown was announced by the Pope's deputy in Rome last night as Italy's death toll passed 1,000 in the worst outbreak outside China. Cardinal Angelo De Donatis said Rome's 900 churches will be closed until at least April 3, when Italy's nationwide quarantine is due to end. The Vatican has already shut down St Peter's Square, St Peter's Basilica and the Vatican museums to tourists with weddings and funerals called off. But the total church closure is thought to be unprecedented. Some places of worship keeping their doors open even during World War II when the Nazis and Italian fascists kept Pope Pius XII confined to the Vatican. The cardinal's statement said access to 'churches of the Diocese of Rome open to the public - and more generally to religious buildings of any kind open to the public - is forbidden to all the faithful'. The statement added that monasteries would remain open to 'communities that habitually use them as residents'. 'This provision is for the common good,' De Donatis wrote. The cardinal said he was finally moved to close Rome's churches by 'the even more binding restrictions placed on the ordinary movement of people'. The Pope himself has been kept away from the public since he appeared to have a cold during an Ash Wednesday service last week. Pope Francis has been appearing via a Vatican live-stream and has complained of feeling 'caged'. The 83-year-old was forced to miss his weekly Wednesday appearance on St Peter's Square where he often hugs and shake hands with the faithful. The pontiff also had to read his traditional Sunday Angelus Prayer into a camera instead of his usual window overlooking the square. The national quarantine is in place until at least April 3, but top health official Walter Ricciardi told Italian TV yesterday that his countrymen should prepare for a 'long war'. Italy's government has also announced plans to boost the economy with extra spending, with particular fears for the tourist industry. Medical supplies from China arrived at Rome's Fiumicino Airport last night after they were flown from Shanghai - with Beijing now exporting its knowledge of handling the virus. Time is running out for Britons to return home from Italy with the last flights leaving tonight and neighbours shutting their borders. Austria has ordered a halt to flights and trains from Italy while Slovenia has begun imposing controls at its border with the country. Elsewhere, truck drivers have been waiting in long queues at the Slovenia-Croatia border with extra checks taking place because of the outbreak. Europe-wide sports events have also been affected with several Champions League and Europa League games taking place behind closed doors this week. There are growing calls for Euro 2020, which is due to take place across the continent, to be postponed until next year. A delay could also allow disrupted football seasons to finish over the summer, it has been suggested. Britain has yet to announce any drastic quarantine measures, although schools have been told to cancel foreign trips and older people advised against cruise voyages. Boris Johnsonsaid further measures were likely in the coming weeks, including the possibility of cancelling mass gatherings such as sporting events. Football authorities took matters into their own hands today by suspending the Premier League season until early April. Mr Johnson insisted yesterday that scientists were advising against school closures, despite similar shutdowns in neighbouring Ireland. 'Schools should only shut if they are specifically advised to do so,' the PM told reporters in Downing Street yesterday. The government is also fearful of public 'fatigue' of tougher restrictions before they are needed most. 'This is going to be a long haul. It is very important we do not start things in advance of need,' Mr Johnson said at the Number 10 press conference."
14,The Masters is OFF! Golf's first major of the year postponed due to coronavirus a month before Tiger Woods was due to defend his title,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-8109497/The-Masters-organisers-confirm-prestigious-tournament-postponed.html,"The Masters has been postponed, its organisers have confirmed, with the world of sport rocked by the ongoing spread of coronavirus. In a statement released online, Fred Ridley, Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, emphasised that the decision makers hope to hold the prestigious tournament 'at some later date'. The first men's major championship of the year was due to begin on April 9 in Georgia, but has been suspended due to the escalating pandemic. No new date has been announced. Golf's top major dates back to 1934, and has historically never taken place outside of March or April. This is its first postponement since World War II. But the sporting calendar has been thrown into disarray this week due to the health crisis, with countless events placed on hold as governments attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus. And the long-standing tournament soon followed suit on Friday afternoon, with questions now lingering over when the blue riband event will be able to be contested. Tiger Woods remains the defending Masters champion, having memorably won his fifth tournament at Augusta National last April. The Augusta National Women's Amateur and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals will also be postponed. On Wednesday, March 4, we issued a memo stating that our plans to host the Masters Tournament, the Augusta National Women's Amateur and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals had not changed. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing risks associated with the widespread Coronavirus COVID-19 have led us to a decision that undoubtedly will be disappointing to many, although I am confident is appropriate under these unique circumstances. Considering the latest information and expert analysis, we have decided at this time to postpone the Masters Tournament, the Augusta National Women's Amateur and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals. Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision. We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date. We will continue to work with the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office of the Governor, the Georgia Department of Public Health, the City of Augusta and all other local authorities. We are grateful to all of these entities for their exceptional efforts and guidance. We recognize this decision will affect many people, including our loyal patrons. Your patience as we make every effort to communicate effectively and efficiently is appreciated, and we will share any additional information as soon as it becomes available. Updates also will be posted to our website, Masters.com. As COVID-19 continues to impact the lives of people everywhere, we seek your understanding of this decision and know you share our concern given these trying times.

15,Boston Marathon is postponed until September 14 amid virus concerns rather than cancelling the event that generates $211 million annually,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109603/Boston-Marathon-postponed-Sept-14-amid-virus-concerns.html,"Organizers of the Boston Marathon, the planet's most celebrated footrace, are postponing the event until September 14 because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced Friday. The Patriots Day event has never been canceled outright since its first running in 1897, though there was a de facto cancellation in 1918, when the end of World War I and a global influenza pandemic prompted organizers to switch to a relay race format. Until Friday, not even the Great Depression or ferocious storms had interrupted the 124-year-old race, a bucket list quest for runners worldwide. About a third of this year's field were from outside the U.S. The Boston Athletic Association, which oversees the marathon, had held off deciding the fate of the April 20 race even as other high-profile sporting events were canceled or postponed around the globe. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO But pressure had mounted in recent weeks from officials in Boston and the seven cities and towns along the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) course. Some had expressed worries not only for the health of the 31,000 registered runners but also the estimated 1 million spectators who traditionally line the route, giving athletes hand slaps, high fives and even kisses as they pass. 'We want to make sure that we keep people safe,' the mayor said at a news conference. He stressed that people shouldn't attempt to run the race course in April when the marathon would have taken place, as some in the running community have suggested. President Donald Trump's order restricting most Europeans' travel to the United States over the coronavirus complicated efforts to salvage the race. Thousands of runners come from Europe to compete at Boston. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. Officials acknowledged postponing the race is a big undertaking but that canceling it outright would have been even more harmful. Walsh had said the marathon pumps $211 million a year into the city's economy - not counting the millions more that runners raise for charities. 'It won't look right on the calendar,' said Gov. Charlie Baker. 'But it's the right thing to do.' Baker has already declared a state of emergency, and race organizers had said they were in close contact with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. In recent days, the Rome Marathon was canceled, the Paris Marathon was postponed from April 5 to October 18 and the Barcelona Marathon was postponed from March 15 to October 25, all over concerns around COVID-19. This month's Tokyo Marathon was expected to have 38,000 participants but was limited to elite runners due to concerns over the outbreak of the virus in Japan. And spectators at the Los Angeles Marathon, held earlier this month, were advised to practice social distancing. Walsh said there was never a consideration to run the race with a limited field of elite runners. 'That's not the Boston Marathon. We're an inclusive marathon,' he said. 'The Boston Marathon is for everyone.'"
16,"Ohio probably has more than 100,000 undiagnosed cases of coronavirus because of 'community spread' - despite official tally of just five, warns state health department expert",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108389/Ohio-probably-100-000-undiagnosed-cases-coronavirus-community-spread.html,"Ohio has estimated it has more than 100,000 undiagnosed cases of coronavirus, after the virus was detected in people that had not traveled to affected areas. The state's director of health, Dr Amy Acton, who is also a licensed physician, warned the virus was moving through the population via 'community spread' as state governors moved to close all schools from Kindergaten to K-12 on Monday. The northern state, which has a population of 11.7million, has only reported five cases of COVID-19 so far. Two have contracted the virus via 'community spread'. Warning of the rapid spread of the disease from the Ohio General Assembly in Columbus yesterday, Dr Acton said: 'I know it is hard to understand COVID-19 since we can't see it, but we know that one per cent of our population is carrying this virus today. That's more than 100,000 people. 'I know it is very hard for us to get our heads around this and we're all waking up to this new reality. The steps we are taking now will absolutely save lives'. Governor Mike DeWine's office and the Department of Health has warned cases will double every six days, reports News 5 Cleveland. 'Whenever you know of two people that have it due to community spread, then you can assume that one per cent of your population has it,' they said, citing a 2017 morbidity and mortality weekly report from the CDC. Three of Ohio's cases are in Cuyahoga County, on the shores of Lake Erie, one is in Stark County, in the north-east, and one, detected in a 55-year-old man, is in Trumbull county, on the state's border with Pennysylvania. Health officials are currently investigating 52 people and have 333 under supervision. As many as 30 of those tested have come back with negative results. Announcing emergency measures to limit the spread of the virus yesterday, Governor Mike DeWine said: 'At the close of school on Monday is when the school closure starts until April 3. 'This order includes all public, community and private K-12 schools in the state, but does not apply to Ohio's childcare system such as daycare centers and home-based childcare providers. 'During this extended period of closure, schools should work to provide education through alternative means.' The governor has also recommended businesses start allowing staff to work from home where this is possible, and has banned gatherings of more than 100 people in a single room or space. The US has reported 1,758 cases of coronavirus so far, and 41 deaths, although this is expected to significantly increase in the coming days. New York has recorded 327 cases, the highest number in the country, followed by California, which has 241 cases and has announced four deaths. President Donald Trump suspended flights from China at the start of the outbreak and, on Wednesday, suspended flights from Europe as Italy went into lock-down and several countries in the EU reported more than 1,000 cases. Flights from the UK and Ireland to the US are still permitted. Empty streets have also been pictured in Disneyland California, Seattle, Washington and San Francisco as Americans crowd into supermarkets to stock up on essentials."
17,Leaked government records reveal 'the first coronavirus case emerged in Hubei in NOVEMBER' - two months before the province went into lockdown,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108951/Leaked-government-records-reveal-coronavirus-case-emerged-Hubei-NOVEMBER.html,"The first case of a person suffering from the new coronavirus can be traced back to November 17 in the Chinese province of Hubei, according to government records leaked to media. The date is more than seven weeks before Chinese officials announced they had identified a new virus and over two months before various cities in the region went into lockdown to contain the spread of the bug. Beijing claims the first coronavirus patient fell ill on December 7. Unpublished data show Chinese authorities have identified at least 266 people who were infected before December 31 â€“ a time when Wuhan authorities were busy punishing a group of doctors for sounding the alarm of a 'SARS-like' disease. The classified document, obtained by South China Morning Post, comes as coronavirus fears spread across Europe after cases in Italy, Spain and France spiked. It also comes as China and the United State spar over the origin of the killer virus. The contagion, officially known as COVID-19, has killed more than 4,900 people globally and escalated into a pandemic this week. According to the report, a 55-year-old resident of Hubei could have been the first person to have contracted the infection on November 17. However, no evidence shows that the individual is the 'patient zero', a term used to describe the first carrier of an infectious disease in an outbreak. The report added that between one and five new cases were reported each day from that date onwards. It is said the first double-digit daily toll occurred on December 17 and by the last day of 2019, the total number of infections had soared to 266 â€“ before it spiked again by 115 on January 1. But it wasn't until January 7 that the Chinese authorities declared they had identified a new virus. Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced on the day that the virus belonged to the coronavirus family, which includes SARS and the common cold. It was named 2019-nCoV. Before that, online warnings about the deadly disease, including posts from late whistle-blower doctor Li Wenliang, were branded as 'rumour' and 'fake news' by police of Wuhan. In late January, Beijing's experts said tests had proved that humans caught the virus from animals sold as food at the Huanan Seafood Wholesales Market in Wuhan. Previously, the 'patient zero' of the coronavirus was believed to be a bed-bound Wuhan pensioner who had no connection to the food market. The unnamed manin his 70s fell ill on December 1 and had not been to the seafood market before falling ill, a doctor told BBC. The claim echoes a report written by a group of Chinese doctors and published on peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet. The study from late January reveals critical information that had never been released by the Chinese government. In signs of a new diplomatic spat, China and the United States have been blaming each other as the alleged origin of the killer infection. A Beijing spokesperson yesterday claimed that the coronavirus might have been brought to Wuhan by the US military while US politicians called it the 'Wuhan virus' or 'Chinese coronavirus'. The spat comes as China tries to deflect blame for the contagion and reframe itself as a country that took decisive steps to buy the world time by placing huge swathes of its population under quarantine. With cases falling in China and soaring abroad, Beijing is now rejecting the widely held assessment that the city of Wuhan is the birthplace of the outbreak. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian went a step further on Thursday, saying on Twitter that 'it might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan' - without providing any evidence. He doubled down on his claim on Friday by posting a link to an article from a website known for publishing conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks. Censors usually vigilant against rumours have also allowed Chinese social media users to spread similar claims about the US being behind the virus. The push to question the origin of the disease contradicts China's own initial assessment about the source of the virus, which has now killed nearly 5,000 people worldwide. Gao Fu, head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January 'we now know the source of the virus is wild animals sold at the seafood market' in Wuhan. Chinese authorities themselves saw Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province as a threat as they placed the region of 56 million people under strict quarantine to contain the epidemic. But Beijing began sowing doubts in late February, when Zhong Nanshan, a respected expert affiliated with the National Health Commission, told reporters 'the epidemic first appeared in China, but didn't necessarily originate in China'. Scientists, however, have long suspected that the virus jumped from an animal at the Wuhan market to a human before spreading globally. The World Health Organization has said that while the exact path the virus took between its animal source and humans is still unclear, COVID-19 was 'unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019'. Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology at Imperial College London, said genetic analysis of coronavirus samples collected from around the world showed a common ancestor in China. 'This is not in any way blaming a particular country,' she told AFP.  A video showing a US health official saying some flu victims were posthumously diagnosed as having had COVID-19 was among the top searched items on China's Twitter-like Weibo this week, with some users saying it was evidence the virus originated in the US. Zhao posted the clip on Twitter. Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said he believed Zhao was 'tweeting in his official capacity'. China's intention in promoting the conspiracy theory is 'to divert from domestic discontent' over the handling of the outbreak, which has killed more than 3,170 people in the country. Asked if Zhao was representing the government's view, fellow foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Friday that 'the international community, including (people) in the United States, have different views on the source of the virus'. 'China from the beginning thinks this is a scientific issue, and that we need to listen to scientific and professional advice,' Geng said. The United States, meanwhile, has angered China by using language directly linking the virus to the country. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called it the 'Wuhan virus', prompting Beijing to reject the term as 'despicable' and 'disrespecting science'. While Kevin McCarthy, a US congressman, called the virus the 'Chinese coronavirus' on Twitter. In a tweet on Monday, he wrote: 'Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus can be found on one, regularly-updated website.' He was sharing the link to the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. US President Donald Trump started a televised address to his nation on Wednesday by speaking about the outbreak 'that started in China'. The language is 'part of his dog-whistling politics', said Australian National University researcher Yun Jiang. The WHO warns against naming infectious diseases in a way that encourages discrimination against ethnic groups. Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser, on Wednesday insisted that the virus originated in Wuhan. Blaming the pandemic on a lack of cooperation from Chinese officials and a cover-up when the outbreak first emerged, O'Brien said this had 'cost the world community two months to respond' to the threat. Beijing called his remarks 'extremely immoral and also irresponsible'. Jiang said that 'by sowing doubts into people's mind about where the virus originated, they're trying to deflect part of the blame for the outbreak'."
18,JetBlue BANS passenger from flying with airline after he took a flight from JFK knowing he was waiting for a coronavirus test result that then came back positive on boardÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108251/JetBlue-BANS-passenger-flying-tested-positive-coronavirus-onboard.html,"JetBlue has banned a passenger from flying with them again after he boarded a plane knowing he was waiting for coronavirus test results which came back positive during his journey. The man got a text confirming his diagnosis after he boarded the flight from John F Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Palm Beach International Airport, Florida, on Wednesday. Vast swathes of the country are shutdown as the US confirmed 1,700 cases and 41 deaths from the killer bug. The plane's 114 passengers were forced to remain on Flight 253 for two additional hours while they were given instructions on what procedures should be taken. The infected man and his wife were taken off from the back of the plane. An airline spokesman told The New York Poston Thursday: 'In reviewing last nightâ€™s event, we determined the customer boarded our flight knowing he was awaiting results for a coronavirus test without disclosing it to anyone at JetBlue. He added: 'Last nightâ€™s event put our crewmembers, customers and federal and local officials in an unsettling situation that could have easily been avoided, and as such, this customer will not be permitted to fly on JetBlue in the future.' Footage taken at the time shows aFlorida health official telling passengers that they were 'free to walk around and move around' after the man tested positive. Dr. Alina Alonso instructed the passengers to monitor themselves, highlighting how anyone who feels sick will need to contact the appropriate entities. 'At this point, you're free to walk around and move around because most likely you are not going to have anything because there was no activity,' she said in footage obtained by Pix11. 'The way you get this virus is someone has to cough or sneeze on you.'  Alonso then asks the passengers if the man had coughed or sneezed on anyone, to which several people could be heard exclaiming 'no.' A man can be heard asking Alonso if they can go 'out,' to which she responds that she is not telling them to stay 'home.' Another passenger on the plane claimed the man's wife told him they had been told of the result before take off. The flight landed at 8.53pm and passengers were allowed off the aircraft at 10.45pm, Palm Beach County Fire Rescue explained to WPTV. 'The person across the way from me was taken to the back of the plane,' passenger Scott Rodman said. 'He was wearing masks and gloves. His wife was sitting in the same row as me and mentioned to others that he wasn't feeling well. 'She said he had gotten a phone call with his test results right before we had taken off, implying that he had a positive test but not actually saying it.' Agents with the Florida Department of Health in Palm Beach County assessed the situation and spoke with all the passengers aboard the aircraft. Passengers who had been in close proximity with the man were also advised of monitoring procedures and given instructions of how to get in contact with the health department if they had any issues. The airport is sterilizing the area where the passengers deplaned, adding that it was in a separate area than the main terminals of the airport. There are already more than 1,400 cases of the virus in the US and 38 people have died."
19,Chinese spokesman accuses the US military of bringing coronavirus to Wuhan as war of words escalates after Trump's national security adviser accused Beijing of cover up,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8105527/China-government-spokesman-says-U-S-military-bought-virus-China.html,"A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry suggested on Thursday the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been hardest hit by the outbreak, doubling down on a war of words with Washington. China has taken great offence at comments by U.S. officials accusing it of being slow to react to the virus, first detected in Wuhan late last year, and of not being transparent enough. On Wednesday, U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said the speed of China's reaction to the emergence of the coronavirus had probably cost the world two months when it could have been preparing for the outbreak. In a strongly worded tweet, written in English on his verified Twitter account, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it was the United States that lacked transparency. 'When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!' Zhao wrote. Zhao, an avid and often combative Twitter user, did not offer any evidence for his suggestion that the U.S. military might be to blame for the outbreak in China. Earlier on Thursday, Zhao's fellow Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang criticised U.S. officials for 'immoral and irresponsible' comments that blamed Beijing's response to the coronavirus for worsening the global impact of the pandemic. Asked about O'Brien's comments, Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing on that such remarks by U.S. officials would not help U.S. epidemic efforts. China's efforts to slow the spread had bought the world time to prepare against the epidemic, he added. 'We wish that a few officials in the U.S. would at this time concentrate their energy on responding to the virus and promoting cooperation, and not on shifting the blame to China.' The coronavirus emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, where around two-thirds of global cases so far have been recorded. But in recent weeks the vast majority of new cases have been outside China. The Chinese authorities credit firm measures they took in January and February, including to a near total shutdown of Hubei, for preventing outbreaks in other Chinese cities on the scale of Wuhan and slowing the spread abroad. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has pointed to a decision to limit air travel from China at the end of January to fend off criticism that it responded too slowly to the disease. Critics say Trump played down the disease in public and the federal government was slow to roll out tests. 'Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,' Trump's national security advisor O'Brien said during a think-tank appearance on Wednesday. 'It probably cost the world community two months to respond,' during which 'we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world', he said. More than 119,100 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus across the world and 4,298 have died, the vast majority in China, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has 975 cases and 30 people have died. 'We have done a good job responding to it but ... the way that this started out in China, and the way it was handled from the outset, was not right,' said O'Brien.

20,"China's richest man Jack Ma donates one million face masks and 500,000 coronavirus test kits to the US as Beijing and Washington accuse each other of being the origin of the disease",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8105199/Chinas-richest-man-Jack-Ma-donates-one-million-face-masks-500-000-test-kits-US.html,"China's richest man is donating one million face masks and 500,000 coronavirus test kits to the United States to help the world's largest economy fight the outbreak, which has killed at least 5,000 people worldwide. The tycoon's aid comes as Beijing and Washington spar over the origin of the deadly disease, known as COVID-19. Jack Ma, worth Â£31.6billion, announced the decision on Friday through his account on Twitter-like Weibo. Ma, the founder of e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba, said he managed to gather the supplies today and would immediately send them out 'as donations to the American people'. He continued: 'Based on the counter-epidemic experience we have gained in the past months, quick and accurate test solution and protective equipment for medical workers are the key goods to stop the epidemic from escalating. 'Hopefully, these supplies can help some people in the United States. 'This is a big epidemic challenge faced by mankind in an era of globalisation. To this day, it is no longer a challenge any country can overcome by itself, but one that all of us need to face together hand-in-hand. 'Right now, only when we share resources without judgement and exchange counter-epidemic experience and lessons can we have the chance to defeat this disaster.' The self-made billionaire, who used to be an English teacher, concluded his post by writing in English: 'United we stand, divided we fall!' The 55-year-old magnate has already donated millions of masks and test kits to Japan, South Korea, Iran and Europe to support their containment of the fast-spreading contagion. Earlier this week, Ma announced he was donating 1.8million face masks and 100,000 coronavirus test kits to Europe. The supplies were set to be shared between the European nations that have been hit by the disease the hardest, including Italy and Spain, he said. Last week, Ma mailed 1million masks to Japan and South Korea respectively, according to Jack Ma Charity Foundation. The two neighbouring countries of China are also being ravaged by the contagion. In January, he donated 100million yuan (Â£11million, $14.4million) to help scientists develop vaccines for the coronavirus. In signs of a new diplomatic spat, China and the United States have been blaming each other as the alleged origin of the killer infection. A Beijing spokesperson yesterday claimed that the coronavirus might have been brought to Wuhan by the US military while US politicians called it the 'Wuhan virus' or 'Chinese coronavirus'. The spat comes as China tries to deflect blame for the contagion and reframe itself as a country that took decisive steps to buy the world time by placing huge swathes of its population under quarantine. With cases falling in China and soaring abroad, Beijing is now rejecting the widely held assessment that the city of Wuhan is the birthplace of the outbreak. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian went a step further on Thursday, saying on Twitter that 'it might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan' - without providing any evidence. He doubled down on his claim on Friday by posting a link to an article from a website known for publishing conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks. Censors usually vigilant against rumours have also allowed Chinese social media users to spread similar claims about the US being behind the virus. A video showing a US health official saying some flu victims were posthumously diagnosed as having had COVID-19 was among the top searched items on China's Twitter-like Weibo this week, with some users saying it was evidence the virus originated in the US. Zhao posted the clip on Twitter. Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said he believed Zhao was 'tweeting in his official capacity'. China's intention in promoting the conspiracy theory is 'to divert from domestic discontent' over the handling of the outbreak, which has killed more than 3,170 people in the country.

21,"Spain declares state of emergency, with military brought in to contain coronavirus as Ibiza, Majorca and Costa Blanca region close all pubs and clubsÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109441/Ibiza-Majorca-close-pubs-clubs-drastic-coronavirus-measures.html,"Around 500,000 people are being placed on lockdown in Murcia's coastal region including the popular Brit tourist area of La Manga because of the coronavirus crisis. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed a state of emergency during a press conference today and said he will deploy the military to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, regional government chiefs are issuing an emergency order limiting freedom of movement in seven coastal municipalities for the next fortnight. The order is set to lead to the closure of discos, bars and restaurants. Bars and restaurant closures in resorts like Benidorm, as well as other holiday hotspots along the Costa Blanca, will come into effect at midnight tonight. The order covers the whole of the Valencian community which includes the provinces of Castellon, Valencia and Alicante. Benidorm is part of the province of Alicante. A statement from the regional government said: 'The closure of bars and restaurants, shows and public and private sports centres comes into effect from midnight tonight.' Karen Maling Cowles, president of the Benidorm British Business Association, said this afternoon the word was still getting round to owners of bars and other nightspots in the famous resort that they would have to close at midnight and remain shut for the next fortnight. She said: 'The regional government order doesn't covers things like chemists and garages but it covers cafes, restaurants, bars and other businesses like gyms, basically all places where you get people congregating for leisure reasons. 'It's all happened very suddenly and I think it's hit people in the face very suddenly. 'Everywhere in Spain is going to be in the same situation very shortly. 'I'm telling people we're all going to be in the same boat and we can rebuild ourselves. 'It's important to stick together and not fight or bicker but help each other as much as we can. 'I am concerned for young people who are living here day to day, people who don't have contacts that depend on their money. 'They're my concern in terms of the local community. 'And in terms of the holidaymakers, there's going to be a lot of people who are twiddling their thumbs tonight. 'Lock-ins are banned and bars who organise them will be fined. 'People are still receiving the message now about the closure and I am taking calls from people wanting to check if it affects them. 'The word is still getting around because it's happening so fast. It's really hitting people in the face today.' She added: 'I would urge holidaymakers who are out and about tonight to respect the closure orders when they come in. 'The police are going to enforce them. I am sure people will understand this is a public order emergency and cooperate with what the authorities are telling them they must do.' Bars in Benidorm were busy this afternoon ahead of the closure order coming into effect. Tourist Mike Jarman, from Birmingham, on his way to meet friends for a boozy afternoon, said: 'I'm on the second day of my holiday. 'It was meant to be a week of fun away with some mates but this is going to change everything. 'If I had known it was going to be this bad I would never have come.' Police checkpoints are now due to be set up to stop the free movement of people into or out of the lockdown areas, which include the municipality of San Javier covering La Manga. No-one was immediately available for comment at one of the best-known resorts in the area, the La Manga Club Resort, to explain the order's practical effects for British tourists already staying there and those scheduled to check in. Murcia's regional government announced the measure today after the massive arrival of Spaniards from higher risk areas include Madrid. It came after Glamorgan announced it had called off their pre-season tour of La Manga because of the coronavirus crisis. They were scheduled to fly out on March 19. Four towns in the province of Barcelona were placed on lockdown on Thursday night. Spanish PM Pedro Gonzalez put Spain on a state of alarm this afternoon, enabling the government to restrict peoples' freedom of movement and ration the consumption of necessity goods. Closure orders affecting bars, restaurants and cafes were also announced today for the Valencian Community, which covers Costa Blanca resorts like Benidorm. They will have to close from tonight under the terms of the regional government decree, along with museums, theatres and libraries. COVID-19 has already infected over 4,000 people in Spain and caused 120 deaths. PM Gonzalez's decision will allow for decision-making to be centralised and for population movement to be limited. The state of emergency, which Sanchez said will formally be decided by a cabinet meeting on Saturday, will give the government power to take wide-ranging measures including temporarily occupying factories or any other premises except private homes. He did not spell out what specific measures the government will take. Schools have already shut down across the country, with many cinemas, theatres or playgrounds also closing and trials suspended in several regions as normal life came to a halt in the euro zone's fourth-largest economy. Sanchez said the number of cases in Spain could jump to over 10,000 as early as next week but added he was confident the country would defeat the virus, urging all citizens to do their part. It is the second time the state of emergency has been enforced in Spain. The first time was in 2010, with the air traffic controller crisis. SÃ¡nchez said the order was for 15 days. He has asked the whole of Spain to follow expert to stop the virus from spreading. 'The heroism is about washing one's hands and staying at home. It will take weeks, it will be difficult and but we will overcome this emergency,' he said. The comments, delivered at a press conference earlier today, come shortly after Britons were warned against 'all but essential travel' to Madrid and some other parts of Spain. Ibiza and Majorca will close all pubs and clubs as part of a series of 'drastic' measures intended to halt the spread of the coronavirus. The Balearic Government today ordered the closure of all discos, clubs, pubs, nightclubs, gyms and sports facilities, casinos and game rooms in Mallorca and Ibiza. It has also ordered bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas to reduce their capacity by at least a third. There are currently 26 cases of coronavirus in the Balearics and there has been one death, a woman in her 60s who already had underlying health problems. President, Francina Armengol acknowledged the measures are 'drastic' in a community where the 'incidence is low' - 0.8 per cent of the total in Spain - but assured that, with them, the community would come out of the health crisis. She says 'sacrifices' have to be made and has asked for the population to stay at home for the next 15 days. 'We are closing all the places where we believe there can be agglomerations,' she told a press conference this lunchtime. Discos and clubs will have to close for at least a fortnight, after which there will be a further review. All large events have been suspended and school cancelled. 'Individual responsibility is essential. Each measure of individual protection we take is an advance in the containment of the virus, ' said the Balearic president. 'We know that the health crisis is serious, and we know that the economic impact will be important, but we can be sure that if we all act with the maximum responsibility we will be able to contain the virus in the coming weeks and we will be able to advance the recovery of economic and social normality. ' One of the most popular clubs in Mallorca, Tito's in Palma, has formally announced its temporary closure due to coronavirus. The management said this would be temporary and reopening will depend on the evolution of the disease. It has stressed that the decision has been taken for purely health reasons and that no member of staff has contracted the virus. Spain's coronavirus death toll spiked by 50 per cent to 120 today and infections have soared to 4,200. The Foreign Office said Britons should scrap unnecessary visits to the regions of Madrid and La Rioja and the municipalities of La Bastida, Vitoria and Miranda de Ebro. As of 1200 GMT, there were 4,209 cases in Spain, up from 3,004 on Thursday evening, when the number of deaths had stood at 84. Madrid and La Rioja and the municipalities of La Bastida, Vitoria and Miranda de Ebro, have been designated by Spanish authorities as 'areas of community transmission'. Britons who are currently in Spain are not being advised to leave, because flights and other transport routes are still running. Airlines are still running flights to and from the areas in question, the Foreign Office said. However, the Spanish government has suspended all incoming flights from Italy until March 25 and asked people to avoid unnecessary travel. 'People intending to travel to Spain should consult their airlines and tour operators,' the UK government advice says. The region of Madrid is one of 17 autonomous communities in Spain, and includes the capital city. The community ofLa Rioja, also designated as a virus hotspot, is further north and includes the cities of Logrono and Calahorra. La Bastida and Miranda de Ebro are in the north-westernCastile and Leon region, while Vitoria is in the Basque country. There is no advice against travelling to the rest of Spain, but officials are keeping the outbreak under review.  The FCO advice follows very similar guidance issued by Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney two days ago. Officials are already advising against all but essential travel to Italy, and urging tourists to try to return to the UK as soon as possible. That is becoming increasingly difficult with flights being scrapped and neighbouring countries closing their borders. Britons are also advised against non-essential travel to China and any travel at all to Hubei province at the centre of the outbreak. The FCO also advises against unnecessary travel to Iran, although that was the case already because of political tensions. There is no general advice against travel to South Korea, except for affected provinces. Separately, four towns in Catalonia were put under quarantine on Thursday in the first such move in the country. The 66,000 inhabitants of the localities of Igualada, Odena, Santa Margarida de Montbui and Vilanova del Cami 'cannot leave their urban core' although they can leave their homes, a statement said. Catalonia's health minister Alba Verges told reporters that the authorities would be focussing on Igualada, a town of 40,000 people around 40 miles from Barcelona. There are currently 58 cases in the town, 38 more than on Wednesday, the health minister said. Catalan police officers were blocking cars trying to leave Igualada on a road this morning. Spain's royal palace said yesterday that King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia had tested negative for Covid-19. The cabinet also underwent tests after the equalities minister tested positive and was quarantined with her partner, the second deputy prime minister. The infected minister,Irene Montero, had appeared at a mass march of some 120,000 people through Madrid for International Women's Day last Sundady.  "
22,"British Airways in battle for 'survival' over coronavirus: BA boss says the economic impact will be 'more serious than the financial crisis, SARS or 9/11'Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109405/BA-ground-aircraft-cut-staff-tackle-unprecedented-crisis.html,"British Airways today revealed coronavirus is threatening its survival as staff were told there will be job cuts and aircraft will be grounded because of the'worsening situation' after it was declared a global pandemic. Chief Executive Alex Cruz has written to all 45,000 workers saying the virus' relentless spread is a crisis 'of global proportions like no other we have known', more serious than the 2008 financial crash, SARS or 9/11. Mr Cruz warned people would be put out of work and planes would be grounded 'like we've never had to do before' and urged: 'Please do not underestimate the seriousness of this for our company' in a message entitled 'the survival of British Airways'. Cruz said that BA, which along with Iberia and Aer Lingus is part of the financially strong IAG, was more resilient 'than ever before' with a strong balance sheet. But the airline was under 'immense pressure' and would 'have to react fast and definitively in response to the worsening situation', he said. His letter to staff was leaked this afternoon - but despite the bad news it contained shares in BA's parent company jumped upwards 5 per cent this afternoon as investors reacted positively to news that the airline would be cutting costs. The chilling warning about BA's financial health came just eight days since the collapseof regional carrier Flybe who also blamed coronavirus for its demise after 18 months of cashflow problems. The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) today the Government must act immediately to support the UK airline industry, which is creaking under the pressure of the effects of coronavirus. Summer booking are significantly down, and as a result, airlines are scaling back operations and asking employees to take unpaid leave, freezing and pay and considering redundancies. BA has already been forced to cancel flights to mainland China, Italy and Spain to stop the spread - as have Ryanair, easyJet and other major carriers. Airlines around the globe are cutting flights and costs amid plunging demand with experts saying they will collectively lose $130billion this year. The industry is braced for further failures as no carrier is exempt from the short-term pain that has already seen British regional player Flybe collapse and Norwegian's stock lose about 80% of its value in a month. As a result, jobs would be lost 'perhaps for a short period, perhaps longer term' and the company was in discussions with trade unions, Cruz added. Aircraft would be grounded in a way that the airline has never had to do before, he said. A spokesman for BA, which is based at Heathrow in London, declined to comment when asked how many jobs could go. The airline employs 45,000 people. While Britain was exempt from U.S. travel restrictions announced on Thursday which will hit its continental European counterparts, it has already cancelled flights to the U.S. as well as Italy, China and South Korea. New British government advice warning against all but essential travel to parts of Spain on Friday could further hurt BA, which has 17 flights to Madrid daily, plus dozens to other Spanish cities. Shares in IAG traded up 8% to 355.8 pence in the hour after Cruz's warning over jobs, paring gains of as much as 14% earlier in the session. IAG's stock price has fallen by 42% in the last month. "
23,Revealed: How the coronavirus is deadliest for the over-80s and how patients with underlying health problems from heart disease and asthma are most vulnerableÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108907/How-coronavirus-deadliest-patients-underlying-health-problem.html,"Scientists have crunched coronavirus statistics to reveal the fatality rate for infected patients with underlying health problems. Data shows patients with pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer severe illness and die because their immune systems are weaker. Researchers in China, who studied more than 72,000 patients, found 10.5 per cent of heart disease sufferers who became ill with COVID-19 died. The fatality rate was 7.3 per cent for diabetics and 6.3 per cent among people with chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma. The World Health Organization has recently advised vulnerable people to be extra vigilant and avoid crowded areas, or anywhere they could come into contact with sick people. Cases have reached almost 800 in the UK, and ten people have died. But officials yesterday revealed up to 10,000 patients could already be infected. Boris Johnson warned 'many more will die' of the coronavirus in the UK, but just how many remains to be seen. The study did not break the data down into age brackets or gender for each condition. Therefore it is not known, for example, how a 55-year-old man with high blood pressure would fare compared with a 65-year-old woman with diabetes. The killer virus sweeping the globe can infect anybody, but those with more severe illness and those who ultimately die tend to be elderly or suffer from another underlying illness. Conditions Heart disease: 10.5% Diabetes: 7.3% Chronic respiratory disease: 6.3% High blood pressure: 6% Cancer: 5.6% None: 0.9% Ages 0-9 years: N/A 10-19 years: 0.2% 20-29 years: 0.2% 30-39 years: 0.2% 40-49 years: 0.4% 50-59 years: 1.3% 60-69 years: 3.6% 70-79 years: 8% Over 80 years: 14.8% People with compromised health aren't immediately guaranteed to become seriously unwell, they are just at a higher risk. Doctors and families have also reported deaths in people who were seemingly completely healthy before being infected. Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention researcherslooked at 72,314 confirmed, suspected, clinically diagnosed, and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 illness across China as of February 11. Results showed the overall case-fatality ratio â€“ the percentage of patients who die â€“ was just 2.3 per cent. But this jumps higher in those with underlying conditions and the elderly, according to the findingsin the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology. Those with heart disease fared worse - one in ten people studied died. This was followed by diabetics, who had a 7.3 per cent fatality rate (one in 13.6 people). Of those with chronic respiratory illnesses, one in 15.8 people died. Six per cent of people with high blood pressure (one in 16.6 people) died. The group with any form of cancer had a mortality rate of 5.6 per cent. Although COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that primarily affects the lungs, the body comes under enormous stress while trying to fight back. Those who have underlying conditions to begin with 'have less of a ""safety net"" to cope with the demands',Professor Naveed Sattar, an honorary consultant in cardiovascular and medical sciences, explained. He told MailOnline: 'If you are healthy, your buffer capacity is good. The rest of your body can cope with the stress. 'But if you have impairments to begin with, your systems break down.' In many patients with COVID-19, the lungs are unable to receive enough oxygen. This has a knock-on effect on other organs. Professor Sattar, at the University of Glasgow, explained the heart comes under a lot of strain trying to pump oxygenated blood around the body, including to the brain. Dr Hajira Dambha-Miller, a GP and clinical lecturer, saidthe blood is less able to circulate in people who have high blood pressure because their vessels are narrower. Not only does this slow the route of oxygen to organs, but it also means immune cells in the blood are not able to reach the virus as quickly as needed. 'If you've got diabetes', she said, 'you have high sugar levels and your blood becomes like treacle. 'Physically, its harder for the immune system to get to the virus. The virus bugs do a lot of damage before the immune system even realises it's there. 'When the body does kick in, it won't work as it should do. Theimmune cells are damaged because they've been saturated in sugar for years and don't work the way they should.' Dr Damnha-Miller said similar processes are impaired in the elderly. A separate group of virologists studying the coronavirus have also claimed it is up to 20 times more infectious than its sister SARS. But SARS is deadlier with a mortality rate of 10 per cent. Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention researchers also found 80.9 per cent of infections are mild. Less than five per cent are critical and needing hospital care."
24,Canadian PM Justin Trudeau becomes the first world leader to go into 14-day coronavirus ISOLATION as his wife tests positive for the virus following visit to the UK,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107589/Canadian-Prime-Minister-Justin-Trudeaus-wife-tests-positive-coronavirus.html,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauhas gone into isolation after hiswife Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau tested positive for coronavirus. Trudeau's office released a statement Thursday night confirming that the 44-year-old has tested positive for the virus a day after she reported feeling mild flu-like symptoms, including a low fever, on Wednesday night. 'She is feeling well, is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. Justin Trudeau, 48, is 'in good health' has no symptoms but will be in isolation for 14 days, according to the statement. He is the first world leader to go into isolation. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  He is not being tested at this time because he is asymptomatic. He is slated to address Canadians on Friday. Trudeau was also scheduled to hold meetings over the next two days and Ottawa with provincial premiers and First Nations leaders, but those meetings have been postponed, according to the BBC. Sophie Trudeau began to exhibit symptoms on Wednesday evening after returning to Canada from a trip to the UK where she attended the WE Day UK Charity event and concert in London last Tuesday March 3. Idris Elba, Jamie Oliver, race car driver Lewis Hamilton and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard were also present at the event. Sophie released a reassuring statement Thursday saying she's doing well despite experiencing 'uncomfortable symptoms'. 'First, Iâ€™d like to say a big thank you to all of you who have reached out to me asking how Iâ€™m doing. Although Iâ€™m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon. Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns. 'We will get through this situation together. Please share the facts and take your health seriously. 'I send you all my courage and warm thoughts (but only ""get better"" hugs from afar!)' she wrote. Health officials will reach out to those who've been in contact with her as necessary, the office said. After she felt ill, the Canadian Prime Minister's office released a statement saying she will get tested and she and her husband would be put in isolation. 'I have some personal news to share today. Sophie recently returned from a speaking event in the UK, and last night she was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. Sheâ€˜s feeling better, but following the advice of our doctor she is self-isolating as we wait on COVID-19 test results,' Trudeau tweeted Thursday afternoon. On Thursday despite being in isolation, it was a typical work day for Prime Minister Trudeau, who held virtual meetings and briefings from home. He spoke with world leaders - including President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Italian leaders - and joined a special Cabinet committee discussion on the new coronavirus.He cancelled an in-person meeting with Canadaâ€™s provincial premiers. On Thursday a meeting between Trudeau, the premiers and Indigenous leaders that was scheduled to begin in Ottawa has been postponed indefinitely due to the outbreak. The killer coronavirus already has a grip on Canada with 138 reported cases as of Thursday as per government data. On Wednesday, Trudeau announced $800million USD in new financial measures to help mitigate the effects of the widening coronavirus outbreak in Canada. Trudeau told a news conference that the money would help buy surgical equipment and fund research for a new vaccine. He also promised to make it easier for sick workers to claim employment insurance. Quebec premier Francois Legault, meanwhile, is asking all people returning from travel abroad to self-isolate for 14 days.The measure will be mandatory for all government employees. He is also asking organizers to cancel all indoor events attracting crowds of more than 250 people and all other large gatherings that are not considered essential. Alberta and British Columbia are also urging all events with more than 250 people be cancelled. Ontario, Canadaâ€™s most populous province, is closing schools until April 5. British Columbia Health Minister Adrian Dix says so farthere has not been widespread community transmission of the virus in Canada, unlike in the US. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready."
25,Miami's cop squad motorcycle team are in quarantine after escorting Brazilian president Bolsonaro to Mar-a-Lago as his press secretary tests positive for coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109135/Miamis-cop-squad-motorcycle-team-quarantine-escorting-Brazilian-president-Bolsonaro.html,"Miami police have placed their motorcycle team in quarantine after they escorted Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and his press secretary Fabio Wajngarten, who has tested positive for coronavirus. The 21-strong team, which accompanied the visitors to Mar-a-Lago, have been sent home for two weeks as they might have been 'in contact' with Mr Wajngarten or shaken his hand. Florida senator Rick Scott, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez have all self-quarantined following the visit. Donald Trump, 73, who was pictured standing next to Mr Wajngarten, has not announced that he is taking precautionary measures. Bolsonaro has been tested for the virus. The results are expected later today. 'It's out of an abundance of caution (that they have been isolated),' Miami police chief Jorge Colina told the Miami Herald. 'They were in contact during photo-ops or might have shaken hands.' No officers are said to be exhibiting signs of COVID-19. They will have their temperature checked during the quarantine in line with health department recommendations. The pair spent the night with President Trump on Saturday, and presented him with black-and-gold hats reading 'Make Brazil Great Again'. Bolsonaro also ate a dinner with the president and several esteemed guests including Trump's daughter Ivanka. The White House has said that both the President and the Vice President 'had almost no interaction' with Mr Wajngarten. 'They do not require being tested at this time,' they said. 'The White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service has been working closely with various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the First & Second Families, and all White House staff, healthy.' During their visit last weekend, Trump said he was 'not concerned at all' about the coronavirus outbreak. 'We did nothing very unusual, we sat next to each other for a period of time,' he said. The United States has so far reported 1,758 cases of the virus, with the number expected to rise significantly. There are 50 cases in Florida and two people have died due to the virus."
26,"'There is no crying in baseball': Tom Hanks shares a photo of him and wife Rita Wilson, quotes his A League Of Their Own character and says they are 'taking it one-day-at-a-time' after catching coronavirus",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8107629/Tom-Hanks-wife-Rita-Wilson-taking-one-day-time-testing-positive-coronavirus.html,"Tom Hanks might be in quarantine in Australia with his wife Rita Wilson after being diagnosed with coronavirus - but he's remaining upbeat by quoting a line from one of his famous roles. In an Instagram post, Hanks wrote: 'Hello folks. @ritawilson and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us.' 'We have Covid-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else. There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. The two-time Academy Award winner said he and his wife, both 63, 'are taking it one-day-at-a-time' amid the global health pandemic. In an accompanying shot, Tom wore a sage green cap with a grey shirt, while Rita wore a grey mesh cap with a pink top. He added, 'There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts and taking care of ourselves and each other, no?' In a tear-jerking line quoting his A League Of Their Own character Jimmy Dugan, he signed off in saying, 'Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball.' In the 1992 movie, the actor played the manager of a World War II-era female professional baseball team that included Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna and Geena Davis. Rita shared the same shot, adding, 'A little update below to all of you from@tomHanks and myself. So grateful for the outpouring of prayers, love and support. Means so much and strengthens us.' Among the notable names who responded to Wilson's post included her son Chet, 29, who wrote, 'Love you so much mom;' actress Kate Bosworth, who wrote, 'Love you;' and Kris Jenner, who responded, 'Praying for you and sending love to you both!!!' Other stars chiming in with kind words for the couple of 30 years included Naomi Campbell, Gwen Stefani, Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson. Rita took to her Twitter and told her followers: 'From here on out, the only Corona I want is from Mexico and you drink it.' Wilson later shared a screenshot of one of her musical tracks, The Wind, on her Instagram Stories. The father-of-four - to kids Colin, 42, Elizabeth, 37, with first wife Samantha Lewes; and Chet and Truman, 24, with Wilson - remains hospitalised with Wilson at Gold Coast University Hospital, where they are isolated and in stable condition. He took to social media Wednesday, shocking the world in revealing that he and his wife had 'slight fevers' and 'felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. 'To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.' The actor, whose iconic catalogue includes Forrest Gump, Big and Saving Private Ryan, kept his trademark optimism amid the health crisis. 'Well, now. What to do next?' he said. 'The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanksâ€™ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. 'Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?' More than 1,500 cases of the ailment have been reported, with officials expecting a spike when mass testing commences. It has affected all facets of the entertainment industry, as television programmes ranging from talk shows to game shows will proceed taping programmes without studio audiences on hand. Among the talk shows are The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Late Show With James Corden, while game shows such as Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! will also go on without audience members. In addition, films such as Fast & Furious 9 and The Quiet Place 2 have had their releases delayed amid an anticipated swoon at the box office amid the outbreak, while Disneyland in Anaheim, California was closed through the end of the month."
27,Germany offers companies 'unlimited' credit to tackle coronavirus in the biggest economic aid package in country's post-war history,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109663/Germany-offers-companies-unlimited-credit-tackle-coronavirus.html,"Germany has promised its companies the biggest economic aid package in the country's post-war history to help them cope with the impact of COVID-19. 'Unlimited' credit has been offered to keep the country's economy afloat during the ongoingcoronavirus outbreak. Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz reassured businesses during a press conference alongside the Minister of Economics and Energy Peter Altmaier today. Mr Scholz said: 'There is no upper limit to the credit offered by (state-owned development bank) KfW, that's the most important message.' Some â‚¬550 billion (Â£488 billion) in government-backed loans is just 'for starters', added Mr Altmaier. 'We promised that we will not fail because of a lack of money and political will. This means that no healthy company, no job should find themselves in trouble,' he said. 'We will reload our weapons if necessary,' added Altmaier. The ministers also signalled that Berlin has enough funds in its treasury for a long battle. 'If it lasts longer, we can go on longer,' said Scholz. 'You can be courageous, the risks will be carried by us.' The package, even in its first stage, is bigger than the â‚¬500 billion (Â£444 billion) offered by the German government during the 2008 financial crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed on Wednesday to do what it takes to tame the coronavirus crisis, signalling she was even ready to suspend the cherished dogma of keeping Germany's budget balanced. 'It is an extraordinary situation, we will do what's necessary and luckily Germany is relatively robust... we will do what we can to get through this situation well, and we will see at the end of that where our budget stands,' she said, stressing that ending the virus crisis 'comes first'. Germany has now recorded over 2,300 cases of the coronavirus and seven people have died, according to the latest tally by DPA news agency. As concern grows, Germany's regional states have one by one announced that schools, daycare centres and kindergartens would be closed from Monday. Among them were Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to some 18 million people, as well Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Berlin. Merkel's government has in recent days ramped up its response to fight not only the virus but also the impact of the contagion. With demand from abroad collapsing, Europe's biggest economy's vital export industries are particularly vulnerable. Germany is rushing through new regulations to allow more employees forced into shorter working hours to qualify for compensation. The government had also already agreed to boost investments by â‚¬3.1 billion per year between 2021 and 2024. The hike in investments totalling â‚¬12.4 billion will be entirely funded by 2019's budget surplus, the coalition had announced on Monday after overnight talks. Deka Bank chief economist Ulrich Kater said Friday's guarantee package is a 'whatever it takes from the government'. 'Like how the ECB acted correctly during the eurozone crisis, the government is now doing the same in the coronacrisis,' he noted, saying that the measures to help particularly small and medium-sized companies through the crisis are 'absolutely sensible'. 'This is just the news that can stop the downward spiral.'"
28,"America closes for business as Congress is warned 150MILLION will be infected with coronavirus: Highways and airports are deserted, DC is a ghost town and millions of people mob stores",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107427/America-shuts-Congress-warned-150MILLION-infected-coronavirus.html,"  Up to 150 million Americans could be infected with the coronavirus top doctors believe, a Congresswoman confirmed Thursday as vast swathes of the country shutdown and the national outbreak grew to over 1,700 cases and 41 deaths. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib confirmed earlier reports that Congress' doctorDr. Brian Monahan has told lawmakers that he predicts between 70 to 150 million people in the United States could eventually be infected with the novelcoronavirus. The startling figures were revealed as many public spaces, airports, streets and highways became deserted of people and cars Thursday evening and panicked shoppers rushed to buy supplies. Disney Parks and Capitol Hill were among the many places closed off to the public as Broadway also went dark. Dr. Monahan's prediction underscores how severe the outbreak could become in the U.S. as the White House continues to downplay the severity and asks the public to remain calm. Heoriginally shared the information with a closed-door meeting of Senate senior staff on Tuesday when they were told they should prepare for the worst. It comes as: CLOSED: The Capitol is shut to the public until April Disneyland and California Adventure theme parks close from Saturday Broadway went dark on Thursday as shows closed by 5pm and will remain suspended until April 12 CANCELED: The Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center, the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall all canceled events through March 31 SXSW March Madness is cancelled after Power 5 teams scrap tournaments The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) Nickelodeonâ€™s Kidsâ€™ Choice Awards DragCon LA NCAA games POSTPONED The upcoming 'A Quiet Place 2' and the latest 'Fast & Furious' movie were postponed MLB delays opening day by at least two weeks NHL suspends season amid coronavirus pandemic Major League Soccer is shutting down for 30 days Congresswoman Tlaib questioned Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), about the prediction during a hearing of the House of Representatives with members of the president's coronavirus task force on Thursday. It could see 46 percent of the U.S. population infected with the virus at the upper end of the projection, as the country braces itself for further cases. Even at the lower projected level of infection, the estimated rates combined with the current mortality rate for the coronavirus predicts 700,000 deaths for the country's 327 million population. By comparison, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned this week that up to 70 percent of her country's population could get the virus. Asked by Tlaib whether he believed the projection was accurate, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), told the hearing: 'We really need to be careful with those kinds of predictions because that's based on a model.' He added that 'all models are as good as the assumptions that you put into the model' and that with containment and mitigation the upper end of the projection could be avoided. About 80 percent of coronavirus cases are mild, and the overall mortality rate is around one percent, according to the latest estimate provided by Fauci to Congress on Wednesday. At the low end of the projection this would mean about 700,000 deaths. At the high end it would mean 1.5 million deaths. Heart disease was the leading cause of death for Americans in 2018, with just over 650,000 deaths in 2018. The flu and pneumonia caused around 60,000 deaths. As of Thursday evening, there are more than 1,700 cases and 41 deaths in the United States but testing has remained limited. According to one health expert there could currently be as many as 100,000 undiagnosed cases in the state of Ohio alone. It had five confirmed cases as of Thursday night. Risk from coronavirus starts to increase for people who are over 60 and is heightened more for those over 80, as well as for people with conditions like diabetes, heart disease or lung disease, or whose immune systems are compromised. According to Axios, Dr. Monahan said that 80 percent of people who contract the coronavirus will recover. Fauci noted that a 2014 model by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projected the African Ebola outbreak could affect more than a million people. But this was eventually not the case and the final number was under 30,000. Fauci also responded to a query about people having difficulty getting access to tests, for which US authorities have come under severe criticism. 'The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing,' said Fauci.'Let's admit it. 'The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we're not.' Last Friday leaked documents revealed US hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirusinfections and nearly half a million deaths from the outbreak. The spread of the deadly disease could be far worse than officials claim, with 480,000 Americans expected to die from the virus and4.8 million hospitalized, according to apresentation hosted byThe American Hospital Association (AHA) in February. This puts the crisis on a level more than 10 times greater than that seen in a severe flu season. Dr. James Lawler, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, presented the harrowing 'best guess' estimates of the extent of the outbreak to hospitals and health professionals as part of the AHA webinar called 'What healthcare leaders need to know: Preparing for the COVID-19' on February 26. The slides, obtained by Business Insider, suggest that hospitals need to ramp up preparations now to reduce the death toll around the US. At the time of the presentation, there were more than 80,000 confirmed cases around the globe. At the time, the US had around 60 cases and no deaths. Fast forward just two weeks, and the US has more than 1,700 cases and 41 confirmed deaths. On Thursday, President Trump said a domestic travel ban is a possibility if coronavirus gets 'too hot' in certain areas of the US. On Thursday during a meeting with a press in the Oval Office, Trump said when asked about possibly restricting movement within the America: 'We haven't discussed that yet.' 'Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,' POTUS admitted during the bilateral meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. Worldwide, more than 128,000 people have now been infected including actor Tom Hanks, his wife Rita Wilson andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s wife Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau. Trudeau's office released a statement Thursday night confirming that the 44-year-old has tested positive for the virus a day after she reported feeling mild flu-like symptoms, including a low fever, on Wednesday night. 'She is feeling well, is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. Justin Trudeau, 48, is 'in good health' has no symptoms but will be in isolation for 14 days, according to the statement. The comments from Tlaib came as a state of emergency was declared in New York City and a lock down was place don a suburb of Philadelphia as officials struggle to contain the virus. New York's roads and streets became increasingly more deserted on Thursday as Broadway was shut down until April 12 and all large gatherings were suspended.The Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center, the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall all canceled events through March 31. Areas normally flooded with tourists stood silent as panic shopping gripped the city. The generally bustling Times Square was empty as increasing numbers of employees worked from home and others sheltered from the outbreak. Panicked New Yorkers rushed to stock up on essentials forming long lines and clearing shelves of produce asMayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city due the coronavirus outbreak. He made the decision on Thursday afternoon saying the last 24 hours had been 'very, very sobering' and that the world had been turned 'upside down' in just a day. The announcement immediately sparked furious panic shopping from New Yorkers as grocery stores across the city saw chaos and frantic stockpiling with residents fearing the worst. De Blasio attempted to calm the panic, asking for a stop in the spread of misinformation and stating that Manhattan would not be quarantined. 'NO, there is NO TRUTH to rumors about Manhattan being quarantined,' he said in a tweet. 'Whoever is spreading this misinformation, PLEASE STOP NOW!' Concerned shoppers revealed that some stores were limiting the number of people allowed inside because of the need for distancing between customers and so lines waiting outside were becoming more extreme. Across the country roads appeared deserted as more and more public attractions shut down. A video taken from Seattle showed only a couple of cars traveling at the busiest time of the day. 'It's rush hour in Seattle and there's only a couple of cars in the SR-99 Tunnel. This is so unusual. So many people are using precautions, like working from home, to help protect themselves from,' said reporter Franque Thompson. Washington D.C. became a ghost down as public tours were called off until the end of the month and even Disney revealed it was to close its gates. Disneyland and California Adventure theme parks in Southern California will close from Saturday through the end of the month, the company said on Thursday. No cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, have been reported at the parks in Anaheim, California, a company representative said in a statement. Earlier on Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom had recommended against gatherings of more than 250 people to help contain the spread of coronavirus, which has killed more than three dozen people in the United States. Disney decided to close both of its Southern California parks after reviewing Newsom's guidelines 'and in the best interest of our guests and employees,' its statement said. The Disney-run hotels in Anaheim will remain open through Monday to give guests time to make travel arrangements, the company said. Disney will pay its employees during the shutdown and refund payments for hotel bookings, it added. Also on Thursday, Congress announced it is shutting the Capitol to the public until April in reaction to the spread of the coronavirus, a rare step that underscores the growing gravity with which the government is reacting to the viral outbreak. In a statement, the House and Senate sergeants at arms said congressional office buildings and the Congressional Visitor Center, through which tourists enter the Capitol, were also being shuttered. In an email to lawmakers' offices, the sergeants at arms said the Capitol will be closed to all tours, including special ones led by House and Senate members and their aides. No tours will be permitted in the Capitol Visitor Center, a massive three-level underground structure, which opened in 2008 and had greeted more than 21 million visitors through 2018. Lawmakers' offices will be required to meet any official visitors at building entrances, and they were asked to escort them out after the meetings. Only lawmakers, staff, journalists and visitors with official business will be permitted to enter the buildings. The closures begin at 5 p.m. EDT Thursday, and the buildings are scheduled to reopen on April 1. The officials said they were acting on the advice of District of Columbia health officials and of Congress' own doctors. Major League Baseball also delayed the start of its season by at least two weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak and suspended the rest of its spring training schedule. Opening day had been scheduled for March 26. The decision announced by Commissioner Rob Manfred on Thursday left open whether each team would still play 162 games. Airports also remained eerily empty as passengers voted against travel amid expectations of the Europe to United States travel ban that will come into force at midnight Friday. Worried American citizens flooded to European airports on Wednesday night as President Trump announced the ban, desperate to make it home in case further restrictions were enforced or the outbreak worsened. Chaos is unfolding in airports across the country where media members have been kicked out, travelers entering the US complain that they aren't screened upon landing, and disgruntled Americans pay up to $20,000 to get a last minute ticket home. The ban will apply to travelers who have visited 26 countries in the EU's Schengen border-free area in the last 14 days, but not travelers from the UK or Ireland, or to US citizens, American permanent residents and their immediate family members. Although Trump's new measures won't take effect until Friday at midnight, travelers are still in a frenzy over the confusing new rules. International airports across the country have become eerie ghost towns with few travelers in light of the coronavirus panic. Some American travelers have complained about a lack of safety procedures and caution at airports across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s wife Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau has tested positive for coronavirus. Trudeau's office released a statement Thursday night confirming that the 44-year-old has tested positive for the virus a day after she reported feeling mild flu-like symptoms, including a low fever, on Wednesday night. 'She is feeling well, is taking all the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild,' the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. Justin Trudeau, 48, is 'in good health' has no symptoms but will be in isolation for 14 days, according to the statement. He is not being tested at this time because he is asymptomatic, and will continue his duties as normal.He is slated to address Canadians on Friday. Sophie Trudeau began to exhibit symptoms on Wednesday evening after returning to Canada from a trip to the UK where she attended the WE Day UK Charity event and concert in London last Tuesday March 3. Idris Elba, Jamie Oliver, race car driver Lewis Hamilton and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard were also present at the event. Sophie released a reassuring statement Thursday saying she's doing well despite experiencing 'uncomfortable symptoms'. 'First, Iâ€™d like to say a big thank you to all of you who have reached out to me asking how Iâ€™m doing. Although Iâ€™m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon. Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns. 'We will get through this situation together. Please share the facts and take your health seriously. 'I send you all my courage and warm thoughts (but only ""get better"" hugs from afar!)' she wrote. Health officials will reach out to those who've been in contact with her as necessary, the office said. Panicked New Yorkers rushed to stock up on essentials forming long lines and clearing shelves of produce asMayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city due the coronavirus outbreak. He made the decision on Thursday afternoon saying the last 24 hours had been 'very, very sobering' and that the world had been turned 'upside down' in just a day. The announcement immediately sparked furious panic shopping from New Yorkers as grocery stores across the city saw chaos and frantic stockpiling with residents fearing the worst. De Blasio attempted to calm the panic, asking for a stop in the spread of misinformation and stating that Manhattan would not be quarantined. 'NO, there is NO TRUTH to rumors about Manhattan being quarantined,' he said in a tweet. 'Whoever is spreading this misinformation, PLEASE STOP NOW!' He later added that there is 'no need' to stock up fridges and cabinets. 'Our supply chain is active and deliveries are rolling in as normal. Shelves will restock,' de Blasio wrote. Concerned shoppers revealed that some stores were limiting the number of people allowed inside because of the need for distancing between customers and so lines waiting outside were becoming more extreme. 'Apparently Trader Joe's is restricting occupancy due to coronavirus, so the line just to get to the door runs all the way down the block and onto the side street,' one Twitter user wrote. Highways in the city were also clear of traffic during rush hour Thursday evening as many residents worked from home and avoided travel. Stores empty of produce were pictured Thursday evening as limited numbers of customers were seen rushing for coveted items. Shoppers were slowly being let into stores to grabbed what remained buy space was given to avoid a large influx of people at any one time. Aisles of frozen goods remained empty and rows used for vegetables remained empty as early as 6.30pm Thursday just a few hours after the state of emergency was declared. The state of emergency allows de Blasio to now activate a range of extreme measures including a curfew, closing down public transport, prohibiting people from being on the streets, rationing and limiting alcohol use. He has not implemented any of those measures, but the declaration of a state of emergency allows him to at any time. There are now 95 confirmed cases in New York City, 45 more than yesterday.Twenty-two of the 95 people currently fighting the virus have been hospitalized. The New York City breakdown is as follows; 25 in Manhattan, 24 Brooklyn, 17 in Queens, 10 in the Bronx and five in Staten Island. Donald Trump has said a domestic travel ban is a possibility if coronavirus gets 'too hot' in certain areas of the US. The president enforced a European travel ban this week to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 from foreign countries but his move has been criticized by those who believe he hasn't considered enough how to prevent community spread. On Thursday during a meeting with a press in the Oval Office, Trump said when asked about possibly restricting movement within the America: 'We haven't discussed that yet.' 'Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,' POTUS admitted during a bilateral meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. Earlier in the day Trump had contradicted Vice President Mike Pence by saying that Americans in Europe will be tested for COVID-19 before they are allowed to board flights and that they will not be allowed to come home if they test positive. Hours earlier Pence had said all Americans can come home 'regardless' of their condition. The shocking announcement came after Trump's decision to halt all travel from Europe to the US for 30 days starting from Friday at midnight apart from the UK because, he said, 'it doesn't have much infection'. There are 596 cases of the virus in the UK. New Yorkâ€™s Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, and every theater on Broadway are shutting their doors effective immediately in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The opera, philharmonic, and Carnegie Hall said they will shut down at least through the end of the month. Broadway is particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus because its audience skews older, thousands of people are packed into small seats for every show and the industry is dependent on tourism. The iconic cultural venues are just the latest additions to a long list of sports and entertainment entities that have either canceled or postponed their events due to the outbreak of the pathogen. The entertainment industry, a business predicated on drawing crowds in theaters, cinemas and concert venues, braced Thursday for a potential shutdown from the coronavirus as upcoming movies were canceled, festivals scuttled and live audiences eliminated from television shows. To accommodate calls for social distancing, Hollywood moved to pause the normal hum of TV productions and the bustle of red-carpet movie premieres. The upcoming releases of A Quiet Place 2 and the latest Fast & Furious movie, F9, joined the many postponements. The dawning awareness of the virus' reach had already forced the cancellation or postponement of all major imminent events on the calendar, including the sprawling South by Southwest conference and festival in Austin, Texas; Hollywood's annual movie expo CinemaCon, in Las Vegas; this month's Kids Choice Awards in Los Angeles; the sunny California music festival Coachella, which was put off until October; and big television events like the NBA season, which was put on hiatus Wednesday after a player tested positive for the virus. On Thursday, California and some states urged bans of not just the largest events but also gatherings of more than 250 to help stymie the virus' spread. That brought a new focus on Broadway, multiplexes and smaller concert venues. California Governor Gavin Newsom recommended the cancellation or postponement of gatherings of 250 or more people through at least the end of the month. Hollywood still planned to usher in several new movie releases to theaters beginning Thursday evening. North American's largest chains, AMC and Regal, did not immediately respond to emails Thursday. Cinemas have been closed in China, India, Italy, Poland, Greece and other countries. The NCAA has cancelled the men's and women's basketball tournaments over coronavirus fears after a string of major college competitions were also called off. Within minutes of each other, the Atlantic Coast, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern conferences announced that the remainder of their tournaments would not be played. All were preparing to play games in large arenas across the country, but with few people in the buildings. All over the country, from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama, one of the busiest college basketball days of the year - with teams fighting for championship trophies and automatic bids to the NCAA men's and women's tournaments - was being shut down. Not long after that, Duke and Kansas, two of the country's premier basketball schools, suspended all athletic competition involving their teams as the college sports seemingly inched toward calling off Mach Madness. Just a few hours later on Thursday, NCAA decided to cancel March Madness. In a statement they said:'Today, NCAA President Mark Emmert and the Board of Governors canceled the Division I men's and women's 2020 basketball tournaments, as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA championships. 'This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities.' NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said Thursday the league will 'pause' its season, effective immediately, because of the coronavirus pandemic. The move came one day after the NBA suspended its season after a player tested positive for COVID-19. Bettman said there are hopes of resuming the season, holding the playoffs and still handing out the Stanley Cup. The NHL is halting play with 189 games left in the season and uncertainty about how many more - if any - could be played before the playoffs, which typically begin in early April. A handful of European hockey leagues have already called off the remainder of their seasons. Major League Soccer is shutting down because of the coronavirus, according to Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas. Mas says the target period for the hiatus is 30 days. He told players and coaches, then held a news conference and says, 'We've made a decision as a league this morning, as owners, that play will be suspended temporarily.' The expansion team owned by Mas and former England captain David Beckham had been scheduled to play its home opener Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers canceled its annual conference in Los Angeles. 'For the past 15 years, ASCAPâ€™s annual conference has brought together music creators from all over the world to network, collaborate and learn,' the organization said in a statement. 'Out of consideration for the health and safety of our members and all other participants, and due to rising concerns about the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus), the determination has been made to cancel the 2020 ASCAP Experience. 'We are exploring other ways of gathering our music creator community, whether in person or virtually, at a later date and hope to share more on that soon. 'In the meantime, all registered attendees will be eligible for a full registration refund.' Major League Baseball is likely to cancel the rest of its spring training game schedule due to the coronavirus. MLB probably will also announce that the start of the season will be delayed, according to people familiar with the discussions. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no decision had been announced. They said Commissioner Rob Manfred planned a conference call with his executive council Thursday to discuss the situation and then a call with team owners. MLB had continued to play into Thursday, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said he strongly recommended to local authorities and organizers that they limit all mass gatherings. The major league season had been scheduled to start March 26, its earliest opening other than for international games. The ceremony was due to take place at the Forum in Inglewood, California, while Chance the Rapper was on hosting duties. But Nickelodeon has postponed the event in 'consideration of the safety and well-being of every person involved with the show, which is our top priority.' A new date will be announced 'in the future,' the network said. The LGBTQ awards show was set to take place in New York next week but was cancelled on Wednesday. The revered actress, 84, had been set to receive a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute on April 25. But it has been postponed, with a new date to be announced. The Seattle-based rock band postponed the North American leg of their tour due to the virus outbreak. In a statement, the group said it was with 'deep frustration and regret' that they were pushing back the Gigaton 2020 tour. The first date was set for March 18 in Toronto, with 13 other cities scheduled across Canada and the US. The European leg, beginning in Germany in June, is listed on Pearl Jam's website as still going ahead. Smithsonian museums and all national zoos close  The Smithsonian Institute released a statement saying all Smithsonian museums in Washington D.C and New York City will close, starting Saturday, March 14. This includes the National Zoo. There is no end date to the closures, and updates on reopenings will be given on a week-to-week basis. Billie Eilish cancels all March dates 'until further notice' Billie Eilish has postponed her upcoming Where Do We Go? tour dates in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Bad Guy artist took to Twitter Thursday to update her fans on her upcoming appearances. She wrote: 'It is with great sadness to announce the following Billie Eilish â€˜WHERE DO WE GOâ€™ North American tour dates have been postponed until further notice. Celine Dion cancels Courage Tour concert Celine Dion's Courage Tour became one more statistic in the tally of events postponed or cancelled due to the coronavirus. Her official Twitter account tweeted a brief message, saying: 'CÃ©line Dion #CourageWorldTour dates postponed in North America. Show dates from March 24 through April 27, 2020 to be rescheduled. - Team CÃ©line.' The news came just one day after the Canadian superstar, 51, postponed two concerts because she is suffering from a cold. She reassured her fans that she did not have COVID-19."
29,"Medicines taken by thousands of people with high blood pressure and diabetes could raise the risk of deadly coronavirus symptoms, scientists claim",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108735/Medicines-high-blood-pressure-diabetes-worsen-coronavirus-symptoms.html,"People with high blood pressure and diabetes could be at higher risk of severe or fatal coronavirus symptoms because of how their medicines work, scientists say. Drugs called ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may change the shape of someone's cells in a way that makes it easier for the coronavirus to infect them and cause a more severe illness. The common medications were prescribed almost 65million times in England last year and cost the NHSmore than Â£100m. They are given to treat diabetes or high blood pressure and around 10 per cent of people in the UK â€“ some 6.6million â€“ are estimated to take them regularly. A paper published in prestigious British medical journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine studied how the coronavirus latches on to people's cells to infect them. But a doctor has warned that patients who take the medicines must not stop doing so â€“ they should speak to their doctor if they have concerns. Scientists say the research does not prove a link between the medications and severe COVID-19, but that a potential connection should be studied more closely. Other risk factors for severe or deadly coronavirus infection include age â€“ over-80s are most likely to die â€“ and heart disease. People with weak immune systems, such as cancer patients, or those with long-term lung conditions are also at higher risk but are by no means guaranteed to get seriously ill. It comes as the number of confirmed coronavirus patients in the UK has hit 590 and 10 people have died â€“ the Government says 5,000-10,000 people may be infected. The article was published by scientists at University Hospital Basel, in Switzerland, and the University of Thessaloniki in Greece. It explains that the coronavirus sticks to cells and attacks them by latching onto something called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Some people with high blood pressure or type 1 or type 2 diabetes have to take drugs which increase the amount of ACE2 that they have on their cells, in order to control their illness. There are more than 16million people with these diseases in the UK â€“ but not all patients are given them so the exact number of people taking the drugs is unclear. The drugs the researchers were interested in are called ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The most prescribed versions of these in England are Ramipril, Losartan, Lisinopril and Candesartan, according to NHS data. The drugs mentioned in the paper are called ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Both are used to treat people with high blood pressure and/or diabetes and work by relaxing the arteries, increasing how much blood can flow through them and reducing strain on the heart. In the UK they cost the NHS more than Â£100million per year, were prescribed around 65million times in 2018, and are taken by millions of people in the UK and US. One cardiologist's estimate suggested around 10 per cent of the population takes the medications â€“ some 6.6million people. The most prescribed versions of these in England are Ramipril, Losartan, Lisinopril and Candesartan, according to NHS data. People who are prescribed these medications should not stop taking them. The scientists' paper is not a study which can prove any link to severe COVID-19 but is a call for more research into a possible connection. Anyone who is concerned about continuing to take their medicine should speak to their doctor. Other blood pressure lowering drugs do exist and can be used as alternatives in some situations. Medications called calcium channel blockers (CCPs) and diuretics, such as Bendroflumethiazide and Furosemide, can also be used to lower high blood pressure. The type of medicines patients are given depends on their individual condition and not all are interchangeable. Researchers led by Dr Michael Roth, from the University of Basel, wrote: 'These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. 'Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. 'We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension [high blood pressure] treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19. 'If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment.' Professor Tim Chico, from the University of Sheffield, said the article was not evidence of a link between the drugs and a higher risk of dying from the coronavirus. He said: 'This letter does not report the results of a study; it simply raises a possible question about whether a type of blood pressure and heart disease medication called ACE inhibitors might increase the chances of severe COVID19 infections. 'It does not give any evidence that confirms this, simply it suggests such a relationship should be looked for. 'It is very important that this letter is not interpreted or reported as saying that ACE inhibitors are proven to worsen COVID19 disease. 'I strongly advise anyone on heart medications not to stop or change these without discussion with their doctor. 'If a patient stops their medication and worsens to the point of requiring admission to hospital at the same time as we are dealing with an increase in COVID-19 cases, that would pose the patient a considerable risk and put further strain on the healthcare services.' Dr Dipender Gill, who works at Imperial College NHS Trust in London added: 'Evidence is currently lacking and it is too early to make robust conclusions on any link between use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers with risk or severity of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. 'Furthermore, the acute implications of stopping such medications in relation to effects on risk or severity of COVID-19 infection are not known. 'Patients should be advised to follow public health guidance rather than alter their medications without proper and informed consultation with their medical doctor.' Dr Roth and his colleagues did their research by looking at other studies of coronavirus patients with severe forms of the illness. They found that the most common illnesses among severely-ill coronavirus patients were high blood pressure (23.7 per cent), diabetes (16.2 per cent) and heart disease (5.8 per cent). And by studying how the coronavirus and SARS, which is almost identical, attach to cells inside people's bodies they came up with a theory of how the blood pressure drugs might make this easier for the viruses. They also added that people with diabetes and high blood pressure might be more at risk because of changes in their genes which make them produce more ACE2 naturally. They wrote: 'We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension [high blood pressure], or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored.'"
30,Barack Obama backs tough measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus and says 'we have to look after each other' amid criticism of Trump,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107873/Barack-Obama-backs-tough-measures-tackle-coronavirus-says-look-other.html,"Barack Obama has backed tough measures to tackle coronavirus, after various areas across the country issued states of emergencies in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at large public gatherings. On Wednesday several sporting agencies suspended game play seasons, including the NBA, andPresident Donald Trump has been the target of criticism for his European travel ban while politicians urge him to address the domestic spread closely. As Broadway shows were canceled in New York and television shows ditched filming with a studio audience, on Thursday night the 44th President appeared to tell America it was necessary. 'If you're wondering whether it's an overreaction to cancel large gatherings and public events (and I love basketball), here's a useful primer as to why these measures can slow the spread of the virus and save lives,' Obama tweeted to 113.7 million followers. 'We have to look out for each other.' The graphic by the CDC was an example of of what epidemiologists call 'flattening the curve' a strategy of preventing a huge spike in infectious cases. University of Washington biologist,Carl Bergstrom, helped it go viral when he shared a version of it March 6 and tweeted: 'Even if you don't reduce total cases, slowing down the rate of an epidemic can be critical.' On Thursday night, Trump shifted attention to the Swine Flu epidemic 11 years ago. 'Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!' Trump then attacked Obama as he quoted a Fox Business host: 'The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Bidenâ€™s remarks, and any alarm that he might have caused, an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency, and that killed 12,000 Americans.' As of Thursday night 1,716 cases had been confirmed in the US and there were 41 reported deaths attributed to COVID-19. However Trump has also been criticized for the delay in testing Americans due to contaminated kits distributed and lack of access to testing facilities. Bernie Sanders called out the Trump administration for its 'incompetence and recklessness' as he demanded Thursday that the president declare the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency. The democratic socialist also argued that Americans needed to receive healthcare treatment related to the disease for free. 'Unfortunately in this time of international crisis, it is clear to me, at least, that we have an administration that is largely incompetent, and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in our country,' the 2020 hopeful said in a speech delivered Thursday afternoon from his adopted hometown of Burlington, Vermont. Earlier Thursday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow had told Republicans that an emergency declaration was on the table, but later Thursday Trump was noncommittal. Sanders' remarks came two hours after Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner, also gave a speech, imploring, like the Vermont senator, that the administration's response be grounded in science. President Trump's campaign hit back shortly after Sanders finished making comments. 'Bernie Sanders is the wrong prescription for fighting an outbreak like the coronavirus,' said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director. 'Like Joe Biden, Sanders advocates a government takeover of healthcare, which would close hundreds of rural hospitals.' Biden has also announced his own coronavirus task force. And he's changed campaign events in Illinois and Florida to virtual town halls. Sanders has been in Vermont since Tuesday and has only campaigned so far as addressing reporters from a Burlington hotel. Meanwhile, it wasn't until Wednesday night - and after he addressed a national audience - that Trump called off planned travel to Nevada and Colorado. In the Oval Office Thursday he said that he's likely to cancel a planned Florida rally. 'We have a big one in Tampa, all sold out. We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think weâ€™ll probably not do it because people would say itâ€™s better to not do,' Trump said."

Employees in American branches have also been instructed not to offer Apple Watch or AirPods try-ons due to concerns over the viral pandemic. Customers attending tech support appointments in US Apple Stores will also be more physically spaced out in order to lower the risk of spreading infection. Stores in the UK are still hosting'Today at Apple' demo sessions at present. Scroll down for video Coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people in China, but the daily number of new cases fell to just 26 on March 11 â€” compared with the peak of 15,200 daily back in mid-February, the World Health Organization have reported. The abating outbreak has allowed Apple to today reopen its 42 stores across mainland China â€” up from the 38 that had returned to business as of last week. The tech firm had temporarily closed down its stores in the country back in February amidst concerns about the safety of its customers â€” a move which has caused a slump in the sales of its products in China. Together with the impact of coronavirus on the firm's China-based iPhone production line, the firm now projects that a lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. In the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, meanwhile, the arrival of coronavirus outbreak has now prompted Apple to suspend all 'Today at Apple' display sessions. The move is the latest in a series of new health precautions implemented by the tech firm in its retail outlets. In-store sessions were cancelled around Seattle and the San Francisco Bay area â€” where coronavirus cases have been reported in higher numbers â€” on March 9, along with events planned to honour International Women's day at various flagship outlets. New York City and its surrounding suburbs, meanwhile saw their stores' sessions cancelled on 12 March. 'Today at Apple' sessions remain suspended in mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and in Italy â€” in the latter of which all Apple Stores have been temporarily closed. For the moment, Apple stores in the US are to remain open. Nevertheless, employees have been instructed to minimise the number of customers trying on AirPods wireless earbuds and Apple Watches in order to minimise the risk of spreading infection. Staff are also recommended to increase the physical distance between individuals when organising so-called 'Genius Bar' tech support appointments. Apple retail workers exhibiting coronavirus-like symptoms will be granted unlimited sick leave."
32,Doctor says we are 'handcuffed' without enough coronavirus tests as others warn we must prepare hospitals fora a 'surge' in severe cases and say the window of opportunity to stop the pandemic 'narrows by the day',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109491/Doctor-says-handcuffed-without-coronavirus-tests.html,"A doctor warned on Friday that without testing, the country is 'handcuffed' and unable to fight the escalating coronavirus crisis properly. Until everyone who needs it is able to be tested, isolated and then treated,Dr. Todd Ellerin - an infectious diseases expert - said we will not be able to tackle the pandemic. Dr. Ellerin, who is working out of Boston, told Good Morning America: 'The demand for testing far exceeds our capability right now. 'We are seeing an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory illness who need this test. 'It's critical that we identify, test more, so we can isolate these patients, inform their close contacts for quarantine and figure out how broad-reaching this epidemic is. 'Without testing, we're really handcuffed,' he said. Scroll down for video It comes amid growing criticism of the government's forward planning to produce enough tests for the US to be able to handle the pandemic. On Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom revealed that some doctors and labs in his state had even been sent tests by the CDC that were missing the crucial parts needed to diagnose. He slammed the government for it, saying it was akin to buying a printer without the ink. Until everyone can be tested, the advice from the government has been to implement social distancing by staying away from large crowds and avoiding coming into close contact with the elderly or sick who are thought to be the most susceptible to the infection. But on Friday, Dr. Jen Ashton said the true impact of the virus and the average age of patients is still not known because the CDC has not yet revealed any clinical data for its confirmed cases. 'We're still collecting clinical data, of the over 1,000 cases in the US, the CDC has yet to release any clinical data so we don't know the average age of patients, their pre-existing conditions, we don't know how many are severe or how many can be managed at home. 'As per the CDC, an older individual is over 60. But I want to be really clear about this, John's Hopkins released a paper on Monday where the average age was 44. 'We are going to see sporadic cases of seriously affected younger people who are not in the elderly age group. Other doctors are warning that trying to implement complete shut-downs of cities, as was down in China and as is being done in Italy now, will not halt the spread. 'We are likely to find that spread is far more distributed in communities across U.S. and while total case count may still be in high thousands or probably low ten thousands, the widespread seeding make an epidemic inevitable. 'Aggressive social distancing now must be focus. 'We must also prepare hospitals for a surge in cases requiring advanced care that could start to become obvious in few weeks as people currently being infected start to develop complications. 'Time to hospitalization is more than a week so will take time for these cases to present. 'We must focus on slowing spread through tough mitigation steps and reducing the scope and severity of the epidemic by good medical planning. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Gottlieb said that city-wide shutdowns were not needed and that people should just focus on 'aggressive' social distancing instead. 'The United States isnâ€™t in that dire state yet, and with the proper use of well-coordinated mitigation measures across the country, we can prevent that outcome,' he said, referring to the 'draconian' measures in Italy and China. 'In any case, such cordons are blunt instruments that donâ€™t do anything to achieve the necessary social distancing for the people trapped inside them,' he said. He did not explain why he believes they do not work, but said the window of opportunity to stop the pandemic becoming worse 'narrows by the day'. 'There is still time to implement tough mitigation measures that would reduce the scope of a nationwide epidemic. 'But that opportunity narrows with each passing day,' he said. He urged the government to mandate working from home and said the response has been too slow. 'In addition to stopping large indoor gatherings, mitigation includes closing schools and mandating telework. 'But right now, the steps are being undertaken in a piecemeal fashion. Thatâ€™s not good enough. 'Local, state and national officials should move quickly to coordinate with public health officials on implementing these measures coherently,' he wrote."
33,CNN host Chris Cuomo is slammed for telling viewers to 'go straight ethnic' in their approach to hygiene amid coronavirus outbreak,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108377/CNN-host-Chris-Cuomo-tells-viewers-straight-ethnic-cleaning-amid-coronavirus.html,"CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has sparked outrage by telling his viewers to 'go straight ethnic' when it comes to cleaning surfaces to combat coronavirus. The presenter, 49, was discussing the pandemic with CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta on Thursday night. There have been more than 1,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US and 41 deaths so far. Discussing the deepening crisis, Cuomo asks: 'How long can the thing live, like, on my desk?' Dr Gupta replies: 'Well, I'm going to give you the answer, but I don't want people to freak out by this... it can live on surfaces for days, actually. If someone coughs or sneezes in here, it doesn't matter if you disinfected yesterday, you've got to disinfect again.' Cuomo then says with a chuckle: 'Go straight ethnic. Be cleaning everything all the time with the harshest cleaners that you can find.' Some commenters on social media have now demanded Cuomo should be fired. 'While talking about the importance of sanitizing and cleansing, @ChrisCuomo said people need to ""go straight ethnic"". 'This is an insensitive comment @CNN needs to take [responsibility] and #FireChrisCuomo,' liberal activist Nikola said on Twitter. Meanwhile, US hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths from the outbreak, leaked documents have revealed. The spread of the deadly disease could be far worse than officials claim, with 480,000 Americans expected to die from the virus and 4.8 million hospitalized, according to a presentation hosted by The American Hospital Association (AHA) in February. This puts the crisis on a level more than 10 times greater than that seen in a severe flu season. Donald Trump has also decided to halt all travel from Europe to the US for 30 days starting from Friday at midnight apart from the UK because, he said, 'it doesn't have much infection'. There are 596 cases of the virus in the UK."
34,"Coronavirus pandemic has killed more 5,000 people as Europe continues to battle escalating crisis",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109067/Coronavirus-pandemic-killed-5-000-people.html,"The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic today soared past 5,000 as Europe continues to battle its escalating crisis. A total of 3,176 people have died in mainland China, followed by 1,016 in Italy, and 514 in Iran â€“ the three countries with the highest number of deaths. Since COVID-19 was first detected in December, more than 134,300 people have been infected in 121 countries and territories. Cases have also soared past 600 in the UK, after Wales confirmed 13 people had been diagnosed today. Europe has rapidly become the new epicentre of the killer coronavirus, with a total of28,549 cases. Travel across the 51 states has been partially suspended to curb the epidemic which largely stemmed from an outbreak in northern Italy. New cases of the coronavirus - which had never been seen before December 2019 - are being reported daily around the world. Eight countries have reported more than 1,000 cases so far, including the US, where 1,663 have been infected and 41 have died. European countries are banning gatherings, cancelling events and shutting down schools, universities and shops in a bid to slow the spread of COVID-19. Italy:Italy put full-scale lockdowns nationwide in place on March 9, with court action and fines threatened for people breaking imposed curfews. Schools, cafes, hairdressers and restaurants have been closed as 60million residents are told to stay in their homes. Countries across the globe have cancelled flights to Italy and restricted Italians from entering, while Austria and Slovenia imposed border restrictions with the Mediterranean country. Norway:Closed all schools, nurseries and universities, gyms, swimming pools and buffet restaurants, and banned sports events, according to local media. It has also called for people to limit their use of public transport and to work from home where possible. Portugal: Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities while placing limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time. The country's football league was also suspended. Belgium: Closure of all restaurants, cafes and nightclubs from Friday as it also banned recreational and sporting events and cancelled school classes. Nurseries and public transport are to remain open. Denmark: Authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling, schools and universities were closed, and indoor events with more than 100 participants were banned. Officials also encouraged bars and nightclubs to close and said libraries, gyms, and museums would close from Friday, Danish media reported. Spain:Parliament was temporarily suspended and its deputy prime minister in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus. Media reported that Catalan authorities have shut down four towns around the village of Igualada, around 30 miles north of Barcelona. Schools in the capital, Madrid, have begun a two-week shutdown. Germany:Nightclubs and schools are being closed and many football matches will be played behind closed doors - as well as the Euro 2020 warm-up match between Italy and Germany, scheduled for March 31. The Republic of Ireland: Closures of schools, colleges and nurseries, with Irish premier Leo Varadkar calling for bans on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people or outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people. Scotland:Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled.  Kazakhstan, Kenya and Ethiopia today confirmed their first cases. The only places in Europe left to declare a case are Montenegro and Kosovo. Turkey has become the most recent EU state to be hit with coronaivrus, with its second case announced today. The killer bug first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. A small cluster of people had pneumonia with an unknown cause, which spurred scientists on to do further tests. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease caused by the coronavirus, which can cause mild symptoms or leave some hospitalised and battling to survive. The impact on the world has been large enough for the World Health Organization to label the crisis a 'pandemic' - defined as a worldwide spread of a new disease. French President Emmanuel Macron said the pandemic is France's worst health crisis in a century, following comments from the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday that Britain was facing the 'worst public health crisis for a generation'. The World Health Organization said Iran's healthy system is being significantly challenged by the outbreak. Figures show 11,364 have fallen ill with COVID-19, but there is widespread suspicion that the true scale of the crisis is being covered by health officials. Some countries that were initially the worst effected are seeing improvements -South Korea, once the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, today reported its lowest number of new cases for three weeks. China has benefited from strict lock downs never practised before. At its coronaivrus peak in mid-February, the country was recording around 3,500 new cases a day. This dramatically slowed, with only 26 new cases recorded yesterday. However, the infection is sweeping across Europe. The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has jumped by 33 per cent in the last 24 hours. More than 1,016 people have died across the nation, 189 of whom were in a single day. The crisis has led to aggressive control measures, with people confined to their homes in a nationwide ban on shops, restaurants and schools opening. Today France banned gatherings of more than 100 people in a public place, following Italy, Ireland and Scotland. Mass gatherings are being cancelled as a result, including football matches and other sporting events. There have been prompts to postpone the London Marathon, which has at least 40,000 runners and 750,000 spectators, afterSaint Patrick's Day celebrations were called off. Nations including Austria, Portugal, France, Denmark and Norway have closed schools and universities. One of the most dramatic interventions is to begin today - US President Donald Trump has imposed a 30-day ban on travellers from 26 European countries. Meanwhile, flights to Italy have been cancelled across the globe to stop travellers taking coronavirus across borders. Austria and Slovenia imposed border restrictions with the Mediterranean country. The labelling of a pandemic ensures more money is pumped into strategies to end it. The UN have released US$15 million to global funds, while France has pledged US$100million to the WHO. The European Union will establish a â‚¬37billion investment initiative as part of a cushion the bloc's fall in economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said.

35,FDA approves pharmaceutical company's new coronavirus test that is TEN TIMES faster than the US government's kit amid growing anger over the Trump administration's failuresÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8108741/US-regulators-approve-Roches-new-faster-COVID-19-test.html,"Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche announced it has received emergency approval from US regulators for a new and much faster coronavirus test. On Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grantedan 'emergency use authorization' to commercialize the test, which is 10 times faster than the American government's kit. The test can be run in high volumes on fully automated equipment, Roche said, suggesting it could provide more results far faster than other tests available. Widespread testing is essential in the race to rein in the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 134,000 people and killed more than 5,000 worldwide. 'We are increasing the speed definitely by a factor of 10,' Thomas Schinecker, head of Roche's diagnostics unit, told Bloomberg News. The new Roche tests, which will also now be available in markets that accept the European CE-mark certification, can provide results within about three-and-a-half hours, the company said. In a 24-hour period, the largest machines can reportedly process up to 4,128 tests. 'It is important to quickly and reliably detect whether a patient is infected' with the virus,' Schinecker said, insisting that speeding up the process of providing reliable diagnostics was 'crucial to combat this serious disease.' Roche said it would have millions of tests available each month, and that it was committed to pushing the limits of its production capacity and delivering as many tests as possible. DailyMail.com has reached out for comment, which was not available at the time of publication. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the FDA, praised the news on Twitter, saying it would 'significantly improve' the capacity to test patients across all labs. In the US, more than 1,700 people have been infected and 41 people have died, but Gottlieb said the figures are probably lower than the true number. 'We are likely to find that spread is far more distributed in communities across US and while total case count may still be in high thousands or probably low ten thousands, the widespread seeding make an epidemic inevitable,' he tweeted. 'We must focus on slowing spread through tough mitigation steps and reducing the scope and severity of the epidemic by good medical planning. Every day, every hour, is critical to preparedness.' The news also comes on the heels of criticism surrounding the delay of US officials to conduct widespread testing. Less than week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shipped its first batch of kits, several state labs said the diagnostic was returning 'inconclusive results.' This forced the federal health agency to remanufacture components of the kit. Ever since the CDC started to address this issue, delays have continued. As of Thursday, just 13,624 specimens have been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19 at CDC labs and US public health laboratories. according to the CDC's website. At a Monday press conference, Vice President Mike Pence said that one million test kits had been distributed and that four million were expected to go about by the end of this week or the next. However, he did not specify where the kits were sent to, or would be sent to. Both Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Vice President Pence said the government currently does not have enough kits to keep up with demand. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, insists that only is widespread testing occuring but that it's going smoothly. 'Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth. If you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test,' Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. "
36,Donald Trump defends his response to coronavirus after admitting a travel ban WITHIN the US is 'possible' if the outbreak 'gets too hot' or 'if somebody gets a little bit out of control',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107203/Donald-Trump-says-domestic-travel-ban-possible-coronavirus-gets-hot-certain-areas.html,"Donald Trump has defended his response to the coronavirus outbreak hours after admitting that a domestic travel ban is a possibility if COVID-19gets 'too hot' in certain areas of the US. The president tweeted: 'Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!' By Thursday night there were more than 1,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 41 deaths. It came as Bernie Sanderscalled out the Trump administration for its 'incompetence and recklessness' as he demanded Thursday that the president declare the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency. Sanders' remarks came two hours after Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner, also gave a speech, imploring, like the Vermont senator, that the administration's response be grounded in science. Barack Obama later tweeted: 'If you're wondering whether it's an overreaction to cancel large gatherings and public events (and I love basketball), here's a useful primer as to why these measures can slow the spread of the virus and save lives. We have to look out for each other.' Biden has announced his own coronavirus task force and he's changed campaign events in Illinois and Florida to virtual town halls.Sanders has been in Vermont since Tuesday and has only campaigned so far as addressing reporters from a Burlington hotel. In the Oval Office Thursday Trump only said that he was likely cancel a planned Florida rally. 'We have a big one in Tampa, all sold out. We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think weâ€™ll probably not do it because people would say itâ€™s better to not do,' Trump said. Trump enforced a European travel ban this week to help prevent transmission from foreign countries but his move has been criticized by those who believe he hasn't considered enough how to prevent community spread. On Thursday during a meeting with press in the Oval Office, Trump said when asked about possibly restricting movement within the America: 'We haven't discussed that yet.' 'Is it a possibility? Yes. If somebody gets a little bit out of control, if an area gets too hot,' POTUS admitted during thebilateral meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. Earlierin the day Trump had contradicted Vice President Mike Pence by saying that Americans in Europe will be tested for COVID-19 before they are allowed to board flights and that they will not be allowed to come home if they test positive. Hours earlier Pence had said all Americans can come home 'regardless' of their condition. The shocking announcement came after Trump's decision to halt all travel from Europe to the US for 30 days starting from Friday at midnight apart from the UK because, he said, 'it doesn't have much infection'. There are 596 cases of the virus in the UK. Westchester County - 148 New York City - 95 Nassau County - 41 Suffolk County - 20 Rockland County - 7 Ulster County - 4 Saratoga County - 3 Orange County - 2 Albany - 2 Monroe - 2 Broome - 1 Delaware - 1 Dutchess - 1 Herkimer - 1 New York State Total - 328 Trump could soon impose restrictions within country borders. 'You see what they're doing in New Rochelle, which is good frankly,' Trump continued from his base in Washington DC. In New Rochelle, a city of nearly 80,000 people, a one-mile containment area is now in effect. It's where 148 of New York's 328 coronavirus cases have been reported. The National Guard was seen handing out food and supplies to residents on Thursday morning as the containment efforts began. The area will remain on lockdown for the next two weeks, affecting all 'major gathering places' including schools and places of worship. The radius centers around the Temple Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue that was attended by Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz who has been linked to the outbreak in the area. Referring to the city just north of Manhattan, Trump added: 'It's the right thing, but it's not enforced, it's not very strong. But people know they're being watched. New Rochelle, that's a hot spot.' Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the quarantine on Wednesday. 'New Rochelle at this point is probably the largest cluster in the US of these cases and it is a significant issue for us,' Cuomo said. 'The numbers have been going up. The numbers continue to go up. The numbers are going up unabated. And we do need a special public health strategy for New Rochelle.' He made a point to mention that the decision was made by New York Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker and other public health officials. 'It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. And this is literally a matter of life and death,' he said. Cuomo said the state Health Department will grant $200,000 to a food bank in New Rochelle. The state and a private health system, Northwell Health, are also setting up a testing facility in the area. Eleven schools are closed in the containment area, and the funding is intended to help feed any student or family who relies on free school lunches. Some residents of New Rochelle have expressed concern that the containment zone is too narrow to be effective in curbing the spread of the virus.New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson said state and federal health officials decided the parameters of the zone with little input from city officials. The suburb of about 80,000 residents is at the center of an outbreak of more than 120 cases in Westchester County, out of 240 statewide as of Wednesday. There are now 95 confirmed cases in New York City, 45 more than yesterday.Twenty-two of the 95 people currently fighting the virus have been hospitalized. The New York City breakdown is as follows; 25 in Manhattan, 24 Brooklyn, 17 in Queens, 10 in the Bronx and five in Staten Island. New York City's population is more than 100 times that of New Rochelle. The NYC mayor predicts that by next week, there will be 1,000 cases of coronavirus in New York City. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Panicked New Yorkers had rushed to stock up on essentials, forming long lines and clearing shelves of produce as Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city due the coronavirus outbreak. He made the decision on Thursday afternoon saying the last 24 hours had been 'very, very sobering' and that the world had been turned 'upside down' in just a day. The state of emergency allows de Blasio to now activate a range of extreme measures including a curfew, closing down public transport, prohibiting people from being on the streets, rationing and limiting alcohol use. He has not implemented any of those measures, but the declaration of a state of emergency allows him to at any time. He and his experts are monitoring the number of beds currently available in ICU units across the city. If the healthcare system becomes overrun, emergency teams will set up ICU units and makeshift hospitals anywhere they can, he said. Gatherings of more than 500 people have now been banned and de Blasio warned sports arenas like the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden will remain nonoperational for months. Public spaces - like bars and restaurants - must now operate at 50 percent of their legal capacity. Schools will remain open, he said, but activities like school plays, recitals, PTA meetings and assemblies, that can be moved online will be. City workers who cannot work from home will now be staggered in their shifts. He urged New York City businesses to encourage telecommuting - ie working from home - and staggering staff shifts as 'much as possible'. 'We're worried about folks paying the rent, we want to help people facing eviction - if it's a legal matter we will get them free legal help,' he went on. 'We are concerned about people, again, who have less money because their employment has been compromised, running low on food for their families.' De Blasio attempted to calm the panic, asking for a stop in the spread of misinformation and stating that Manhattan would not be quarantined. 'NO, there is NO TRUTH to rumors about Manhattan being quarantined,' he said in a tweet. 'Whoever is spreading this misinformation, PLEASE STOP NOW!' Concerned shoppers revealed that some stores were limiting the number of people allowed inside because of the need for distancing between customers and so lines waiting outside were becoming more extreme. As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, health experts advise plane travelers to sit in a window seat, disinfect their table trays and window blinds, and warn that wearing a mask won't prevent infection. Officials say the best way to avoid catching the virus, which is spread through viral particles within mucus or saliva, is to keep your hands clean, disinfect your space, and avoid touching your face. It is also advised that plane travelers choose a window seat to have less contact with potentially sick people. 'Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,' Vicki Stover Hertzberg, professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, said. Hertzberg helped conduct a study that followed passengers and crew members on 10 three to five-hour flights during the flu season and found that passengers who sit in the window seats had less contact with ill people. Wearing a mask on the plane may not prove helpful as the air in the aircraft is considered sterile because there are so few microorganisms at such a high altitude and the plane draws fresh air from the outside. About 50 percent of the air in cabins is recirculated but it goes through sophisticated air filters similar to those used in surgical environments, before it's its pushed back into the plane. A problem with paper masks is that they don't have a respirator to filter out infectious air articles. That means passengers are more likely to catch the virus through direct contact from someone with the virus or surfaces rather than through the air. But one study found that the other coronaviruses - such as SARS and MERS - remains on metal, glass, and plastic surfaces for up to nine days. Top tips include: - Good hand hygiene: Frequently wash hands for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitzer - Disinfect your space: Bring your own wipes and wipe down window blinds, seat belts, arm rests, touch screens and tray tables - Choose a window seat: Sit near the window and avoid moving around the cabin to limit exposure to potentially sick people - Use touch screen with a tissue: Avoid contact with surfaces that may hold the virus - Avoid touching your face: 2019-nCov is spread through viral particles in mucus or saliva. Avoid touching your face and transferring germs picked up from surfaces On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence announced that any American can be tested for coronavirus as long as a doctor approves it. The move appears to expand upon previous criteria needed for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But how do you determine if you have symptoms ofCOVID-19 and when you should see a doctor? We break down everything you need to know about being tested for the virus that has infected more than 120 Americans and killed at least nine. WHAT ARE THE LATEST GUIDELINES FOR BEING TESTED? There are three groups of people that the CDC recommends get tested. 1. People with symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath who have been in 'close contact' with someone confirmed to have coronavirus 2. Patients with symptoms who have traveled to areas affected by the virus within the last 14 days 3. Those with symptoms who need to be hospitalized and no other cause for their illness is found. They don't need to have a travel history or exposure to another patient HOW DOES THIS DIFFER FROM THE PREVIOUS CRITERIA? When the CDC first began testing, only those with a travel history to China - where the outbreak emerged - or those who had been exposed to a confirmed coronavirus patient were tested. However, the agency says its criteria for testing is always 'subject to change as additional information becomes available.' WHAT TO DO IF YOU NEED A TEST? Health officials strongly advise that anyone who believes they may be infected not show up unannounced at their doctor's office in case they expose others to the highly-contagious disease. Instead, the CDC suggests immediately calling your physician or healthcare provider. 'Your healthcare professional will work with your state's public health department and CDC to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19,' the CDC's website states. If you are suspected of having the virus, you will most likely get tested at a hospital. The test involves getting a swab of the patient's nostril and throat. If the patient has a wet cough, a sample of sputum (a mixture of saliva and mucus) will also be collected. WHY HAS IT BEEN DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET TESTED? There have been multiple reports of people not having accessing to get tested. The first batch of test kits that the CDC sent to state and local health departments were faulty, which led to a delay. Secondly, the CDC had strict criteria for testing, which led to missed diagnoses of people who caught the virus from so-called 'community spread,' meaning it's unknown how they were infected. A third reasonis that some health departments did not leave the decision to test up to doctors as the CDC suggested. For instance, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health initially required doctors to call a hotline to determine if their patients met CDC criteria for testing. Then, before the test could be administered, it had to be authorized at the State Public Health Lab. WILL IT BE EASIER TO GET TESTED NOW? Since the CDC's testing fiasco, several health departments have either received new kits from the federal agency or made their own. Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) policy so allow more labs can apply for approval to test for the virus. The CDC that 75,000 test kits are currently available and more are being manufactured. FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Han told reporters on Monday that close to one million people would be testedby the end of the week. But figures from the Association of Public Health Laboratories show that likely no more than 100,000 people would be tested by week's end.  "

The debate, which was scheduled to be held in Arizona, will also lack a live audience when it is broadcast on Sunday from CNN's studios. Organizers have also replaced the debate anchor Jorge Ramos with Ilia Calderon after Mr Ramos came into 'direct contact' with a COVID-19 sufferer. He is said to be well and to have 'no symptoms'. The campaign teams for the 77-year-old and 78-year-old presidential candidates announced yesterday that shifting the event was 'the best path forward'. 'Out of an abundance of caution and in order to reduce cross-country travel, all parties have decided that the best path forward is to hold Sunday's debate at CNN's studio in Washington, D.C., with no live audience,' a statement released by the democrats' communications director said. 'In addition, the DNC, CNN and Univision recently learned that Univision anchor and moderator Jorge Ramos was in proximity with someone who was in direct contact with a person that tested positive for coronavirus. 'Both Mr Ramos and the person he was in contact with are in good health and symptom free. 'Despite being cleared by medical professionals and out of an abundance of caution, Jorge has decided to step aside from participating in the upcoming March 15 democratic debate. 'Our number one priority has and will continue to be the safety of our staff, campaigns and all those involved in the debate.' Coronavirus looks set to disrupt the 2020 presidential election cycle as both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have canceled rallies and asked their staff to work remotely. Incumbent president Donald Trump, 73, has also canceled campaign events, and started shifting scheduled rallies to virtual events, reports ABC. A 'Catholics for Trump' event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, scheduled for March 19 has also been shelved, according to his campaigns communications director. There have been 1,758 coronavirus cases in the US since the outbreak was declared, with this number expected to rise significantly. As many as 41 people have died from the virus. Deaths have mostly been reported in individuals over 70 years old with underlying health conditions. The World Health Organisation declared coronavirus a pandemic on Wednesday and warned that countries 'are not doing enough' to tackle the virus. President Trump has suspended flights from China and from Europe, excluding the United Kingdom and Ireland."

Concerned shoppers revealed that some stores were limiting the number of people allowed inside because of the need for distancing between customers and so lines waiting outside were becoming more extreme. 'Apparently Trader Joe's is restricting occupancy due to coronavirus, so the line just to get to the door runs all the way down the block and onto the side street,' one Twitter user wrote. Highways in the city were also clear of traffic during rush hour Thursday evening as many residents worked from home and avoided travel. Stores empty of produce were pictured Thursday evening as limited numbers of customers were seen rushing for coveted items. Shoppers were slowly being let into stores to grabbed what remained buy space was given to avoid a large influx of people at any one time.

New York's roads and streets became increasingly more deserted on Thursday as Broadway was shut down and all large gatherings were suspended. Areas normally flooded with tourists stood silent as panic shopping gripped the city. The generally bustling Times Square was empty as increasing numbers of employees worked from home and others sheltered from the outbreak. Declaring a state of emergency allows de Blasio to enact several extreme measures. It is important to note he has NOT enacted any of them yet, but he can now. They include; He predicts that by next week, there will be 1,000 cases of coronavirus in New York City. However, de Blasio insisted the city is not on the brink of a shutdown. He and his experts are monitoring the number of beds currently available in ICU units across the city.

This ban includes Broadway theaters in Manhattan, New York City, which all seat upwards of 500 people and where the ban will start at 5pm Thursday and continue until April 12 - dwarfing the theater district's two-day closure after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the city.  'For Broadway theaters in Manhattan, these rules will go into effect at 5pm TODAY,' Cuomo tweeted. 'We have already spoken to the theaters about these new measures and they agreed.' Cuomo also said the state is taking measures to create a 'reserve workforce of health care professionals in the event of a staffing shortage'. De Blasio had urged Broadway to stay open in an interview with CNN Thursday morning, after it emerged Wednesday that an usher who worked two theaters on the Great White Way had tested positive for coronavirus. The usher had worked performances of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' at the Booth Theatre and 'SIX' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, meaning thousands of theater-goers may have been exposed to the deadly virus. De Blasio said the aim was to reach a 'kind of balance' and avoid a total closure. 'I don't want to see Broadway go dark if we can avoid it. I want to see if we strike some kind of balance,' he said. 'If we cannot strike the balance of course we can go to closure that's the decision we will make right away.' Broadway producers held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss plans to halt all productions with immediate effect, according to reports on Deadline. De Blasio said the city is committed to preserving schools, mass transit and the healthcare system 'at all costs'. They are tracking the number of hospital beds, ICU units and hospital equipment. De Blasio said he wanted to avoid a city shutdown which would be 'slippery slope' to chaos. 'The danger of going into a full shutdown, it's unrealistic - where do our children go? 'If our children have nowhere to go, their parents can't go to work - that includes parents we depend on; first responders, healthcare worker.s it's a very slippery slope. 'If our transit system isn't working, how do people get to care? You have to balance the negative impacts with the positive impacts,' he said. Gov. Cuomosaid the decision to enforce a one-mile containment area was one made by New York Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker and other public health officials. 'It's not a decision that I'm making. I'm accepting the recommendation of Dr. Zucker. In a situation like this, whether you're president, mayor, governor, let the experts decide and let the science decide the situation,' he said. The shutdown, which will begin on Thursday and last for two weeks, will effect all 'major gathering places' including schools and places of worship, Cuomo said. 'It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. And this is literally a matter of life and death,' Cuomo said. He is taking a firm position on the crisis. On Wednesday night, within minutes of Trump's address to the nation, he told CNN: 'It's not just wash your hands. We're beyond wash your hands, my brother. 'There is going to have to be major shifts in society short-term. 'Long-term we'll be okay. But short-term there is going to be major shifts that government is going to have to enact,' he said. 'In his Wednesday night interview with his brother, Cuomo said that he was looking at the possibility of turning New York public venues into makeshift hospitals. 'I did the New Rochelle containment area. Nobody was ready for it. Closing down schools, we thought this was only 10, 15 people, this is all an overreaction. No. 'The numbers go sky high. There will be disruption. The density has to come down. 'We have to scramble now to make sure we don't have a health care crisis where we don't have hospitals to handle the capacity. 'We have no surge hospital capacity here. 'We may very well, we're looking in New York at secondary structures that we can start to prepare for temporary hospital situations,' he said.

There are fears of a similar situation in the US and the wider world. According to Ready.gov, a website established by the Department of Homeland Security, an emergency kit with food supplies should include enough to allow you to survive for several days. Many of the items required, including water and maps, are inexpensive and easy to find but could save a life in an emergency situation. The kit should be stored in airtight plastic bags and should all fit in one or two easy to carrier containers such as plastic bins or a duffel bag. Food purchased should include canned foods, dry mixes and other staples. While the threat of the coronavirus is not so severe that there will be a lack of electricity, the food should alsonot require refrigeration, cooking, water or special preparation for a general emergency situation. Be sure to also include a manual can opener and eating utensils. When stocking foods, it's important to ensure you purchase foods that you are sure you and your family will eat and to avoid foods that will not make you thirsty as water supply may also be limited. The store should include at least three days of perishable food. Top recommendations include ready-to-eat canned meats, fruits, vegetables and a can opener, protein or fruit bars, dry cereal or granola, peanut butter, dried fruit, canned juices, non-perishable pasteurized milk, high energy foods, food for infants, and comfort stress foods. Water supply should includeone gallon of water per person per day for at least three days, for drinking and sanitation.   Dow plunges 10% in Wall Street's worst trading day since 1987 despite Fed pumping $1.5 TRILLION into bond markets amid panic over Trump's European travel ban Wall Street has suffered its worst trading day since 1987 despite a massive liquidity injection by the Federal Reserve, as markets grimly assess the potentialeconomic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial average was down2,352.75 points, or 9.99 percent, to21,200.47 at the closing bell on Thursday. It was the index's largest percentage drop since the Black Monday crash of 1987, and its largest point drop of all time, beating the record set earlier this week. Just five minutes into Thursday's session, trading was temporarily halted for an unprecedented second time in one week, after the S&P 500 plunged 7 percent and triggered Wall Street's 'circuit breaker'. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both ended the session down more than 9 percent, and officially joined the Dow in a bear market, down well more than 20 percent from recent peaks set just last month. The recent decline has been one of Wall Street's swiftest retreats of this magnitude. The fastest the S&P 500 has ever fallen from a record into a bear market was over 55 days in 1987. The Fed announced on Thursday afternoon that it will pump $1.5 trillion into bond markets on Thursday and Friday, a huge expansion in its $4.2 trillion balance sheet. The move is intended to address what the Fed calls 'highly unusual disruptions' that coronavirus has caused in the short-term lending markets, which arethe plumbing of the financial system, moving large volumes of cash between those who have it and those who need it. The Fed hopes the action will ensure that banks can continue to provide loans to businesses and other borrowers across the economy. The announcement triggered a partial rebound on Wall Street, after steep plunges on Thursday morningtriggered a critical circuit breaker that temporarily halted all trades.But experts warned the Fed's move merely stabilized a potential issue in the money markets, and that the economic threat from the pandemic remains serious. The announcement drove a brief stock rally in afternoon trading, but by the end of the session the major indexes had given back more than any gains. The S&P 500, which professional investors watch more closely, and the Nasdaq Composite joined the Dow deep in bear territory early in Thursday's session, as it became clear that measures to contain coronavirus would likely have severe impacts on businesses. Trump contradicts Pence and throws his coronavirus travel ban into more chaos by saying Americans will NOT be allowed back into US if they test positive President Trump raised fresh questions surrounding his response to the coronavirus on Thursday by saying that Americans in Europe will be tested for before they are allowed to board flights and that they will not be allowed to come home if they test positive - a direct contradiction of Mike Pence's claim hours earlier that all Americans can come home 'regardless' of their condition. The shocking announcement came after Trump's decision to halt all travel from Europe to the US for 30 days starting from Friday at midnight apart from the UK because, he said, 'it doesn't have much infection'. There are 596 cases of the virus in the UK. During a press conference with the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office, Trump said: 'We are not putting them on planes if they test positive. It is going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.' He did notexplainwhich tests would be used or where the diagnosed cases would then be treated overseas. It was a direct contradiction to what Pence said on Thursday morning - that 'everyone' can 'come home regardless of their symptoms or what their condition is' and that they would be asked to go under 'voluntary' quarantine after landing back in the US at one of 13 airports designed to handle the outbreak. Mike Pence, 7.20am 'Every American that is returning from Europe will be screened as they return through 13 separate airports and will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. 'It's a part of the president's strategy...and I've had kids that have studied abroad as well. 'Every one of those families should know that their children can come home. 'They will be -- they will be funneled, as we say, through a series of 13 different airports. 'And then weâ€™ll ask them to self-quarantine regardless of their symptoms or what their condition is' Trump, 12.10pm 'We are not putting them on planes if they test positive. 'It is going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.' Foreign nationals or visa holders without permanent residency will not be allowed back in the US from Friday at midnight, aside from people in the UK and Ireland which have been exempt from the ban. White House coronavirus expert Dr. Anthony Fauci suggested on Thursday that it was because 70 percent of the cases seen in the US could be traced back to continental Europe and not the isles of the UK and Ireland, a fact that is yet to be proven.Many of the known cases in the US have had no travel nexus to any of the known coronvirus hot-spots in Europe - a fact that is worrying local and state officials as efforts to contain the spread in the US ramp up. Pence offered no context or information about the 'funnel' airports on Thursday as he revealed that that was where returning US citizens would be sent,but they are thought to be the 11 bases that were set up to cope with returning passengers from China in February plus two more. There has also been no answer to questions over the type of planes the returning passengers will travel on; when the US brought citizens home from Wuhan in February at the onset of the outbreak, they were put on charter flights but there are no doubt countless more US citizens currently in the whole of continental Europe than there were in Wuhan when the virus erupted and airlines are pulling their flights to the US by the second as a result of the looming ban. The 13airports were set up to be able to house hundreds, if not thousands, in quarantine conditions after the outbreak in China. They are in Honolulu, Chicago, Dallas, L.A.X, San Francisco, Atlanta, JFK, Seattle, Washington DC, Newark and Detroit. The two new ones have not been announced. Pence repeated previous claims that the government had asked private labs including Lab Corp and Quest Diagnostics to speed up the production of their tests, after a wave of criticism over how long the CDC was taking to get theirs off the ground. But he failed to address some key specifics including how or if the ban will impact trade and imports from Europe, or how many people will likely become infected in America despite the drastic new measures. World health officials have already undermined Trump's plan. They say it will not stop the virus from spreading and that the administration should be focusing its efforts on the healthcare system, which will likely buckle under the strain of the pandemic if it reaches the proportions seen in China and Italy. To date, 1,364 people in America have been infected with the virus and 39 have died from it. Pence's revelation that Americans coming back from Europe would be funneled through one of 13 airports came during his appearance on Fox and Friends. He had already appeared on Good Morning America, Today and CNN by the time he spoke, but had failed to answer many of the resounding questions which surround yesterday's announcement. 'Every American that is returning from Europe will be screened as they return through 13 separate airports and will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. It's a part of the president's strategy,' he said. Asked specifically about families with kids overseas, he went on: 'I've had kids that have studied abroad as well. 'Every one of those families should know that their children can come home. They will be -- they will be funneled, as we say, through a series of 13 different airports. And then weâ€™ll ask them to self-quarantine regardless of their symptoms or what their condition is.'"
40,Outrage after Wuhan officials deliver food bought by quarantined residents to them with BIN LORRIES,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8105769/Wuhan-officials-deliver-food-bought-quarantined-residents-BIN-LORRIES.html,"Community officers in Wuhan have faced backlash after they were caught delivering fresh grocery purchased by isolated residents to them with dustbin lorries. Pictures taken by residents on Wednesday shows filthy trucks sending bags of meat and vegetables to a residential complex in Qingshan District of Wuhan. The pictures have sparked outrage after being shared on Chinese social media. The district officials confirmed the incident in a statement released on Wednesday evening. Two officials have been removed from their posts after the incident. One comment read: 'I'm too shocked. Don't talk about dignity, [we're] just trying to survive. Why are people being treated like this? 'We are not pigs and we paid for the grocery. 'Breaking the bottom line of morality again and again,' another commenter added. On February 11, the government enforced tighter quarantine measures on all residential complexes, with no one allowed to enter or leave. Local supermarkets have also stopped selling goods to individuals. Communities in Wuhan are in charge of purchasing and delivering daily essentials to their residents. The district officials confirmed the incident in a statement released on Wednesday evening. 'After investigation, the disciplinary inspection committee found the community using dustbin lorries to dispatch 1,000 portions of meat and 530 of them were already delivered. 'The local community has assembled six groups of workers to knock on doors and apologise to the residents,'the statement continued. Community officers also promised to destroy all the food and deliver new batches on the following morning. Two officials have been removed from their posts after the incident. It is unclear if all the bin lorries in the pictures were delivering to the same residential complex. Another picture of workers loading batches of pork onto an ambulance car also started circling online yesterday. A spokesperson from a hospital in Xinzhou district of Wuhan verified the picture with Pear Video. The unidentified officer said the hospital's ambulance cars had been designated by the government to transport goods during the coronavirus outbreak. 'All the vans are disinfected after every use,' the hospital staff member continued, '[We ask people] please understand as we are under very special circumstances.' Last week, the Qingshan district of Wuhan was under fire after Chinese top officials being heckled by local residents during their visit. Quarantined residents were captured on camera yelling 'fake, fake' at a group of Beijing officials as they said authorities had neglected their daily needs. Sun Chunlan, the ChineseVice Premier, was leading the government team while touring the isolated complex in Qingshan District of Wuhan on March 5. The officials were there to examine the anti-coronavirus operations carried out by local authorities, according to Chinese media. The compound residents can be heard in a video shouting 'people are paying for overpriced food' and 'it's all fake' from their flat windows. Sun Chunlan called for 'an in-depth investigation' to address the issue last week, before bin lorries loaded with bags of grocery were sent to deliver to the residents in same district. The news comes as China sees only 8 new cases today, the lowest since the outbreak first started in January. Elsewhere,Coronaviruspanic has tightened its grip worldwide yesterday as scores of countries dramatically upped their response to the deadly pandemic. France has shut down schools and universities for at least two weeks, with children at home across the continent today as Portugal, Ireland, Malta, Belgium and Luxembourg became the latest countries to shut their classrooms. The Czech Republic has taken even more drastic measures with a ban on all foreign travellers and Czechs leaving the country from March 16. Portugal is declaring a state of alert, limiting visits to retirement homes and shutting down nightclubs with large public events already cancelled. Four towns have been shut down in Catalonia in north-easternSpainwhere police were today stopping cars on a road near Barcelona. In Italy, which is already in lockdown, Catholic churches in Rome have now been shut as the Vatican falls in line with the rest of the country. Football fixtures across Europe have been taking place behind closed doors amid calls for the Euro 2020 tournament to be postponed. Meanwhile, some European passengers were boarding the last flights to America this morning before Donald Trump's unexpected travel ban comes into force tonight. The drastic measures leave Britain increasingly out of step with the rest of Europe after Boris Johnson yesterday declined to impose a ban on schools or public events. Europe now has a total of 28,550 cases, more than half of them in Italy, and 1,198 deaths."
41,'Why are men so GROSS?' Women are horrified to learn that many men NEVER wash their hands after using the bathroom - and they're STILL not doing it despite coronavirus panicÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8105923/Coronavirus-outbreak-leaves-women-shocked-learn-men-never-wash-hands.html,"As coronavirus cases spread and the disease's death count crawls upward, women are being left with one particularly disturbing discovery: A lot of men don't wash their hands after using the bathroom. One of the most repeated pieces of advice from doctors and other health experts in protecting against the disease is to wash one's hands frequently. But with many men admitting that, due to the virus, they're making a new habit of washing their hands when leaving a restroom, women are expressing disgust and horror that they weren't already doing so. The fact that most men don't wash their hands after doing their business isn't actually new information â€” and there are statistics to back it up. A 2019 study published in theAmerican Journal of Public Health and cited by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that only 31 per cent of men wash their hands in the bathroom. That leaves a staggering 69 per cent who don't. Women, meanwhile, wash their hands at a rate of 65 per cent â€” or more than twice as many female hand-washers as men. So it's understandable that women assumed men were washing their hands as well, and have been shocked to learn that this isn't the case. 'WERE MEN NOT WASHING THEIR F***ING HANDS?!'WHAT THE F***, GUYS?!' asked one Twitter user, who screengrabs several tweets from men saying they've noticed other men still not washing. 'OH MY LORD WHY ARE MEN GROSS,' responded another. 'COVID-19 has revealed how many men have not been washing hands for years. Never shaking hands again,' wrote another. One even highlighted a clip of Fox News contributorPete Hegseth from 2019, in which he says, 'I don't think I've washed my hands for ten years. Really. I don't really wash my hands ever. I inoculate myself. Germs are not a real thing. I can't see them, therefor they're not real. Thousands of women have expressed shock and horror on Twitter, with some calling men 'gross' and others wondering why men are so hygiene-averse. 'Did society tell men that washing hands is gay?? Why the aversion?' asked one. Another echoed the sentiment: 'Fellas, is it gay to practice basic hygiene?' Even men are complaining about it, with those who do wash their hands griping on Twitter and sharing stories. 'All of this talk of washing hands to contain the coronavirus...just watched a guy walk out of the menâ€™s room in the airport without even waving his hands at the sink,' wrote one. 'So, be sure to not touch the door handles either as you exit rest rooms. Use a paper towel.' 'We had a meeting here at work for coronavirus concerns,' wrote another. 'And we have to clean our work stations 4 times a day. They emphasis on washing hands but I still see straight guys not washing their hands in the restroom. If it spreads it's because of dirty ass straight men.' And another wrote: 'I think this is a good time to let you know that I became obsessed with proper hygiene as a young kid after reading a book with creepy pictures of germs, and TO THIS DAY, other men see me WASHING MY HANDS LIKE A HUMAN and call me a ""germaphobe.""' 'Men often don't [wash their hands], & they often don't flush toilets & urinals,' said yet another. While men aren't washing their hands, Americans as a whole aren't washing their sheets as often as is recommended. Most experts advise washing bed sheets weekly â€” but a new survey by YouGov found that only39% actually wash them once a week or more. Just over a quarter (28%) do so every two weeks, while 17% wash their sheets once a month or less. 'Worked in bars for five years & noticed this. Also, many guys use their cell phones at urinals. I think it's on the test of us to sever relationships w/ these ppl.' Another man recalled: 'A bartender told me once that he appreciated that I told him when the men's room was out of soap because it showed that I wash my hands.' There are even a handful of men still defending not washing their hands. 'Itâ€™s worse to touch door handles and faucet than to simply skip the wash. In and out, touch nothing. That is whatâ€™s most sanitary,' argued one. The revelation has led some women to theorize that the reason there is always a line for the women's room â€” and not for the men's â€” isn't because of urinals, but because women are washing their hands and men are not. The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds at a time."
42,US internet providers begin suspending data caps as coronavirus pandemic forces more people to work from home putting increased pressure on home networksÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8109023/US-telcos-begin-suspending-data-caps-amid-coronavirus.html,"US internet providers are suspending data caps and offering free broadband for its customers due to the coronavirus. Comcast and AT&A are the first telcos in the US that are responding to the global health crisis by giving its customers more free calls, texts and internet. The incentives help ensure the virus, which has infected more than 1,600 and killed 41 people in the country, does not hamper emergency response efforts or low-income families. It's also intended to take the financial burden off of home-bound internet users employed by companies that have had to close their offices due to the outbreak. UK providers are now under pressure to introduce similar measures to help limit the amount of fatalities as the coronavirus strain spreads around the country. UK internet providers, including Virgin Media, BT, Three and Sky are yet to respond to comment regarding any upcoming plans to do so. Confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK number about 600, with 10 deaths, as of Friday morning. 'As restrictions due to coronavirus escalate, the need for high quality mobile and broadband services for consumers intensifies,' Kester Mann, network operator analyst for CCS Insight, told MailOnline. Data caps are set by network providers to restrict the amount of data transferred by a customer. If users go over the data cap, usually set as monthly limits, customers are charged a fee or in some cases cut off. Caps are set as thetotal amount of data downloaded per month. At times when more customers are home - such as the current coronavirus pandemic - data caps can be debilitating. 'While providers will be wary that increased demand will put extra strain on their networks, if they have sufficient capacity they could consider temporarily easing some data caps and lifting certain restrictions.' 'This would be particularly relevant for elderly or budget-constrained customers needing to keep regularly updated on fast-moving developments as well as to enable them to stay in regular contact with friends and family.' O2 told MailOnline that it will announce interim measures to support its customers during the outbreak. The company said in a statement: 'Our network stands ready to support the increased number of people working at home through mobile technology. 'We have invested over Â£2 million a day to make sure itâ€™s as robust as possible and is currently managing demand without issue. O2 said its network is designed to â€˜self-optimiseâ€™ â€“ which means that it automatically switches on masts to direct traffic to areas that need it. Meanwhile, TalkTalk said all of its internet packages provide unlimited data, so its customers can already access as much data as they need. In the US, the Federal Communications Commission has said that it has been â€˜coordinating closely with network operatorsâ€™ to introduce the measures, which vary between providers. Comcast has increased the speeds of its â€˜Internet Essentialsâ€™ package that provides broadband basics for low income families, CNET reports. â€˜For millions of low-income Americans who donâ€™t have internet service at home, this uncertain time is going to be even more difficult to manage,â€™ the company said in a blog post. From Monday, March 16, itâ€™s offering new customers 60 days of the service â€“ which normally costs $9.95 a month â€“ for free. Itâ€™s also increasing Internet Essentials speeds for from 15/2 Mbps to 25/3 Mbps for all new and existing customers. AT&T, meanwhile, will lift data caps on some of its broadband plans, aimed at customers who pay on the basis of how much data they use. â€˜Many of our AT&T internet customers already have unlimited home internet access, and we are waiving internet data overage for the remaining customers,â€™ the carrier said in a statement. Verizon claimed that itâ€™s more focused on ensuring first responders in government and health agencies have access to services at times of possible network congestion. While it hasnâ€™t introduced any similar course of action, it says itâ€™s â€˜constantly monitoring data usage and the needs of our customersâ€™. The decision by both providers follows an internet advocacy group calling for the providers to do their part for the public benefit and those â€˜hit hardâ€™ by the illness, officially called COVID-19. US network providers have been pressured by internet advocacy group Free Press to make access to reliable and affordable internet and phone services easier than ever. â€˜Especially during a crisis, internet and phone access should be accessible public services like water and electricity,â€™ said Free Press campaign director Candace Clement. â€˜To minimize disruptions to education, the economy and public life â€“ and to ensure that timely public-health communications are accessible to all â€“ these companies must lower the costs of connectivity for those who struggle to get online or need robust connections to work from home.â€™ Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 4,500 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 125,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 â€“ possibly 9,700 â€“ were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 â€“ doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests â€“ caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world. "
43,"How I beat coronavirus: American woman, 37, describes beating disease with the help of over-the-counter medicine while suffering a headache, tingling arms and legs but NO COUGHING",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8103421/Dont-panic-says-US-woman-recovered-coronavirus.html,"A Washington state woman who has recovered from coronavirus says she experienced no coughing or sneezing and claims she recovered by staying at home and taking over-the-counter medicine. Elizabeth Schneider lives in Seattle, the biggest city in Washington state - which has the highest coronavirus death rate in the United States with 31 people dead. Schneider said she began experiencing flu-like symptoms on February 25, three days after going to a party that was later identified as the place where at least five other people also got infected. The 37-year-old, who has a PhD in bioengineering, said she 'woke up and I was feeling tired, but it was nothing more than what you normally feel when you have to get up and go to work'. She didn't suspect she had the virus as she had been busy in the week before, but by midday she felt a headache coming on, along with a fever and body aches. She decided to leave the office of the biotechnology company where she works as a marketing manager, and went home. After waking up from a nap, Schneider found she had a high temperature, which peaked at 103 degrees Fahrenheit that night (39.4 Celsius). 'And at that point, I started to shiver uncontrollably, and I was getting the chills and getting tingling in my extremities, so that was a little concerning,' she said. She turned to over-the-counter flu medications to treat the symptoms and called a friend to be on standby in case she needed to be taken to an emergency room -- but the fever began to recede in the following days. Schneider had been following news reports about the novel coronavirus. The first US case was detected in Washington in late January. The state has since gone on to become the epicenter of the disease in the country, with 457 cases and 31 deaths. Nationwide, there have been 1,758 cases and 41 deaths. Because she didn't have the most common symptoms like a cough or shortness of breath, 'I thought, okay, well that's definitely why I don't have coronavirus,' said Schneider. She had gotten a flu shot but assumed her illness was a different strain. A visit to the doctor would only result in her being asked to go home, rest and drink plenty of fluids. A few days later, however, she discovered through a friend's Facebook post that several people from the party had all developed similar symptoms, and she began to get more suspicious. Several of these people went to their doctors, where they were found to be negative for the flu, but they were not offered coronavirus tests because they too were not coughing or having breathing trouble. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Knowing that she would also likely be turned down for the test, she decided to enroll in a research program called the Seattle Flu Study, hoping it might provide an answer. The team behind the study sent her a nasal swab kit, which she mailed back and waited several more days. 'I finally got a phone call from one of the research coordinators on Saturday (March 7), telling me that ""You have tested positive for COVID-19,'' she said. 'I was a little bit pleasantly surprised, because I thought it was a little bit cool,' Schneider admitted, laughing, though her mother cried when she told her. 'Granted, I probably would not have felt that way if I was severely ill,' she said. 'But from a scientific curiosity perspective, I thought it was very interesting. And also the fact that I finally got confirmation that that's what I had.' By this time, her symptoms had already subsided, and she was told by local health authorities to remain at home for at least seven days after the onset of symptoms or 72 hours after they subsided. It's now been a week since she's felt better. She has started going out for errands but is still avoiding large gatherings and continuing to work from home. This week, US health authorities citing Chinese data said 80 percent of cases have been mild, while the remaining serious cases that required hospitalization affected mainly people over 60 and those with conditions like diabetes, heart disease or lung disease. By Friday morning there had been 1,758 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 41 deaths in the US. Schneider said she was sharing her story 'to give people a little bit of hope' through her own relatively mild experience with the infection, which she treated herself from home. Schneider said she hoped her example, which will probably be typical of the high majority of cases, could comfort others. But, she added: 'Obviously, it's not something to be completely nonchalant about, because there are a lot of people who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. 'That means that we need to be extra vigilant about staying home, isolating ourselves from others.' 'The message is: don't panic,' said Schneider. 'If you think that you have it, you probably do; you should probably get tested. 'If your symptoms aren't life-threatening, simply stay at home, medicate with over-the-counter medicines, drink lots of water, get a lot of rest and check out the shows you want to binge-watch,' she said. According to Chinese data, one in five patients with COVID-19 may be ill enough to need medical intervention. For the rest wild symptoms, the best medication could be ibuprofen and paracetamol, as this controls fever and pain. In order to help rebuild the immune system post-virus, experts recommend antioxidants which can be obtained from a variety of foods, such as berries, garlic and onion. Vitamin Injections London founder Bianca Estelle has recommended cocktails of vitamins and minerals,intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection, as an alternative to oral supplements which can be harmful to the stomach in high doses. The UK-based clinic administers high doses (dependent on factors including age and health condition. The antiviral concoctions are also great for preventing free radical damage and reducing inflammation caused by viruses. B VITAMINS B Complex vitamins are also help boost the immune system after a viral infection. 'Specifically B6,' Estelle says. 'It gives cells the energy they require to communicate effectively and function.' B6 supports red blood cell production and reduces inflammation. It cannot be made by the body naturally. VITAMIN C Coronavirus victims have reported symptoms of fatigue, body aches, fever, coughing and sneezing. Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant that protects the body against the effects of harmful agents (internal and external) and can negatively affect metabolic processes, leading to tiredness and fatigue. Chinese studies have been treating some infected people with high doses of vitamin C due to its anti-viral properties. Since it has a very low toxicity level, there is no risk of damaging vital organs, as long as the correct dose is administered for an individual as recommended by a health expert. VITAMIN D According to a World Health Organization studyon respiratory tract infections, 'Vitamin D deficiency may affect the immune system as vitamin D plays an immunomodulation role, enhancing innate immunity by up-regulating the expression and secretion of antimicrobial peptides, which boosts mucosal defenses'. Airborne illnesses such as coronavirus can get into the system via mucous membranes; eyes, nose and mouth. Estelle hails the antibacterial and antimicrobial properties of D3, otherwise known as the 'sunshine vitamin'. Darker skin tones have more difficulty obtaining the benefits of vitamin D but slow-release adhesive skin patches provide 12 hours of continuous D3 supplementation, delivered directly into the bloodstream. 'The Vitamin D Shot is a safe treatment,' VitaminInjections.co.uk states. 'Rarely, however, Vitamin D injections can lead to a number of side effects - the most common of which are stomach discomfort and nausea.' MAGNESIUM Magnesium helps reduce inflammation in tissues and regulates the immune system response. Notably it helps keep organs, bones and nerves healthy. Found invegetables, milk, fish, pulses, and grains, about 15 percent is absorbed via oral supplement and it's absorbed at a much higher rate via IV. ZINC Zinc helps flush out damaged cells and fight infection. According to VitaminInjections.co.uk, the trace mineral, stimulates the activities of nearly one hundred enzymes and is necessary for the healthy functioning of the body. Individuals lacking in this nutrient may be more susceptible to illness, meaning that an adequate amount of Zinc should ideally be present in the bodyâ€™s cells. Zinc is recommended for supplementing pre-existing deficiencies in order to enhance the bodyâ€™s natural ability to defend itself against foreign invaders. "
44,Bride-to-be is branded 'selfish' for saying guests are 'dead to her' if they miss her wedding due to the coronavirus epidemic,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8108391/Bride-slammed-saying-guests-dead-miss-wedding-coronavirus.html,"A bride has sparked outrage after telling wedding guests they are 'dead to her' if they miss her wedding due to the coronavirus epidemic. In the original Facebook message, which was later shared onReddit, the anonymous American bride-to-be explained that she is due to tie the knot in 37 days after spending 'thousands' on the big day. She wrote: 'I've spent thousands of dollars. I've been working out, budgeting, dodging family politics land mines, chased rsvps, tried my hand and both electrical and wood work, personalized gifts, answered a million emails, aaand drank lots of wine in the bathtub. 'So I feel justified in remind my guests thatâ€¦ Idon't care. If you miss my wedding because of coronavirus paranoia. You are dead to me.' Unsurprisingly, many Reddit users were quick to take to the comments section to slam the bride-to-be's demands. 'I would be mad too, but damn think about other people than yourself woman,' wrote one, while a second commented:'Cool, so any wedding guests that have anything resembling an autoimmune or chronic illness will risk their lives by attending her wedding. I'm sure that's worth the thousands of dollars she spent on her own entitlement.' A third wrote: 'My cousinâ€™s wedding was supposed to be next weekend, you know what they did? Reschedule it! Because theyâ€™re smart.' A fourth added:'My grandma is almost 90. I see her often. I think itâ€™s terrible to be selfish in a situation like this. Sorry about your wedding but I wouldnâ€™t risk my familyâ€™s health. Deal with it.' The Redditor who took the screengrab of the bride's post went on to explain that the bride had attempted to 'claim satire' after being called out - which added further fuel to the fire. One raged: 'Shout out to my BIL who just canceled their wedding party at the end of the month due to the virus. Are they disappointed? Obviously. Is it what needs to be done right now? Definitely.' A second added: 'A wedding in Brazil had one guest come from Aspen, and he was positive with Corona. Now 200 people are being monitored and might have to be tested. so, unless this girl hands out hand disinfectant as party gifts...' Another further commented: 'It sucks and Iâ€™d be mad if I had to cancel my wedding BUT not mad at guests for not wanting to go to a wedding in a pandemic.' 'Iâ€™d try to cancel as much as I could, get courthouse married and then throw a wedding after the virus is over. I know easier said than done but we are in a pandemic.' Meanwhile, others expressed sympathy for the bride-to-be's situation. 'Iâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™s just expressing her frustration with the situation rather than being serious,' wrote one.'Iâ€™m sure a lot of brides-to-be can sympathize with putting in time and money, and then dealing with the disappointment that your loved ones wonâ€™t show, and that itâ€™s out of your control.' 'Posting this to a wedding group rather than her personal page where all her guests will see it makes it seem more lighthearted.' Another agreed: 'Looks like an obvious joke to me. Wedding planning is stressful even without a pandemic. Let people vent.'"
45,California Governor Gavin Newsom signs executive order allowing the state to take over hotels to house coronavirus patients - hours after calling for an end to gatherings of 250 or more people,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108709/California-Governor-Gavin-Newsom-signs-order-allowing-state-hotels-patients.html,"California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a sweeping executive order allowing the state to commandeer hotels and medical facilities to treat coronavirus patients as cases surged across the state. Newsom also lifted caps on shifts for emergency workers, and cut red tape around re-hiring old staff and which workers are allowed to process coronavirus testing kits. It came just hours after Newsom signed a directive calling for all gatherings of more than 250 people to be cancelled until April, though stopped short of an outright ban. California has confirmed 241 cases of coronavirus including 21 people who tested positive on board the Grand Princess cruise ship. Four people have died in the state so far. A 120-room hotel in San Carlos, near San Francisco, has already been earmarked to house patients from the Grand Princess ship under Newsomâ€™s new order, the Desert Sun reported. â€˜This is where we need to go next, and to make sure we fully implement those procedures and protocols to slow down the spread to get through a peak and to get through the next few months, so we donâ€™t overwhelm our healthcare delivery system,â€™ he said. Asked why he did not go further and issue a legally-binding ban on large gatherings, Newsom said that people appear to be doing the right thing and following guidance. â€˜Why take a step thatâ€™s unnecessary when people are naturally going to do the right thing? Many times, you donâ€™t need to penalize people or even threaten to penalize them,â€™ he said. Underlining his point, Disney announced that its California adventure parks will close until the end of the month â€“ mirroring closures already in force in Hong Kong and Japan. That is despite the fact that amusement parks, casinos and theatres were exempt from the order. Other measures in the order included in the order are a 60-day extension period to the April 15 tax filing deadline to business hit by coronavirus. Newsom also waved a week-long waiting period before workers can claim disability benefit, for those who have caught the disease. Public officials will also be able to teleconference instead of meeting in person without violating laws about holding open meetings. His actions broadly mirror those being taken in other states â€“ such as Ohio and Washington, where large gatherings have also been banned. However, it stopped short of the most extreme measures being used in areas such as New Rochelle, outside New York City, where the National Guard has been called in to enforce a lockdown. The number of coronavirus cases recorded across the US is fast approaching the 2,000 mark with 41 recorded deaths, though experts have warned the true number of cases could be ten time higher. Meanwhile stock markets have tanked 20 per cent into â€˜bear marketâ€™ territory not seen since the 2008 crash as fears over the virus grow. The Trump administration has been widely-criticized for its slow response to the disease, which the President initially downplayed as little worse than the flu. In fact, those researching the disease say it is many times more deadly than seasonal flu â€“ with those over 60 and with underlying health conditions most at risk. Trump on Wednesday announced a ban on all travellers coming to the US from the EUâ€™s 26-nation Schengen borderless zone for 30 days, with US citizens, permanent residents and their relatives exempt. The ban is due to come into effect from Friday at midnight, though it is still largely unclear how it will be enforced. Trump also stopped short of announcing widespread testing or bans on public gatherings and internal travel across the US â€“ measures adopted by other outbreak hotspots such as Italy. Globally, coronavirus has sickened more than 125,000 people and killed almost 5,000. Experts believe it could ultimately infect 70 per cent of the global population, with the potential for hundreds of millions of deaths â€“ making it the deadliest pandemic since Spanish Flu in 1918."
46,Root of all fear: Scientists discover how fear forms in the brain offering hope for the development of an 'off switch' for people with PTSDÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8109701/Fear-memory-PTSD-suppressed-scientists-say.html,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients could receive new treatments after scientists discovered how fear forms in the brain. Biologists in the US say that â€˜fear memoryâ€™ is formed as pathways between two small regions of the brain strengthen following a traumatic event. Experiments on mice brains proved that aversive stimulus caused increased activity between these two regions â€“ called the hippocampus and the amygdala. Finding a way to weaken these connections could erase fear memory and help patients recover from PTSD, they say. â€˜Our study now demonstrates for the first time that the formation of fear memory associated with a context indeed involves the strengthening of the connections between the hippocampus and amygdala,â€™ said Professor Jun-Hyeong Cho at the University of California Riverside. â€˜Our study, therefore, also provides insights into developing therapeutic strategies to suppress maladaptive fear memories in post-traumatic stress disorder patients.â€™ Human brains can form a fear memory associated with a dangerous situation, such as a terrorist situation or a car crash. After horrific events, neural pathways strengthen between the hippocampus and the amygdala â€“ two small but important parts of the brain. The hippocampus responds to a particular context, such as a collision, and encodes it, and the amygdala then triggers defensive behaviour, including fear responses. This association makes us highly adaptive because it lets us learn from past trauma and informs us how to avoid dangerous situations in the future. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult. These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the personâ€™s day-to-day life. PTSD can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event or it can occur weeks, months or even years later. Source: NHS During a car accident, for example, the brain processes a set of multisensory circumstances around the traumatic event, such as visuals and audio, or even smells such as burning materials from a damaged vehicle. â€˜Suppose we had a car accident in a particular place and got severely injured. We would then feel afraid of that â€“ or similar â€“ place even long after we recover from the physical injury,â€™ said Professor Cho. This is because our brains form a memory that associates the car accident with the situation where we experienced the trauma. â€˜This associative memory makes us feel afraid of that, or similar, situation and we avoid such threatening situations. â€˜The neural mechanism of learned fear has an enormous survival value for animals, who must predict danger from seemingly neutral contexts.' However, this process can be dysregulated, leading to exaggerated fear responses that cause PTSD symptoms include nightmares, heightened reactions, anxiety, depression and avoidance of situations that trigger memories of the trauma. PTSD can affect those who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event for months, or even years. A previous study found that one in 13 young people in England and Wales experience post-traumatic stress disorder by the age of 18. An estimated one in 11 people will be diagnosed PTSD in their lifetime, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Is much more common in certain groups including firefighters, war veterans, rape victims and teenage car crash survivors. The team hopes their insights will lead to improved PTSD treatments and now plans to develop strategies to suppress pathological fear memories in PTSD. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications."
47,"American Airlines pilot stationed in Dallas tests positive for coronavirus, with the airline saying the risk to passengers was 'low'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108803/American-Airlines-pilot-stationed-Dallas-tests-positive-coronavirus.html,"An American Airlines pilot based at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport has tested positive for coronavirus. The airline company has not revealed whether the unnamed pilot flies international or domestic routes, nor when they last flew for American. However, an official said they believe the risk of transmission to passengers is low, according to CNN. 'American's Chief Medical Officer and leaders from our pilots' office have been in touch with the pilot,' the company said in a statement yesterday. The news comes after three Transportation Security Administration (TSA) staff who work at Mineta San Jose International Airport in California also tested positive for coronavirus. The TSA confirmed Tuesday that three of its workers at the airport have been struck down with the deadly disease, sending all employees who came into contact with them into quarantine and sparking fears they could have passed the virus on to thousands of passengers. More than 1,700 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States, and 41 people have died as of Thursday evening. About 125,000 people have been infected globally. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. Airlines and travelers are still sorting out the new travel ban that President Donald Trump announced late Wednesday that bars most foreign visitors coming to the U.S. from continental Europe for 30 days. The ban will affect 7,300 flights - and more than 2 million airline seats - scheduled from 26 European nations to the U.S., according to travel data firm Cirium. Airlines are reeling from a drop in travel caused by the new coronavirus, and the ban will add to pressure on carriers, said Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association trade group. 'We have already seen Flybe go under,' he said, referring to a British airline that shut down last week. 'And this latest blow could push others in the same direction.' Meanwhile, travelers are scrambling to figure out how the ban, which starts at midnight Friday, will affect them. WHO IS COVERED BY THE NEW TRAVEL BAN? Most foreign citizens who have been in continental Europe in the 14 days before their scheduled U.S. arrival would be barred. The United Kingdom is not part of the 26-country Schengen Area and will be exempted from the ban, along with Ireland, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine and several other European states. Neither Trump nor the Homeland Security Department explained the reason for leaving out the U.K. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said the U.S. sees the biggest threat coming from the European continent, not the U.K. - although the U.K. has at least 459 confirmed coronavirus cases and eight deaths. The ban doesn't apply to American citizens returning from abroad, at least for now. It also doesn't cover foreigners who are lawful permanent residents of the U.S., or the spouses or children of American citizens and foreign children being adopted by Americans. The official said there are no plans to expand the order to include American citizens or lawful permanent residents who have been to Schengen countries, which have no passport controls within its borders. Trump's executive order also carves out exemptions for airline crews, people on United Nations business, foreigners invited by the U.S. government to help contain the virus, and anyone whose entry is deemed to be 'in the national interest.' WHERE CAN AMERICANS RE-ENTER THE COUNTRY? Like previous bans applying to people who have been in China or Iran, they will be funneled to one of 11 airports: Atlanta; Dallas-Fort Worth; Detroit; Newark, New Jersey; Honolulu; Kennedy Airport in New York; Los Angeles International; Chicago O'Hare; Seattle; San Francisco; and Dulles International outside Washington, D.C. WILL THE BAN PROTECT AMERICANS? Dr. Anthony Fauci, the the National Institutes of Health's top official on infectious diseases, said Thursday that 70% of new infections can be traced to Europe. 'It was pretty compelling that we needed to turn off the source from that region,' he told a congressional panel. Other medical experts are skeptical, noting that the virus is now being passed through so-called community transmission - among people who haven't traveled overseas or been in contact with someone who has. Dr. Bruce Aylward, who led a World Health Organization team in China as the COVID-19 disease was surging last month, said countries might gain in the short term by limiting travel but overall 'it doesn't help to restrict movement.' HOW DOES THE OUTBREAK COMPARE TO PAST CRISES FOR THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY? The combination of the drop in demand, widespread and growing restrictions on travel, and uncertainty over how long it will last is unprecedented, even by the U.S. travel industry's decline after the 2001 terror attacks and the brief but sharp downturn in global travel during the SARS outbreak in Asia in 2002. Security measures after 9/11 made the few passengers who kept flying feel safe, and they sensed things would get better, said Seth Kaplan, a transportation analyst and longtime industry observer. 'This is new territory. You have a 9/11-like drop in demand, but you can't tell people that you're absolutely safe to fly - you're not absolutely safe around any group of people,' Kaplan said. WHICH FLIGHTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE BAN? American Airlines said late Thursday it will suspend flights to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Munich and Zurich on Friday. It will fly to Paris, Madrid and Barcelona for up to seven more days before stopping those routes. It will reduce flights to London. American hopes to resume the flights starting in early May. Delta said Thursday that it will suspend seven routes between the U.S. and Europe after Friday. United Airlines said it will fly its normal schedule to Europe through March 19, then cut back from an average of 63 flights a day to about 34 a day while monitoring demand. Delta, United and American all said they were capping fares on flights from Europe to the U.S. They are also waiving fees for changing or canceling tickets through April 30. Germany's Lufthansa Group said it will keep flying to Chicago and the New York and Washington, D.C., areas from Frankfurt, Zurich, Vienna and Brussels to maintain 'at least some air traffic connections to the USA.' But it will stop U.S.-bound flights from Munich, Geneva and Duesseldorf. The group's subsidiaries include Lufthansa and Austrian, Swiss and Brussels airlines. Norwegian Air said it would cancel most of its flights to the U.S. but operate flights from London normally. The budget carrier announced other schedule reductions too, and said it would furlough up to half its employees. WILL AIRLINES ASK FOR GOVERNMENT HELP? Airline officials say they haven't asked for assistance - yet. After a decade of heady profits, U.S. airlines are much stronger financially than they were after the 2001 terror attacks, when they got government help. The longer the virus disrupts travel, however, the more likely a bailout becomes. Airlines are lining up more credit from banks to preserve liquidity. They are slashing capital spending. They could cancel or defer aircraft orders, although none have announced such moves. The trigger on a request for aid could be the kind of massive airline layoffs that followed 9/11. Most airlines have already frozen hiring and asked workers to take unpaid leave. 'These airlines are not yet on the precipice of going out of business, but if they feel they can't responsibly avoid furloughs to save the company, at that point they could go to the government,' Kaplan said."

As the virus courses through the world, the story of two outbreaks illustrates a coming problem for countries now grappling with an explosion in cases. It's impractical to test every potential patient, but unless the authorities can find a way to see how widespread infection is, their best answer is lockdown. Italy started out testing widely, then narrowed the focus so that now, the authorities don't have to process hundreds of thousands of tests. But there's a trade-off: They can't see what's coming and are trying to curb the movements of the country's entire population of 60 million people to contain the disease. Even Pope Francis, who has a cold and delivered his Sunday blessing over the internet from inside the Vatican, said he felt 'caged in the library.' Thousands of miles away in South Korea, authorities have a different response to a similar-sized outbreak. They are testing hundreds of thousands of people for infections and tracking potential carriers like detectives, using cell phone and satellite technology. Both countries saw their first cases of the disease called COVID-19 in late January. South Korea has since reported 67 deaths out of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases, after testing more than 222,000 people. In contrast, Italy has had 1,016 deaths and identified more than 15,000 cases after carrying out more than 73,000 tests on an unspecified number of people. Epidemiologists say it is not possible to compare the numbers directly. But some say the dramatically different outcomes point to an important insight: Aggressive and sustained testing is a powerful tool for fighting the virus. Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, said extensive testing can give countries a better picture of the extent of an outbreak. When testing in a country is limited, he said, the authorities have to take bolder actions to limit movement of people. 'I'm uncomfortable with enforced lockdown-type movement restrictions,' he said. 'China did that, but China is able to do that. China has a population that will comply with that.' The democracies of Italy and South Korea are useful case studies for countries such as America, which have had problems setting up testing systems and are weeks behind on the infection curve. So far, in Japan and the United States particularly, the full scale of the problem is not yet visible. Germany has not experienced significant testing constraints, but Chancellor Angela Merkel warned her people on Wednesday that since 60% to 70% of the populace is likely to be infected, the only option is containment. South Korea, which has a slightly smaller population than Italy at about 50 million people, has around 29,000 people in self-quarantine. It has imposed lockdowns on some facilities and at least one apartment complex hit hardest by outbreaks. But so far no entire regions have been cut off. Seoul says it is building on lessons learned from an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and working to make as much information available as possible to the public. It has embarked on a massive testing programme, including people who have very mild illness, or perhaps don't even have symptoms, but who may be able to infect others. This includes enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease. The authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves - or their friends and family members - tested. In addition to helping work out who to test, South Korea's data-driven system helps hospitals manage their pipeline of cases. People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through a smartphone app, or checked regularly in telephone calls, until a hospital bed becomes available. When a bed is available, an ambulance picks the person up and takes the patient to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms. All of this, including hospitalization, is free of charge. South Korea's response is not perfect. While more than 209,000 people have tested negative there, results are still pending on about 18,000 others - an information gap that means there are likely more cases in the pipeline. The rate of newly confirmed cases has dropped since a peak in mid-February, but the system's greatest test may still be ahead as authorities try to track and contain new clusters. South Korea does not have enough protective masks - it has started rationing them - and it is trying to hire more trained staff to process tests and map cases. And the approach comes at the cost of some privacy. South Korea's system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in Europe and America, would be a fundamental right of privacy. Unlike China and the island-state of Singapore, which have used similar methods, South Korea is a large democracy with a population that is quick to protest policies it does not like. 'Disclosing information about patients always comes with privacy infringement issues,' said Choi Jaewook, a preventive medicine professor at Korea University and a senior official at the Korean Medical Association. Disclosures 'should be strictly limited' to patients' movements, and 'it shouldn't be about their age, their sex, or their employers.' Traditional responses such as locking down affected areas and isolating patients can be only modestly effective, and may cause problems in open societies, says South Korea's Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip. In South Korea's experience, he told reporters on Monday, lockdowns mean people participate less in tracing contacts they may have had. 'Such an approach,' he said, 'is close-minded, coercive, and inflexible.' ITALY 'AT THE LIMIT' Italy and South Korea are more than 5,000 miles apart, but there are several similarities when it comes to coronavirus. Both countries' main outbreaks were initially clustered in smaller cities or towns, rather than in a major metropolis - which meant the disease quickly threatened local health services. And both involved doctors who decided to ignore testing guidelines. Italy's epidemic kicked off last month. A local man with flu symptoms was diagnosed after he had told medical staff he had not been to China and discharged himself, said Massimo Lombardo, head of local hospital services in Lodi. The diagnosis was only made after the 38-year-old, whose name has only been given as Mattia, returned to the hospital. Testing guidelines at the time said it was not necessary to test people who had no link to China or other affected areas. But an anaesthetist pushed the protocols and decided to go ahead and test for COVID-19 anyway, Lombardo said. Now, some experts in Italy believe Mattia may have been infected through Germany, rather than China. Decisions about testing hinge partly on what can be done with people who test positive, at a time when the healthcare system is already under stress. In Italy at first, regional authorities tested widely and counted all positive results in the published total, even if people did not have symptoms. Then, a few days after the patient known as Mattia was found to have COVID-19, Italy changed tack, only testing and announcing cases of people with symptoms. The authorities said this was the most effective use of resources: The risk of contagion seemed lower from patients with no symptoms, and limited tests help produce reliable results more quickly. The approach carried risks: People with no symptoms still can be infected and spread the virus. On the other hand, the more you test the more you find, so testing in large numbers can put hospital systems under strain, said Massimo Antonelli, director of intensive care at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. Testing involves elaborate medical processes and follow-up. 'The problem is actively searching for cases,' he said. 'It means simply the numbers are big.' Italy has a generally efficient health system, according to international studies. Its universal healthcare receives funding below the European Union average but is comparable with South Korea's, at 8.9% of GDP against 7.3% in South Korea, according to the World Health Organization. Now, that system has been knocked off balance. Staff are being brought into accident and emergency departments, holidays have been cancelled and doctors say they are delaying non-urgent operations to free up intensive care beds. Pier Luigi Viale, head of the infectious disease unit at Sant' Orsola-Malpighi hospital in Bologna, is working around the clock - in three jobs. His hospital is handling multiple coronavirus cases. His doctors are shuttling to other hospitals and clinics in the area to lend their expertise and help out with cases. In addition, his doctors also have to deal with patients with other contagious diseases who are struggling to survive. 'If it drags on for weeks or months we'll need more reinforcements,' he told Reuters. Last week, the mayor of Castiglione d'Adda, a town of about 5,000 people in Lombardy's 'red zone' which was the first to be locked down, made an urgent online appeal for help. He said his small town had had to close its hospital and was left with one doctor to treat more than 100 coronavirus patients. Three of the town's four doctors were sick or in self quarantine. 'Doctors and nurses are at the limit,' said a nurse from the hospital where Mattia was taken in. 'If you have to manage people under artificial respiration you have to be watching them constantly, you can't look after the new cases that come in.' Studies so far suggest that every positive case of coronavirus can infect two other people, so local authorities in Lombardy have warned that the region's hospitals face a serious crisis if the spread continues - not just for COVID-19 patients but also for others whose treatment has been delayed or disrupted. As the crisis spreads into Italy's less prosperous south, the problems will be magnified. Intensive care facilities face the most intense pressure. They require specialist staff and expensive equipment and are not set up for mass epidemics. In total, Italy has around 5,000 intensive care beds. In the winter months, some of these are already occupied by patients with respiratory problems. Lombardy and Veneto have just over 1,800 intensive care beds between public and private systems, only some of which can be set aside for COVID-19 patients. The government has asked regional authorities to increase the number of intensive care places by 50% and to double the number of beds for respiratory and contagious diseases, while reorganising staff rosters to ensure adequate staffing. Some 5,000 respirators have been acquired for intensive care stations, the first of which are due to arrive on Friday, deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said. The region has already asked nursing institutes to allow students to bring forward their graduation to get more nurses into the system early. Pools of intensive care specialists and anaesthetists are to be set up, including staff from outside the worst affected regions. To add to the burden, hospitals in Italy depend on medical personnel to try to trace the contacts that people who test positive have had with others. One doctor in Bologna, who asked not to be named, said he had spent a 12-hour day tracing people who had been in contact with just one positive patient, to ensure those who next need testing are found. 'You can do that if the number of cases remains two to three,' the doctor said. 'But if they grow, something has to give. The system will implode if we continue to test everyone actively and then have to do all this.' 'MAXIMUM POWER' In South Korea as in Italy, an early case of COVID-19 was identified when a medical officer followed their intuition, rather than the official guidelines, on testing. The country's first case was a 35-year-old Chinese woman who tested positive on Jan. 20. But the largest outbreak was detected after the 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman from South Korea's southeastern city of Daegu, was diagnosed on Feb. 18. Like the patient named Mattia in Italy, the woman had no known links to Wuhan, the Chinese province where the disease was first identified. And as in Italy, the doctors' decision to recommend a test went against guidelines at the time to test people who had been to China or been in contact with a confirmed case, said Korea Medical Association's Choi Jaewook. 'Patient 31,' as she became known, was a member of a secretive church which Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip said has since linked to 61% of cases. Infections spread beyond the congregation after the funeral of a relative of the church's founder was held at a nearby hospital, and there were several other smaller clusters around the country. Once the church cluster was identified, South Korea opened around 50 drive-through testing facilities around the country. In empty parking lots, medical staff in protective clothing lean into cars to check their passengers for fever or breathing difficulties, and if needed, collect samples. The process usually takes about 10 minutes, and people usually receive the results in a text reminding them to wash their hands regularly and wear face masks. A total of 117 institutions in South Korea have equipment to conduct the tests, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The numbers fluctuate daily, but an average of 12,000 is possible, and maximum capacity is 20,000 tests a day. The government pays for tests of people with symptoms, if referred by a doctor. Otherwise, people who want to be tested can pay up to 170,000 won ($140), said an official at a company called Seegene Inc, which supplies 80% of the country's kits and says it can test 96 samples at once. There are also 130 quarantine officers like Kim Jeong-hwan, who focus on minute details to track potential patients. The 28-year-old public health doctor spends his whole working days remotely checking up on people who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Kim, who is doing military service, is one of a small army of quarantine officers who track the movements of any potential carriers of the disease by phone, app or the signals sent by cell phones or the black boxes in automobiles. Their goal: To trace all the contacts people may have had, so they too can be tested. 'I haven't seen anyone telling bad lies,' Kim said. 'But lots of people generally don't remember exactly what they did.' Underlining their determination, quarantine officers told Reuters they located five cases after a worker in a small town caught the virus and went to work in a 'coin karaoke,' a bar where a machine lets people sing a few songs for a dollar. At first, the woman, who was showing symptoms, did not tell the officers where she worked, local officials told Reuters. But they put the puzzle together after questioning her acquaintances and obtaining GPS locations on her mobile device. 'Now, quarantine officers have maximum power and authority,' said Kim Jun-geun, an official at Changnyeong County who collects information from quarantine officers. South Korea's government also uses location data to customize mass messages sent to cellphones, notifying every resident when and where a nearby case is confirmed. Lee Hee-young, a preventative medicine expert who is also running the coronavirus response team in South Korea's Gyeonggi province, said South Korea has gone some of the way after MERS to increase its infrastructure to respond to infectious diseases. But she said only 30% of the changes the country needs have happened. For instance, she said, maintaining a trained workforce and up-to-date infrastructure at smaller hospitals isn't easy. 'Until we fix this,' Lee said, 'explosions like this can keep blowing up anywhere.'

50,"America's coronavirus response is FAILING, admits top health official Anthony Fauci as he says 'the system is not really geared to what we need right now'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8105535/Tony-Fauci-admits-Americans-tested-easily-calls-FAILING.html,"Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted in front of the House Oversight Committee Thursday that Americans are not able to get tested for the coronavirus 'easily' and called it a 'failing.' 'The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we're not,' Fauci said on Capitol Hill. 'That is a failing. It is a failing. Let's admit it,' he also said. Less than an hour later, President Trump boasted that testing in the U.S. for coronavirus is cases 'is going very smooth.' Yahoo News reported Thursday that Americans states are, on average, testing fewer than 100 people per day, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tested just 77 people in the first two days of this week. Fauci returned to Capitol Hill Thursday to sit on a panel of experts before the House committee and jumped in to respond to an inquiry by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, who was prodding Robert Redfield, the DCD director, on who's in charge of green-lighting testing for Americans if they want it. Wasserman Schultz brought up cases in which healthcare workers, namely nurses, had been denied testing. Redfield didn't give Wasserman Schultz a direct answer, instead explaining that the CDC's job is to get tests public health labs. 'Itâ€™s really the engagement of the private sector to get these tests into clinical medicine, which is a partnership between the private sector and CDC,' Redfield explained. Wasserman Schultz asked, 'Basically you're saying ... there's not one person that can ensure that these tests can be administered? Yes or no?' Fauci then joined the conversation explaining that the U.S. medical system is not set up in such a way to make widespread testing easy. 'The system is not really geared to what we need right now - what you are asking for,' Fauci said. Later on in the hearing Fauci also said that patients heading into individual doctors' offices is also not ideal 'The system was geared for the individual doctor-patient, what we're dealing with now transcends that,' Fauci said. On the other end of Pennsylvania, Trump was presenting the testing issues with a much more positive spin. 'They have a million tests out now. Over the next few days they'll have 4 million tests out,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he held a bilateral meeting with Irish Prime MinisterLeo Varadkar."
51,Late night TV is canceled! Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon suspend shows for the next two weeks and Seth Myers says he doesn't know when taping will resume after New York declares coronavirus emergency,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107501/Seth-Meyers-Stephen-Colbert-Jimmy-Fallon-suspend-shows-amid-New-York-coronavirus-epidemic.html,"Three of late night TV's shows have been suspended after New York declared a state of emergency on Thursday. NBC announced The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon would air its last episode until March 30 while The Late Night with Seth Meyers was halted after celebrity guests refused to show up. As planned by all late night TV shows in the city, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert filmed without a studio audience Thursday but around 9pm CBS announced a new episode wouldn't air until at least the next 18 days. Meyers explained: 'So we were planning on doing our show tonight and then on Monday we were gonna start doing it without an audience but basically things are moving very fast, I don't need to tell you that. 'Our guests, with great reason, decided that they didn't feel right coming in and doing the show tonight so we decided to cancel it and we don't know when we're going to start doing shows again.' Meyers then went on to explain they were still going ahead with their A Closer Look segment written the night before, joking that it was because 'once its on the [cue] card, Wally makes us do it'. He explained in a tweet later on: 'We canceled our show tonight but had a CLOSER LOOK ready to go and as it was relevant we decided to record it in the studio for some of our staff before we all headed home. Stay safe, everyone.' NBCUniversal chief executive, Jeff Shell, 'strongly' encouraged employees to start working from home on Thursday. The same day Fallon filmed with guests Dr Oz, Mandy Moore and Dane DeHaan and joked about cheap flights, cancellation and the state of emergency amid the outbreak. The show tweeted around 9.30pm: 'We've been monitoring the current situation here in New York and the safety of our staff, crew guests and our studios audiences are out #1 priority. 'For that reason we have decided that we will not tape any new shows effective Friday, March 13. The Tonight Show is planning on resuming a normal taping schedule on March 30.' Colbert had earlier tweeted: 'In light of recent developments in NYC, we'll be without an audience tonight in the Ed Sullivan Theater, but we're here with an all-new show featuring CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent.' Sharing an image of an empty studio a few hours later, the social media account teased that Colbert 'has something very different coming up tonight'. It's believed the suspensions could put pressure on other shows to stop filming altogether. On Wednesday, all New York-based late shows - including ones from Trevor Noah, John Oliver, Samantha Bee and Greg Gutfeld - said they would tape their broadcasts in theaters and studios without audience members. 'God forbid you stay on the air too long and someone in the building gets hurt by this,' David Letterman's former late-night show executive producer Rob Burnett,told the New York Times Thursday. 'That transcends anything you might be doing on television. It's a very challenging situation.' The Wednesday announcement from New York networks came as Donald Trump enforced a European travel ban due to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from abroad. Shortly afterward House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted the president for failing to do enough to prevent community spread. Westchester County - 148 New York City - 95 Nassau County - 41 Suffolk County - 20 Rockland County - 7 Ulster County - 4 Saratoga County - 3 Orange County - 2 Albany - 2 Monroe - 2 Broome - 1 Delaware - 1 Dutchess - 1 Herkimer - 1 New York State Total - 328 'Per guidance from New York City officials, the company is hoping to do its part to help to decrease the rate of transmission in our communities,' the NBC statement read. 'Our shows will continue filming on their regular schedule, and currently, there will be no impact on air dates.' 'For several weeks, the team at the theater has been taking all necessary precautions to protect everyone who enters and works in the theater with enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures,CBS said in a statement. 'For the past several weeks, The Late Show producers have consulted daily to share information with other New York-based late night shows, who will also be moving forward without an audience.' In statements, the shows indicated their staffers were well, but that producers felt performing with live crowds would not be safe or smart. TBS' Full Frontal with Samantha Bee started the policy Wednesday evening. 'Bee says she will instead 'do the show in front of a mirror, which I actually prefer',' the statement joked. 'Despite the efforts being taken, we still have heard from Sean Spicer that tonight's taping 'was the largest audience ever to witness an [taping of Full Frontal], period, both in person and around the globe.' Wow!' There was no immediate information provided on whether NBC's Saturday Night Live would use a live audience for its coming rehearsals or broadcasts. The show's next original episode is not scheduled until March 28. At CBS the pandemic spread beyond live audience shows. Also Wednesday, the network said production on the 41st edition of Survivor has been postponed in response to the spread of the coronavirus. Filming was scheduled to begin later this month in Fiji, but CBS now says production will start on May 19. Thursday Trumpsaid a domestic travel ban is a possibility if gets 'too hot' in certain areas of the US. 'You see what they're doing in New Rochelle, which is good frankly,' Trump continued from his base in Washington DC. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  In New Rochelle, a city of nearly 80,000 people, a one-mile containment area is now in effect. It's where 148 of New York's 328 coronavirus cases have been reported. Referring to the city just north of Manhattan, Trump added: 'It's the right thing, but it's not enforced, it's not very strong. But people know they're being watched. New Rochelle, that's a hot spot.' The suburb of about 80,000 residents is at the center of an outbreak of more than 120 cases in Westchester County, out of 240 statewide as of Wednesday. There are now 95 confirmed cases in New York City, 45 more than yesterday. Twenty-two of the 95 people currently fighting the virus have been hospitalized. The New York City breakdown is as follows; 25 in Manhattan, 24 Brooklyn, 17 in Queens, 10 in the Bronx and five in Staten Island. New York City's population is more than 100 times that of New Rochelle. The NYC mayor predicts that by next week, there will be 1,000 cases of coronavirus in New York City. The state of emergency allows de Blasio to now activate a range of extreme measures including a curfew, closing down public transport, prohibiting people from being on the streets, rationing and limiting alcohol use. He has not implemented any of those measures, but the declaration of a state of emergency allows him to at any time. Gatherings of more than 500 people have now been banned and de Blasio warned sports arenas like the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden will remain nonoperational for months. Public spaces - like bars and restaurants - must now operate at 50 percent of their legal capacity. Schools will remain open, he said, but activities like school plays, recitals, PTA meetings and assemblies, that can be moved online will be. City workers who cannot work from home will now be staggered in their shifts. He urged New York City businesses to encourage telecommuting - ie working from home - and staggering staff shifts as 'much as possible'. President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced a drastic ban on foreigners traveling to the United States from Europe in an effort to curb the deadly coronavirus from spreading, but his vague plan seemed to only heighten fears. Americans in Europe rushed to airports late on Wednesday and early on Thursday morning in a desperate bid to get home, before confusion over who would be affected by the ban was cleared up. While U.S. citizens and lawful residents will be allowed to return home, most foreigners from the 26 banned countries will be denied entry beginning on Friday. Here, DailyMail.com details what we know - and more crucially what we don't know. WHO IS COVERED BY THE BAN?  Foreigners who are traveling directly from any of the 26 countries on Trump's European ban list will not be admitted into the United States. Foreigner means anyone coming from outside the U.S. and is not a U.S. citizen or doesn't have a valid green card. The countries include EU members France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. See right for the full list. It is unclear if passengers flying from a non-European destination will be asked when they were last in Europe. Foreigners who are in the U.S. on a work visa or a tourist visa are likely going to barred from entering the U.S. if they visit a European country and try to re-enter the country. WHO IS NOTCOVERED BY THE BAN? The restrictions don't apply to U.S. citizens, legal U.S. permanent residents, meaning those with green cards, immediate family members of U.S. citizens or others 'identified in the proclamation' that was signed by Trump on Wednesday night. It also doesn't apply to foreigners with diplomatic, NATO, military or government visas. And for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have a foreign child or are adopting a foreign child, according to NAFSA. Americans who are currently in Europe will be allowed back in â€” though they will be subject to an 'enhanced' health screening and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. Trump did not mention any restrictions on Americans traveling to Europe and the ban will last for 30 days. WHAT ABOUT FOREIGNERS COMING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES? WILL THEY BE ASKED IF THEY WENT TO BANNED DESTINATIONS? It is unclear how airports will be screening for foreigners who have visited an European country and later traveled to another country that isn't on the ban list. For example, London's Heathrow airport is a major travel hub for Europe and is exempt from the ban, meaning Europeans could possibly travel to London to fly out to the U.S. Heathrow's most popular destination is JFK in New York City. Heathrow has a daily average total of 219,458 passengers, with 49.5 percent of those passengers classified as departures. Around 94 percent of passengers who travel out of Heathrow are coming or going to international destinations. Several international airlines also have designated layovers in cities worldwide, meaning passengers might be able to travel to Asia or other North American countries and bypass the ban if screening officials aren't being thorough. WHAT HAPPENS TO AMERICANS WHEN THEY TRAVEL FROM EUROPE? Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday that Americans returning from Europe 'will be screened as they return through 13 separate airports.' Currently, there are 11 airports that are designated to receive passengers who recently visited China or Iran, which had previous travel restrictions placed on them. The airports in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas, Hawaii andDetroit could possibly be utilized to accept travelers from the European countries. It was not mentioned if screening included testing for every passenger. It is unclear how passengers are expected to self-quarantine when they still need to travel home from the airport, particularly if the airport they are routed through is not close to their final destination. Trump on Thursday encouraged travelers to self-isolate after returning from Europe. HOW EXACTLY ARE PEOPLE SCREENED FOR CORONAVIRUS? In addition to the passenger being asked if they have visited any of the banned European countries, officials look for symptoms of the virus. The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and fatigue. To confirm if a passenger has coronavirus, a sample is collected for a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, which is the strain of virus that leads to the respiratory disease. Medical officials often take a sample by putting a swab up the nose. A swab can also be taken through the mouth if the person has a wet cough. The samples are sent off to be tested by various health departments and clinical diagnostic laboratories.Results usually come back within 2-7 days. In Cleveland, a clinic said a new in-house coronavirus test it developed would deliver results within eight hours. WHO WILL ENFORCE THE BAN? It is unclear who will be responsible for enforcing the ban. International airlines could be tasked with denying boarding for European passport holders at the gate or at check-in. Another option could see European passengers beingturned away at the U.S. border if they somehow made it on a U.S-bound flight. Additionally, it is unclear if the government will use federal resources to send additional officials to check passports and enforce the ban at airports. CAN AIRPORTS EVEN TEST FOR CORONAVIRUS? One of the main concerns over the spread of the virus has been over a shortage of testing kits available, asVice President Mike Pence said passengers will be tested at one of the 13 airports upon arrival. Airports and local clinics have repeatedly said they did not have supplies to test people who are concerned they have the virus. It has been reported that fewer than 10,000 people have been tested in the U.S. compared to 20,000 per day in South Korea. The CDC revealed on Tuesday that only 8,554 Americans had been tested for coronavirus, with the agency's director saying state and local health labs are understaffed and ill-equipped to keep up with the crisis. Health officials and Democrats have slammed the limited supply of tests, while some government officials claimed there was a surplus of testing kits, citing figures of 1.1 million tests at labs across the country and a million more on the way. However during the coronavirus task force briefing, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, confessed that Americans will only be able to find out whether they have contracted COVID-19 if a doctor gives the go-ahead. Despite a claimed 4 million more tests due to be delivered by the end of the week, Azar said: 'There's a false premise. Just because I as a person say I'd like to be tested for coronavirus, I can walk into a Minute Clinic and say ''give me my test please'' â€“ that's not how diagnostic testing works in the United States or frankly anywhere else.' Why wasn't the United Kingdom included in the ban? Despite the UK having 373 cases and Ireland having 43 cases, in addition to the UK imposing far fewer restrictions in response to the virus than many EU countries, Trump's travel ban excluded the two.Trump has properties in both nations. Trump said on Thursday: 'One of the reasons UK basically has been (excluded from the restrictions is) itâ€™s got the border. 'Itâ€™s got very strong borders and theyâ€™re doing a very good job.' The exemption will raise questions about the coherence of his policy. Trump had accused Europe of not acting quickly enough to address the 'foreign virus' and claimed that U.S. clusters were 'seeded' by European travelers. But the UK has no screening of people coming from France - to which it is connected directly by the Channel Tunnel - or other European countries, as Nancy Pelosi quickly pointed out. On Thursday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of America's top scientists, explained the ban on European countries. He said: 'When we were looking at the pure public health aspect of it we found that 70 percent of the new infections in the world were coming from Europe, that cluster of countries, and of the 35 states - 30 out of 35 of them who were more recently getting infections were getting them from them - that was predominantly from Italy and from France and from Germany.' How many people does this affect? Europe is the most popular international destination for Americans and according to flight tracker FlightAware, there are around 400 flights across the Atlantic from Europe to the United States each day, converting to around 72 million passengers a year. Although Americans aren't outright barred from traveling to Europe, many have already cancelled bookings to European cities. The time of year the ban falls under is when several grade schools and universities have spring break. What do health officials say about the Europe ban? Some evidence has suggested travel restrictions â€“ such as the ones imposed in China early on in the pandemic â€“ can contain the virus by stopping cases being imported to the rest of the world. Margaret Harris, of the World Health Organisation, admitted that travel bans are useful in the early stages of an outbreak but said they are of little use when the disease starts spreading freely within communities â€“ as it has done in the U.S. Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease specialist at the University of East Anglia, said: 'It is uncertain what the US intends to achieve with the recently announced travel ban to the Schengen area of Europe. Hunter continued: 'Many of us have been pointing out since the COVID-19 epidemic began that travel bans have a poor record on preventing the spread of epidemic diseases. At best travel bans only delay the spread of an epidemic by a short while. 'Introducing an international travel ban at a time when the US is now one of the countries with the most rapidly accelerating internal transmission rates will do little if anything to reduce the burden of infection within the US.' What does this mean for the tourism and airline industry?  The globaltravel industry is already reeling from declining bookings and canceled reservations as people try to avoid contracting and spreading coronavirus. With Europe being the most popular travel destination for Americans, the move will hit tourist reliant-heavy countries hard. Airlines scrambled to adjust to the new restrictions, with many telling customers they were still assessing options and asking for patience from those trying to contact them. Even before Trump's announcement, the International Airline Travelers Association was forecasting a 24 percent fall in Europe's passenger traffic this year and $37 billion in lost potential ticket sales. Italy, which is all but closed off as authorities try to control the spread of the virus there, has been particularly hard hit. An industry trade group warned that airlines worldwide could lose up to $113 billion in revenue from the virus â€” several times the damage caused by the 2001 terror attacks in the U.S. Since mid-February, shares of American Airlines have dropped by nearly half, United Airlines by more than one-third, and Delta Air Lines more than one-fourth."
52,"Divorce rate spikes across China after 'couples spend too much time together during coronavirus home quarantine', officials claim",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108385/Divorce-cases-spike-China-couples-spend-time-coronavirus-quarantine.html,"Divorce rates in China have risen significantly because 'couples are spending too much time together at home' during coronavirus self-isolation, according to register offices across the country. Over 300 couples have scheduled appointments to get a divorce since February 24, said Lu Shijun, the manager of a marriage registry in Dazhou, Sichuan Province of south-western China. Officials believe the sharp increase of divorce requests could be caused by the fact that partners have spent too much time in close quarters under quarantine. 'The divorce rate [in the district] has soared compared to before [the coronavirus outbreak],' Mr Lu told the local press yesterday. 'Young people are spending a lot of time at home. They tend to get into heated arguments because of something petty and rush into getting a divorce,' Mr Lu explained. Another factor could be a result of delayed applications due to the council offices closing for nearly a month during the coronavirus epidemic. Marriage registration offices in Xi'an of Shaanxi Province in north-western China have also seen an unprecedented rise of divorce appointments since re-opening on March 1, according to reports. One district office received 14 requests in one day, hitting the upper limit set by the local council, a registration officer told Global Times. Officials in Fuzhou, Fujian Province of southern China, have adjusted the number of divorce appointments to 10 couples a day after receiving an overwhelming amount of requests. Scientists have been debating about whether spending time in close quarters is beneficial for couples. A 2018 study foundcouples who lived together before marriage had lower divorce rates in the first year, compared to couples who didn't. But higher divorce rates appeared after people living with their spouses for five years or longer. Another research showedliving together could protect lovers against getting a divorce. Cities around China have ordered their citizens to self-isolate for over a month to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The news comes as China sees only 8 new cases today, the lowest since the outbreak first started in January. Elsewhere,Coronaviruspanic has tightened its grip worldwide yesterday as scores of countries dramatically upped their response to the deadly pandemic. Nearly 133,000 people have been infected with the deadly disease worldwide. The death toll has also risen to 4,960. It has led to several countries being effectively put into lockdown as they closed schools, mass events and shops, while in the US, the mayor of New York declared a state of emergency in the city. Millions are locked down and more than 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus in Italy. Prime Minister Boris Johnson today held an emergency meeting where he declared the UK's tactics will shift from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread. He branded the coronavirus as the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off implementing drastic measures. He said:'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time. 'This is more dangerous [thanseasonal flu] and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.' A total of 596 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, up from 456 on Wednesday, the Department of Health said. And two more patients have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total to 10, NHS England said."
53,'When you don't have a real audience you have to fake one - just like Trump's inauguration': Pete Buttigieg hosts Jimmy Kimmel and jokes about lack of audience due to coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109133/Pete-Buttigieg-hosts-Jimmy-Kimmel-jokes-lack-audience-coronavirus.html,"Former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg filled in for Jimmy Kimmel Thursday without a studio audience as other late night hosts took similar precautions because of coronavirus concerns. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor joked, 'When you don't have a real audience, you have to fake one, just like Trump's inauguration,' in a reference to US President Donald Trump having pictures of his inauguration edited to show larger crowds. Instead of a studio audience, Buttigieg had a small group of Kimmel's staffers and a few guests, including his husband Chasten. Buttigieg, jobless now that he was no longer in the presidential race, was given a shot at hosting his first late night show.It was not clear if there was another reason for Kimmel's absence. A spokeswoman for the show did not respond immediately when DailyMail.com reached out. The changes on the show and others were being made in response to the coronavirus outbreak which has infected thousands around the globe. The US has 1,776 confirmed cases and knows of 41 people who have died from the outbreak. Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon also recorded their shows without an audience on Thursday.Trevor Noah and James Corden announced that they would forego having studio audiences starting next week. Seth Meyers delivered his 'A Closer Look' segment in a digital clip that only aired on YouTube and not on NBC after the network chose to suspend production on his and Fallon's show after Thursday, at least until March 30th. Colbert, recorded before an audience in New York's Ed Sullivan Theater, also was suspending production. Buttigieg, who stood in for Kimmel because of his jobless status after dropping out of the 2020 presidential race, assured Americans the nation is 'strong', as many have been gripped in fear by the spread of the pandemic. 'Believe me when I say â€” that the resolve of our nation is strong. Our ideals run deep, and America will always be America,' he said. 'In fact, here is living proof of that.' But for most of his monologue, the first time late show host focused on being funny. While Buttigieg discussed the outbreak and impacts on the country, he also reminded that the US was holding up as one might expect, pointing to a clip from Wednesday's episode of 'Masked Singer,' where former Alaska governor Sarah Palin was the featured performer singing the the 1990s rap hit 'Baby Got Back'. 'That's gonna be me in three months, isn't it?' Buttigieg joked. Buttigieg also joked about dropping out of the presidential race. 'I really thought we had a shot. Turns out I was 40 years too young and 38 years too gay,' he said. Buttigieg, if he had won the election, would have been the country's first gay president. He added that he was grateful he might inspire young Americans. 'One day, I too can run for president while dressed like the manager of a CarMax,' in a joke that made fun of his vanilla, or plain, fashion style. President Trump's live address to the nation Wednesday was fodder for some of the hosts after he used a teleprompter and still made several errors in his report on the virus, including saying that all travel from Europe was to be suspended, when Americans and some others are exempt, and that insurance would waive copayments for CODVID-19 treatment, when insurers are only covering testing, not treatment. Trump also described the virus as 'foreign'. 'I would understand if Trump made mistakes, right, if this whole thing was off the cuff. But how is it possible to get so many things wrong in a prewritten speech? This is crazy! Watching an Oval address shouldn't be a game of Two Truths and a Lie', Noah said about the president's address. 'It isn't a foreign virus. It's just a virus, OK? Trump makes it sound like corona doesn't speak English', Noah added. Colbert, imitating Trump, said, 'Please remember, very important for all countries and businesses to know, nothing I say is true, pay no attention to the man behind the bronzer'. 'During his address, Trump said starting Friday people from Europe can't fly to the US. He was like, 'We have to stop the virus so instead of everyone flying here, I want everyone to take a cruise,' joked Fallon.  "
54,EPL stops matches until April 4 as all professional soccer in England is halted for three weeks after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta catches coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108035/Chelsea-star-tests-positive-coronavirus-hours-Arsenal-manager-Mikel-Arteta-diagnosed.html,"The rest of the English football season may now never happen after it was suspended from today for at least three weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for the infection. The Premier League, the Championship, League One, League Two, FA Women's Super League and FA Women's Championship have all halted competitive action immediately â€“ along with the FA Cup quarter-finals. England's two friendlies on March 27 and 31 at Wembley have also been postponed â€“ while next week's Champions League and Europa League ties were called off and the European Championships in June are now under threat. But with the situation expected to get worse, it is by no means certain that the season will restart on April 3 - and the packed football calendar could make it impossible to fit in every match before scheduled end date of May 17. Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow said it was uncertain whether the Premier League season would be completed. 'We have no idea, we hope so,' he said, after leaving a meeting today at the League's office in London. However, English non-league fixtures are still due to go ahead with the National League deciding to allow matches in its three divisions to proceed this weekend - offering an option to football fans left without a game to attend. North of the border, Scottish football today announced an immediate suspension across all leagues, with every match - including Sunday's Old Firm clash between Rangers and Celtic at Ibrox - postponed until 'further notice'. The Football Association of Wales also decided to suspend domestic football at all levels in Wales, until April 4. Government advice on mass gatherings in England has not changed despite the decision to move into the 'delay' phase in tackling the virus, but the spread of the illness among competitors has forced the hand of organisers. It follows players and staff being affected by coronavirus, or individuals self-isolating as a precaution after reporting the symptoms. Three Leicester players are being tested and Everton's squad are now in self-isolation. In other sports: The Premier League is suspended until April 4, with the Football League off until April 3 - when Blackburn Rovers play Leeds United in the Championship, which is currently the next scheduled professional match in England.  Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said: 'Above all, we wish Mikel Arteta and Callum Hudson-Odoi speedy recoveries, and everyone else affected by COVID-19. 'In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, Government, the FA and EFL and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority.' The Premier League said it aims to reschedule the displaced fixtures 'when it is safe to do so', adding: 'In this fast-moving environment, further updates will be provided when appropriate.' All of these major sporting events in the UK had been scheduled to take place over the next three months:  OFF STILL ON An EFL spokesman said: 'The FA, Premier League, EFL and Barclays FA Women's Super League and FA Women's Championship have collectively agreed to postpone the professional game in England until April 3 at the earliest. 'This action, which will be kept under constant review, has been taken due to the increasing numbers of clubs taking steps to isolate their players and staff because of the COVID-19 virus. 'The postponements include all matches in the Championship, League One and League Two, as well as all academy and youth team fixtures. 'In addition, clubs are being advised to suspend indefinitely all non-essential activities which include, but are not limited to, player appearances, training ground visits and fan meetings.' Adam French, consumer rights expert at Which?, said: 'Football fans worried about being left out of pocket as a result of these games being postponed should keep hold of their tickets until they know if they can make the new dates. 'If you're unable to make it to a game once it's been rescheduled, then you'll be entitled to a refund. 'It could be harder to get a refund on any travel or accommodation booked for the match, unless it was purchased as part of a package deal. Check the cancellation policies of any travel or accommodation you have booked.' Last night, Arteta, 37, became the first confirmed member of staff of a Premier League team to contract the disease, which was officially labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on Wednesday. News of Arteta's diagnosis yesterday came less than an hour after the Premier League announced that this weekend's fixtures would still be played as planned â€“ a decision which was then changed this morning. Arteta and the entire first-team squad and coaching staff, will now be self-isolating in accordance with the most recent government guidelines. Chelsea announced Hudson-Odoi, 19, had tested positive with coronavirus at around midnight and said the training facility in Cobham, Surrey, will be partially closed. Hudson-Odoi said in a video posted to Twitter this morning: 'Hi guys, as you may be aware, I had the virus for the last couple of days, which I've recovered from. I'm following the health guidelines and self-isolating myself from everybody for the week. I hope to see everybody soon, and hopefully be back on the pitch very soon. Take care.' West Ham have announced several members of club personnel are self-isolating after being in close contact with Arteta at Saturday's match with Arsenal and the club's stadium and training facilities are closed and will be deep cleaned. A club statement read: 'Due to members of West Ham personnel being in direct contact with the Arsenal manager at our game at Emirates Stadium at the weekend, the club is taking a precautionary approach and those individuals are now self-isolating, in line with Government health guidelines.' Hammers manager David Moyes was seen to embrace his opposite number before kick-off at the Emirates Stadium and the pair then shook hands at full-time. Catherine West MP, Labour's Shadow Minister for Sport, said: 'With the spread of the coronavirus, it is regrettably the right decision to suspend the football season. The welfare of fans, players and officials must come first. 'It is vital that fans are not left out of pocket. Many pay thousands of pounds for season tickets, and clubs must work together to ensure that all fans are properly compensated.' The Professional Footballers' Association responded with full support for the postponement of fixtures. BT Sport will not refund subscribers who now face at least three weeks without live coverage of the Premier League and Champions League, it was claimed today. The broadcaster, which also has rights to The FA Cup, Europa League and the German Bundesliga, is hoping that live football will resume soon following mass cancellations amid the coronavirus outbreak. But subscribers, many of whom pay Â£29.99 a month, are now facing a schedule of repeated matches, wrestling films and documentaries. Sky Sports will also now no longer have any live Premier League and Football League action, while the FA Cup quarter-final matches on the BBC are canceleled. Sources at BT Sport told The Guardian that it cannot refund customers for the lack of live sports this month. Sky's position on refunds is not yet clear. A BT spokesman said: 'We apologise to customers about the changes to the BT Sport schedule this month due to the impact of Covid-19. 'The situation is evolving rapidly and we are working with the leagues to continue to broadcast live sport wherever possible and broadcast games when they are rescheduled over the coming months. 'We will continue to broadcast a wide range of BT Sport content including films and documentaries and we will update our customers as we have a clearer view of the remainder of the season.' The company's own chief executive Philip Jansen has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating. A statement posted on Twitter read: 'The PFA welcomes the decision from the Premier League and English Football League to suspend games until 3rd April 2020. 'We have been in regular dialogue with both the leagues and have communicated direct concerns from PFA delegates and senior players on behalf of their respective squads. The leagues shared these concerns.' Everton's first-team squad have been told to stay at home after one player went into seven-day self-isolation as a precaution against the threat of coronavirus. One player reported a high temperature on Thursday night and the club responded by closing the training ground and advising other staff to stay away from Goodison Park and its corporate headquarters at the Royal Liver Building. 'A player reported a high temperature on Thursday night and is now undertaking a period of self-isolation for seven days,' said a club statement. 'In line with Government guidelines no other players are self-isolating at this stage but the club's USM training facility has been closed as a precaution and staff, including players, have been advised to stay away from all club sites until further notice. 'The club is in regular contact with the player in question and is monitoring the wellbeing of all players and staff. 'The health, welfare and safety of all Everton players, staff and stakeholders is the club's absolute priority.' Yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of Cobra emergency committee in which he refused to ban mass gatherings or shut schools despite saying 'many loved ones' will die during the escalating crisis. It is understood Arteta did not come into contact with Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who also tested positive, during their Europa League game on February 27. There are over 590 confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, and 10 people have died from it so far. Nearly 5,000 people have died worldwide, and the number of cases has shot up to over 130,000. Sport continued to be hit by the coronavirus outbreak on Friday with more events cancelled and further individuals forced to self-isolate as the virus spreads. Here, the PA news agency takes a look at how the morning unfolded: The prime minister yesterday branded the virus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die, but still held off drastic measures. At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. Mr Johnson said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives. The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises. But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said yesterday evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'. Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance also said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees. The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10 to 14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. A spokesman for Chelsea said the teenage midfielder became unwell and had the symptoms of a 'mild cold' and hoped their staff will be back to work soon. The statement said: 'Chelsea men's team player Callum Hudson-Odoi had a positive test result for Coronavirus returned this evening [Thursday]. 'Chelsea personnel who had recent close contact with the player in the men's team building will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. 'These will include initially the full men's team squad, coaching staff and a number of backroom staff. 'It is expected that those who did not have close contact with Callum will return to work in the coming days. In the meantime, the men's team building, one of several separate buildings at our training ground, will remain closed. The rest of our training facility, Stamford Bridge and our other facilities are operating as normal. 'Callum displayed symptoms similar to a mild cold on Monday morning and has not been at the training ground since then as a precaution. 'However, his test came in positive this evening and he will undergo a period of self-isolation. Despite testing positive for the virus, Callum is doing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible.' Arsenal played Olympiacos in the Europa League a couple of weeks ago, and since then the Greek club's owner Evangelos Marinakis has tested positive for the virus. Wolves' match against Olympiacos yesterday evening was played behind closed doors as a precaution. Most of Europe's top leagues have either suspended matches or will play games with no crowd until further notice. Arsenal have closed down the London Colney training centre after the manager received a positive coronavirus result yesterday evening. First team players participated in a training session there on Tuesday afternoon. A number of people from the Hale End Academy will also be in self-isolation, and the facility has been closed as a precaution as well. Both training centres will undergo a deep clean. Anyone who has not come into close contact with Arteta is expected to return to work within the next few days. Arteta said: 'This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I'm allowed.' SATURDAY SUNDAY MONDAY All matches have now been postponed along with every Premier League fixture until at least April 4 Over the past week, Arsenal have played against Portsmouth in the FA Cup, and West Ham in the Premier League. Handshakes were banned for the Premier League match, however Arteta still came into physical contact with a number of people during the game. He fist bumped Bukayo Saka at full-time, and also embraced assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg, after hugging rival manager David Moyes before the game. Juventus revealed on Thursday that 121 people, including players, directors, and staff are now in self-isolation after defender Daniele Rugani tested positive for coronavirus. Sampdoria striker Manolo Gabbiadini has also tested positive, with Italy one of the worst-hit countries. Three Leicester players are in self-isolation and Chelsea have cancelled a training session in order to deep clean their own facility. Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy is also in self-isolation after one of his family members tested positive. On an unprecedented day of cancellations football league programmes in Spain, Portugal, Holland and the United States were suspended alongside postponements in rugby, tennis, golf, basketball and athletics. The coronavirus outbreak continues to have an impact on the sporting schedule as some of 2020's biggest events come into view. A range of sports have had to take action to prevent the spread of the virus, with postponements hitting the Premier League, Guinness Six Nations and Formula One, while all domestic sporting action in Italy has been suspended until April 3 at the earliest.

55,Superheroes can't save it! Marvel movie Shang-Chi shooting in Sydney postponed over coronavirus fears as director goes into self-isolation on the advice of his doctorÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8108099/Marvel-Studios-suspends-production-kung-fu-movie-Australia-director-awaits-coronavirus-test.html,"Production was suspended on an upcoming Marvel Studios kung-fu movie filming in Australia as director Destin Daniel Cretton awaits results of a coronavirus test. The Australian crew was told that first-unit production on Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings was being suspended as Cretton, 41, was under self-isolation, according to an article Thursday by The Hollywood Reporter. Cretton has a newborn baby and made the decision to get tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and Marvel Studios 'in an abundance of caution' decided to suspend first-unit production until his test results come back. Shang-Chi was not shutting down with second unit and other parts of production continuing. The film based on the Marvel Comics superhero Shang-Chi will mark the character's live-action debut. Shang-Chi will be played by Canadian actor Simu Liu, 30, who will become the first Asian actor to lead a Marvel Studios film. The comic book character was created in the early 1970s by writer Steve Englehart, 72, and artist Jim Starlin, 70, who also created Marvel characters Thanos, Drax The Destroyer and Gamora. The Shang-Chi movie due out in February 2021 also will star Tony Leung, 57, as the Mandarin and Awkwafina, 31, in an undisclosed role. The note to the film's crew read: 'As many of you know, Destin, our director, has a new born baby. He wanted to exercise additional caution given the current environment and decided to get tested for COVID-19 today. He is currently self-isolating under the recommendation of his doctor. While he waits for the results of the test, we are suspending 1st unit production in an abundance of caution until he gets the results this coming week. Second unit and off production will continue as normal. We will reach out to everyone by Tuesday for the latest update.' 'This is an unprecedented time. We appreciate everyoneâ€™s understanding as we work through this,' the statement added. Warner Bros. earlier this week halted pre-production of its Elvis Presley biopic in Australia after star Tom Hanks, 63, tested positive for COVID-19 along with his wife Rita Wilson, 63. Hanks and Wilson remain in isolation in Australia after testing positive."
56,"ISIS issues advice to terrorists on how to tackle coronavirus - including a travel ban, washing hands, and 'putting your faith in God'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108525/ISIS-issues-advice-terrorists-tackle-coronavirus-including-putting-faith-God.html,"ISIS has issued guidance for terrorists on how to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. A list of 'religious directives' on tackling infectious diseases appeared in the latest issue of the terror group's newspaper al-Naba. The list includes 'stay away from sick people', 'wash your hands before eating' and 'avoid travel to affected areas' â€“ similar to advice being issued by world governments. But it also includes decrees such as 'put your faith in God and seek refuge in him'. Jihadists are also told 'illnesses do not strike by themselves but by the command and decree of God.' While ISIS has lost almost all of its so-called caliphate in the Middle East, it is thought to still hold pockets of territory across Iraq and Syria. Iraq has so far reported 79 cases of coronavirus with eight deaths â€“ a death rate of 10 per cent, suggesting the actual number of infections is much higher. Syria has not reported any cases of coronavirus, but with the government only in control of parts of the country and the healthcare system in ruins after years of civil war it is possible cases are going undetected. Iran is by far the worst-affected country in the Middle East with at least 10,000 cases and hundreds of deaths, though observers believe the true toll is far higher. Recently-revealed satellite images suggest mass graves are being dug in Qom, the city at the centre of the outbreak, to house the bodies of victims. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Oman and Kuwait have all reported cases â€“ largely in people who have returned from travel in Iran. ISIS also holds territory in West Africa including in Burkina Faso, which has reported a small number of cases, and close to Nigeria which is also affected. Globally, more than 125,000 have contracted coronavirus while deaths from the disease were approaching 5,000 as of Friday morning. However, experts in many countries are warning the true number of cases could be ten times higher than reported because they cannot test everyone. The UK has said that those with mild symptoms should self-isolate and will not be tested until they need hospital treatment. Meanwhile the US CDC admitted only carrying out 77 tests for the virus in the past week, despite President Trump pledging to test 'millions'. The World Health Organisation has officially declared coronavirus a global pandemic â€“ meaning it is spreading out of control in multiple parts of the world simultaneously â€“ and urged government to take immediate action to curb its spread. Measures being adopted by affected countries include 'social distancing' â€“ like closing schools, banning large gatherings and shutting offices â€“ to slow the spread of the disease. Because the virus is new, humans have no natural immunity to it, meaning it spreads rapidly. Governments such as Germany are warning that up to 70 per cent of the population will catch it, meaning billions of infections worldwide and the potential for hundreds of millions of deaths. While the majority of cases are mild, around 20 per cent become serious â€“ with the elderly and those with underlying conditions most at risk. Because the virus spreads so rapidly, that has led to hospitals being overwhelmed and death rates spiking in affected regions. Advice to prevent the spread of the virus includes washing hands regularly with soap, coughing and sneezing into a tissue or crooked elbow, and avoiding large crowds and poorly-ventilated spaces. "
57,Queen Letizia tests negative for coronavirus: Spanish royal is given all-clear after minister she kissed during meeting was found to be infectedÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108471/Queen-Letizia-tests-negative-coronavirus.html,"Queen Letizia of Spain has been given the all-clear after she was tested for the coronavirus following a kiss on the cheek with an infected government minister last week. A Spanish Royal family spokesman said her husband, King Felipe VI, has also been cleared after tests. The monarchs were tested yesterday after it emerged a government minister former journalist Letizia had met recently had been diagnosed with the disease. She shook hands with equality minister Irene Montero as she arrived at an event last Friday in Madrid which they both attended. And the pair were pictured giving each other the traditional Spanish kiss on the cheek as Letizia left the meeting with an association caring for prostitutes. Confirmation the monarchs had been tested came after it was announced Mrs Montero had become the first Spanish government minister to go down with coronavirus. She and her partner Pedro Iglesias, one of Spainâ€™s deputy PMs, have both been quarantined. On Wednesday the Spanish royals had lunch with French president Emmanuelle Macron and his wife at the Elysee Palace. The number of coronavirus infectees who have died in Spain now stands at 87 with more than 3,000 people affected. The country is facing demands for an Italian-style nationwide lockdown. A lockdown is already in place for four towns in the province of Barcelona. People have been told they can only leave or enter the areas in emergencies. All schools and universities in Spain will close from Monday over fears of the spread of coronavirus as the country saw a 80 per cent rise in deaths, it emerged today. The move comes asQueen Letizia ofSpainwas tested for coronavirus after a government minister she met recently was diagnosed with the disease. Educational centres in some areas like Catalonia and Galicia will shut tomorrow and the rest will shut on Monday. Schools in Madrid and La Rioja closed earlier this week. The closures are due to last for a fortnight, although regional government chiefs have already warned they could be extended. Reports in Portugal say schools there will also close from Monday until the end of the month. Spain placed four towns under quarantine today and announced measures to tackle the economic impact of the epidemic, which the country's hoteliers described as a 'tsunami' threatening the survival of their businesses. From 8pm four towns around the village of Igualada - 30 miles north of Barcelona - were placed on indefinite lockdown after a significant outbreak in the area, top regional police official Eduard Sallent told reporters. It is the first such restriction imposed in Spain since the outbreak began. Earlier today it was revealed that the former journalist, now Queen of Spain, shook hands with equality minister Irene Montero as she arrived at an event they both attended last Friday in Madrid. And the pair were pictured giving each other the traditional Spanish kiss on the cheek as Letizia left the meeting with an association caring for prostitutes. Confirmation the royal had been tested along with Spanish King Felipe VI came after it was announced Mrs Montero had become the first Spanish government minister to go down with coronavirus. She and her partner Pedro Iglesias, one of Spain's deputy PMs, have both been quarantined. A Spanish Royal Family spokesman confirmed the tests on the monarchs were taking place because of Queen Letizia's 'recent public activity' and government advice. The results are expected to be made public tomorrow. Catalonia's regional government ordered Spain's first lockdown since the start of the crisis in four municipalities. The Italian-style lockdown, preventing people from entering or leaving the four areas, began to operate at 9pm on Thursday night, although people were told they would be allowed past a police checkpoint until midnight if needed. The affected areas - Igualada, Vilanova del Cami, Santa Margarida de Montbui and Odena - are all in the province of Barcelona. The lockdown is expected to affect up to 76,000 people. People who do not live in the four municipalities or need to return to their homes there from elsewhere have been given an extra three hours to enter or leave the four areas but will need to pass a police checkpoint. The emergency measure was brought in after an outbreak which badly affected Igualada Hospital and has caused three deaths and left 49 people including 33 health workers infected. Spain, which initially did little in response to the outbreak, changed tack this week after infections soared. It ordered a ban on flights from Italy and warned against domestic and foreign travel. Schools and universities will be closed across the country for at least two weeks, while the prison service cut back visiting rights across its facilities. On the economic front, funds will be directed to central and regional health authorities, prices of drugs and medical equipment will be capped, and the tourism sector will also receive financial support. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most common symptoms are: Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  There was little fresh money, however, in the 18 billion euros package announced by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, with some already earmarked payments simply brought forward. The bulk of the package goes towards allowing small businesses to make split or delayed tax payments over the next six months. King Felipe VI has cancelled a meeting he was due to hold today with Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic. Sanchez told a news conference: 'These are difficult moments but we will overcome then. We will overcome this with unity and responsibility from all.' Spain's coronavirus death toll rose to 84 on Thursday, a rise of nearly 80 per cent overnight. Spain has the second-highest coronavirus tally in Europe behind Italy. On Sunday Queen Letizia came into close contact with the basketball players in the final of the Spanish Queen Cup. She handed the winning team the trophy at Sanchez Paraiso stadium. She also sat in the crowd to watch as Perfumerias Avenida played against Spar CityLift Girona. On Wednesday the Spanish royals had lunch with French president Emmanuelle Macron and his wife at the Elysee Palace. The number of people to die with coronavirus in Spain has now reached 86. At 1pm today the number of coronavirus cases stood at 2,968, 816 more than yesterday. Nearly 1,400 are in Madrid, where schools were ordered to shut yesterday for two weeks. Real Madrid's footballers were also put in quarantine today after it emerged a Real Madrid basketball player had tested positive for coronavirus. Spain's government underwent coronavirus testing after the number of cases soared to 2,968. It is up from 2,140 on Wednesday evening, with deaths leaping from 48 to 84 within the same time frame. 'This morning, all members of the government will undergo testing,' a statement said, indicating the results would be published later in the day. 'The minister (Irene Montero) is in a good condition and second deputy prime minister Pablo Iglesias is also in quarantine due to the situation.' Mrs Montero tested positive on Wednesday evening, three days after appearing at a mass march of some 120,000 people through Madrid for International Women's Day. A special cabinet meeting to discuss an emergency plan of action to respond to the crisis went ahead at midday as planned, with PM Sanchez and 14 other ministers, it said. However, all of Sanchez's upcoming appointments would be conducted by video conference. Spain has seen the number of infections spiral since the start of the week, becoming one of the worst-hit countries in Europe. Madrid has borne the brunt of the crisis with 1,388 infections and 38 deaths. The International Women's Day demonstration on Sunday evening took place just hours before health authorities detected a huge spike in infections. Meanwhile occupancy rates at Spanish hotels have fallen dramatically, with some hotels left empty, and there are 'no new bookings',according to a top official at Spain's hotels and tourist accommodations federation CEHAT revealed. 'A tsunami has arrived. A meteorite has fallen on us and we have to see how we survive,' CEHAT Secretary General Ramon Estalella said, urging the Spanish government to take measures to avoid bankruptcies and layoffs at hotel companies. The lower house of parliament, already shut, will extend its closure, Cadena Ser radio said. Health Minister Salvador Illa cancelled plans to speak in parliament about the coronavirus in what would have been an exception to the suspension. Sanchez will head a reduced cabinet meeting on Thursday only attended by the ministers whose presence is needed to approve new measures to stop coronavirus spreading. The cabinet is set to approve a package of measures to mitigate the economic impact of the outbreak. In Madrid, the impact of the virus and measures taken to combat it have already had an impact, with metro stations and bars unusually quiet. 'Business has gone down a lot, really a lot,' said JosÃ© Manuel GonzÃ¡lez, the 58-year old manager of the Santa Barbara cafe. 'It's very quiet at lunchtime, things have dropped by 40- 50 per cent since the school shutdown. That's when things started to change.' As #Imstayingathome became a top trending topic on Twitter in Spain, 20-year-old student Alejandro Fernandez said his grandparents had fled Madrid. 'My grandparents, who are 84 and 81 years old, have left for the countryside and locked themselves up there. We have orders not to go visit them,' Fernandez said. After the Prado and other major museums in Madrid, Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedral said it was closing. Madrid health authorities asked people to donate blood, after a drop in donations in recent days. Doctors in the capital say they could run out of beds in intensive care units. China sent a shipment of masks and other medical supplies to help Spain and Italy contain the outbreak. Madrid health authorities asked people to donate blood, after a drop in blood donations over the past days. Doctors in the capital have said over the past days that they were worried they could run out of beds in intensive care units."
58,Pandemic? What pandemic? Thousands of spring break revelers defy coronavirus fears as they party in Miami Beach - hours after the city issued a state of emergency,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109093/Thousands-spring-break-revelers-defy-coronavirus-fears-party-Miami.html,"Schools and universities across the United States are closing as the coronavirus impacts American's everyday lives, but that hasn't stopped young folks from partying it up in Miami for spring break. Photos show scantily clad revelers taking to Miami Beach on Thursday just hours after the city announced a state of emergency in the midst of the global pandemic. Gen Zers could be seen pouring cans of Limeritas and other alcoholic drinks on twerking girls in the ocean. And contrasting the surgical mask and gloves that have become a regular visual in the States, these party-goers sported swim suits and trunks. There did appear to be one person with a mask on his face, but one has to wonder what purpose that mask was really serving in that moment. Folks also went against the social distancing that's been advised by the CDC, choosing to jump on each other's back and slapping each other's butts. Couples could be seen hugged up out on the water. And while bottles of Hennessy were in abundance, Spring Breakers did appear to try to stay hydrated with water. Florida currently has 45 of the 1,758 cases of those infected with the virus in the United States. Just two of those cases are in the Miami-Dade area, according to figuresfrom the Florida Health Department. Roughly seven people were arrested along Ocean Drive on Wednesday as police got into altercations with Spring Breakers. Six of those people were charged with resisting an officer without violence. Shocking video showed one officer and a woman colliding into each other in the commotion, only for the cop to then choke the woman and kick her down before arresting her. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said on Thursday that City Manager Jimmy Morales had declared a state of emergency in the city. The move granted the city managers special powers to close private clubs, limit beach access and install a curfew for the next three days, the Miami Heraldreports. Gelber said that under the state of emergency, they city can and will suspend or refuse to pull special-event permits for large gatherings of more than 250 people for the next 30 days. Included in this time frame are the city-sponsored spring break concerts in South Beach and the Miami Beach Pride festival. 'To the extent that anybody can declare spring break is over, it is over this year,' Gelber said. 'We are the point of an economic engine, and it's incumbent on us to make sure that we lead the way in this effort.' Public beaches will remain open, for the time being. Major venues have been closing."
59,Now Lindsey Graham self-quarantines and is tested for coronavirus amid fears of outbreak at Mar-a-Lago after Brazilian president's aide who was at party caught disease,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106987/Lindsey-Graham-self-quarantine-coronavirus-test-Brazilian-leaders-aide-infected.html,"Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said he will self-quarantine and be tested for coronavirus after mingling with the Brazilian President and his infected aide at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. President Donald Trump will learn on Friday whether Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to reports out of Brazil, after the two men dined together at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night and shook hands. Bolsonaro was checkedfor the disease after his aideFabio Wajngarten tested positive for it butSouth Carolina senator Graham said Thursday he doesn't recall touching the leader or the infected staff member. 'Senator Graham was at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. He has no recollection of direct contact with the President of Brazil, who is awaiting results of a coronavirus test, or his spokesman who tested positive,' Graham's office said in a statement. 'However, in an abundance of caution and upon the advice of his doctor, Senator Graham has decided to self-quarantine awaiting the results of a coronavirus test. This is a precautionary measure. He will continue to work from home.' Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida also said that he will self-quarantine after he met with the Brazil delegation, which included Wajngarten. Senator Scott said in a statement on Thursday that, when he met with the president in Brazil in Miami on Monday, he was in the same room as theWajngarten. 'While I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me,' Scott said. 'The embassy said the person had no symptoms leading up to or the day of the conference,' he noted.'After consulting with the Senate's attending physician and my personal doctor, I have been told that my risk is low, and I don't need to take a test or quarantine.' He said, however, he would self-quarantine out of 'an abundance of caution.' 'I am feeling healthy and not experiencing any symptoms at this time,' Scott said. President Trump,who was photographed standing next to Wajngartenn and Vice President Mike Pence at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night, said Thursday he was 'not concerned' about possibly contracting the virus. 'Let's put it this way: I'm not concerned,' Trump told reporters Thursday while meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office. Several members of the first family were at the Winter White House that night where there was a birthday party for Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., in addition to the working dinner for the Brazilian delegation. Wajngarten, who was at the dinner and the birthday party, tested positive for the virus, setting off a chain of events on Thursday, including a test for his boss. Brazil has 25 confirmed cases of coronavirus and zero deaths thus far. The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald reported Bolsonaro took the test: 'The result should be ready. But the presidential palace is now saying the result will only be released Friday, which likely means he had a second test, and that one takes longer,' he wrote on Twitter. A columnist for the newspaper, Monica Bergamo, said Wajngarten was tested for coronavirus at the Albert Einstein Hospital in SÃ£o Paulo on Wednesday. His test result was positive, multiple news outlets reported. In the photo he posted on Instagram from the Saturday night events at Mar-a-Lago, Wajngarten is standing next to Trump wearing a 'Make Brazil great again' cap. Vice President Mike Pence was next to Trump. In addition to the working dinner at Mar-a-Lago, there was a birthday party for Guilfoyle, attended by several members of the first family and many Trump allies. Spotted at the lavish bash: Donald Trump Jr., her boyfriend of almost two years; Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump;Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner; Tiffany Trump; Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney; Republican Senator Lindsey Graham; and Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida. Fox News host Tucker Carlson was also there as was National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien;Senator Rand Paulâ€™s Deputy Chief of Staff Sergio Gor, Fox Newsâ€™ Jesse Watters and his wife Emma Watters; and new acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham addressed the situation before reports of Bolsonaro's test. 'The White House is aware of public reports that a member of the Brazilian delegation's visit to Mar-a-Lago last weekend tested positive for COVID-19; confirmatory testing is pending. Exposures from the case are being assessed, which will dictate next steps. Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,' she said, referring toWajngarten. 'As stated before, the White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service has been working closely with various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the First & Second Families, and all White House staff healthy,' she noted. 'To reiterate CDC guidelines, there is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine,' Grisham said.'We are monitoring the situation closely and will update everyone as we get more information.' As of Thursday night, there have been more than 1,716 reported cases of coronavirus in the United States. At least 41 people had died. The encounter was the latest brush Trump has had with the coronavirus. An attendee at CPAC, the annual conservative conference that the president addressed at the end of February, tested positive for the virus. The American Conservative Union, which sponsors the conference, was quick to say the person had no direct contact with Trump or Pence, who also spoke. But three lawmakers went into self-quarantine because they did and all had contact with the president: new White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Rep. Doug Collins and Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz was also at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night for the dinner and birthday party. Additionally, the Florida Republican flew back to Washington D.C. with the president on Air Force One on Monday. Last month, Trump said he was not concerned about contracting the virus after a man in his 50s who attended the three-day Conservative Political Action Conference that began on February 26. The American Conservative Union, the organization that runs CPAC, insisted the patient had no contact with either Trump or Pence at the conservative gathering in National Harbor, Maryland. 'A New Jersey hospital tested the person, and CDC confirmed the positive result,' the ACU said. 'The individual is under the care of medical professionals in the state of New Jersey, and has been quarantined.' The attendee did not listen to any speeches in the main hall, the ACU confirmed. Several senior White House officials attended the event, including White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump, White House senior counselor Jared Kushner, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway and the former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Donald Trump Jr was also there as were several members of the president's cabinet including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Health and Human Service Secretary Alex Azar, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to reporters that precautions were being taken although she did not offer specifics. 'The White House is aware of an individual testing positive for coronavirus after attending the CPAC conference that took place nearly two weeks ago. At this time, there is no indication that either President Trump or Vice President Pence met with or were in close proximity to the attendee. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  'The president's physician and United States Secret Service have been working closely with White House staff and various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the first family and the entire White House complex safe and healthy,' she said.' Donald Trump Jr did not come into contact with the individual at CPAC, a spokesman said. 'It has been confirmed that Don did not come into contact with the individual that tested positive,' said a spokesman for the president's son told DailyMail.com. Earlier this week, aleading New York doctor and political ally of SenatorTed Cruzwent into self-quarantine over fears he has coronavirus. Alan Berger, a 55-year-old gynecologist who works for NYU Langone Health, volunteered to isolate himself and is no longer seeing patients, the facility confirmed in a statement. Berger has hosted fundraisers for Texas Republican Cruz in his hometown of Englewood, New Jersey and is said to be friendly with President Donald Trump's in laws, the Kushners. Authorities have not commented on suggestions Berger is the 'patient zero' who interacted with Cruz and Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, at CPAC. The CPAC patient was described as a 55-year-old man who was recovering in New Jersey; Dr. Berger is a 55-year-old man who has self-isolated in New Jersey. New Jersey authorities have confirmed that a 55-year-old man from Englewood was quarantined for a presumptive positive attended CPAC. He was in stable condition and has been hospitalized since March 4, The Englewood man attended services at a temple in New Rochelle, New York, according to New Jersey commissioner of health Judith Persichille. Schlapp shook hands with the president and mingled with Ivanka Trump, Lara Trump and Jared Kushner during the event in Washington, D.C,'s Maryland suburbs but says he's 'healthy as a horse' and has urged attendees not to panic. Cruz, however, announced last Sunday: 'Last night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for COVID-19. 'That interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.' It was later announced that a second lawmaker, Arizona Republican Paul Gosar, and three members of his staff had also gone into quarantine following 'contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus.' By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready."
60,Donald Trump is 'very concerned' about coming into contact with people with coronavirus as Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro awaits test results after his aide caught virus following dinner at Mar-A-Lago,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107907/Donald-Trump-concerned-hes-exposed-people-coronavirus.html,"Donald Trump is reportedly concerned that he's been exposed to people who have contracted the killer coronavirus, including a Brazilian official who tested positive for the disease days after meeting the President at Mar-a-Lago.  Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and his Press Secretary Fabio Wajngarten and sat down for a dinner together on Saturday. On Thursday Wajngarten tested positive for COVID-19. 'He is very concerned about all the people he met who have it, including the Brazilian,' a source said to CNN on the president's concerns. The president has still not been tested for the novel coronavirus, the White House said. Wajngarten posted an Instagram photo of himself beaming with Trump and Pence and holding a Make Brazil Great Again cap on Monday. President Bolsonaro was tested for the contagious virus Thursday, just days after he called the global pandemic a 'fantasy'. He is currently being monitored for the virus. Bolsonaro shared a Facebook live wearing a face mask on Thursday evening, where he said he expects the results of his coronavirus test in the coming hours. 'I believe in the next hours we will have the result from [my test] and from some other people who were with me,' Bolsonaro said, referring to others who traveled to the United States with him last weekend. The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald reported Bolsonaro took the test: 'The result should be ready. But the presidential palace is now saying the result will only be released Friday, which likely means he had a second test, and that one takes longer,' he wrote on Twitter. In Brazil there are at least 34 confirmed cases as of Thursday. Despite his private worries, Trump put on a confident front before the nation. 'Let's put it this way: I'm not concerned,' Trump told reporters Thursday while meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office. 'We did nothing very unusual, we sat next to each other for a period of time,' he added. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement stating that Trump and Pence do not require testing. 'Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time,' she said. 'The White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service has been working closely with various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the First & Second Families, and all White House staff healthy,' she added Several members of the first family were at the Winter White House on Saturday night where they threw a birthday party for Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., in addition to the working dinner for the Brazilian delegation. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he would self-quarantine and be tested for the virus. The South Carolina senator was at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. 'Senator Graham was at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. He has no recollection of direct contact with the President of Brazil, who is awaiting results of a coronavirus test, or his spokesman who tested positive,' Graham's office said in a statement. 'However, in an abundance of caution and upon the advice of his doctor, Senator Graham has decided to self-quarantine awaiting the results of a coronavirus test. This is a precautionary measure. He will continue to work from home,' his office noted. Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida also said that he will self-quarantine after he met with the Brazil delegation, which included Wajngarten. The encounter was the latest brush Trump has had with the coronavirus. An attendee at CPAC, the annual conservative conference that the president addressed at the end of February, tested positive for the virus. The American Conservative Union, which sponsors the conference, was quick to say the person had no direct contact with Trump or Pence, who also spoke. But three lawmakers went into self-quarantine because they did and all had contact with the president: new White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Rep. Doug Collins and Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz was also at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night for the dinner and birthday party. Additionally, the Florida Republican flew back to Washington D.C. with the president on Air Force One on Monday."

City mayor Sergey Sobyanin has ordered the facility even though Russia currently has among the fewest victims among major countries. He said the hospital will be constructed at least 800 ft from the nearest residential building some 40 miles southwest of the Kremlin. 'I guarantee that it will not pose any threat to the local population,' he said, announcing that rapid construction has begun. 'I am asking you to understand my decision.' The mayor, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, acted even though the total number of coronavirus infections in Russia now stands at 34, including those now clear of the condition. Of these some 23 have been recorded in Moscow city and the surrounding region. Officially there have been no deaths from coronavirus in Russia. 'The hospital will be built within a short time using pre-fabricated structures but still kitted out with advanced medical equipment,' said Sobyanin, a 61-year-old grandfather. It is unclear from official statements how many patients the infectious diseases hospital will hold, or when it will be ready to open. 'An outer fencing and security zone will be created around the hospital building,' he said. 'Sewage runoffs will be channelled to autonomous treatment facilities equipped with decontamination systems.' He said: 'An area in New Moscow (suburb), located outside the 'concrete ring', has been chosen as the site for the hospital's construction. 'There are no major residential areas in that district. 'Individual houses are situated 250 metres from the future hospital. 'This distance is two-and-a-half times larger than the recommended sanitary zone.' Sobyanin insisted that existing hospitals were coping with infectious diseases including coronavirus. But he said: 'Every new case requires the hospitalisation of the patient, as well as a few more people. 'Everyone who has had contact with the carrier is hospitalised in case they show even the slightest signs of acute respiratory infection. 'There are lots of other 'preventive' cases of hospitalisation, which do not lead to confirmation of coronavirus. 'Naturally, the city should be prepared for any turn of events.' The new hospital is to 'bolster our preparedness', he said. Currently two hospitals are at the centre of the Russian capital's war against coronavirus - Kommunarka Hospital and the Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital Number One. 'We have started building a new hospital for infectious diseases, and we will keep working on it,' said the mayor. The site is at Voronovskoye, close to the village of Golokhvastovo. The project was confirmed by the Moscow Urban Development Policy and Construction Authority. It comes just months after the Chinese government ordered construction workers to build a six-acre, 1,000-bed, coronavirus hospital from scratch in seven days. The emergency facility, named the Huoshenshan or Fire God Mountain Hospital, is situated in the suburbs of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak which has killed at least 26, infected around 920 and spread to nine other countries and regions. The authorities instructed four construction companies to toil through the Chinese New Year holiday to build the medical centre. Itreceived its first batch of patients after just 10 days of construction on February 4. Some 1,400 military medics were brought in from the People's Liberation Army to run the new hospital, which was made of revamped shipping containers and prefabricated buildings."
62,How to talk to children about coronavirus: Parenting experts reveal the home tactics and routines to set in place - and the things to NEVER say,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8107039/How-speak-children-coronavirus-home-tactics-things-NEVER-say.html,"As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the globe and new cases surface each day, parents are becoming more cautious around the ways in which they speak to their children about the infection. Australian parenting expert Sharon Witt has revealed her recommendations for parents, how to communicate with children about the issue and shield them from alarming news updates. She also urges parents to never speak about 'death' in relation to the virus, to encourage hand-washing routines and limit children's exposure to the news. Generalise and don't say the virus is fatal While there are serious side effects of coronavirus, Sharon said the best way to communicate these facts is to generalise. 'Never say you're going to die from this virus; never say it's deadly or fatal, because realistically any illness is deadly â€“ even chickenpox,' Sharon told FEMAIL, as worrying comments can place unnecessary stress on a child. 'All you really need to do is remind them not to worry and how we all need to wash our hands more often.' By describing the virus as a 'bad bug that can make you sick' is one general way to describe it to a young child. Use home cleansing tactics to practise hygiene Sharon said encouraging children to thoroughly wash their hands with warm, soapy water for up to two minutes is essential. 'This is a timely lesson for us to remind children about good hygiene practices and to wash your hands properly after going to the toilet and playing outside,' she said. 'You don't have to mention the virus, simply say ""there's nasty bugs out there and we need to wash our hands for one or two minutes every time so we don't get sick"".' One handy way to teach children this habit is to put a timer in the bathroom to use and place friendly reminders around the taps. Sharon also recommended children wash their hands with soapy water rather than using hand sanitisers. Limit what children are watching or listening to New South Wales: 92 Victoria: 27 Queensland: 31 South Australia: 11 Western Australia: 9 Tasmania: 4 Northern Territory: 1 Australian Capital Territory: 1 TOTAL CASES: 176 DEAD: 3 Viewing news headlines, hearing bulletins and reading reports can cause anxiety to rise among children and adults, but limiting this can reduce and control stress levels significantly. Restricting television programs while at home and choosing specific radio stations in the car are two important boundaries to set. 'With all these heightened news stories and headlines, it's a good idea to limit what children (particularly in primary school) are watching or listening to,' Sharon said. 'Younger kids may not be directly watching the television, but they're always listening, and there's a chance they could watch or hear something alarming.' If they do react to threatening information, communicate and generalise the situation to calm them down and ensure everything is okay. Talk it through with curious children and kids Those with curious kids who may have been exposed to news stories or heard about it in school, itâ€™s a good idea to remind them thereâ€™s â€˜nothing to worry aboutâ€™. For anxious teenagers who are prone to view frequent updates on social media, sit down and talk it through with them to discuss their worries on the topic further. Stay up to date with facts and keep sick children home It is the responsibility of the parents to stay informed with updated facts about coronavirus and keep children home if needed, even if they have a runny nose. As the symptoms between a common cold and the virus are vastly similar, it's vital to restrict the risk rather than sending children to school who possess symptoms. 'Dropping your kids off at school if they're sick, even if they have a runny nose, is quite a selfish thing to do,' Sharon said. 'If you send your kids to school when they're ill you are putting other children, teachers, parents and even grandparents at risk.' Stay informed of updates by reading school newsletters regularly and listening to the news yourself while the children aren't around."
63,"Most coronavirus infections might be spread by people BEFORE they even start showing symptoms, scientists sayÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107539/Most-coronavirus-infections-spread-people-start-showing-symptoms.html,"Most UK coronavirus infections could be spread unwittingly by people who have contracted the deadly illness but not yet shown symptoms. Scientists believe that up to three-quarters of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the Far East caught the bug from those who already had the virus. Obtained from studying communities across China, Singapore, and Tianjin, the results suggest incubators were not showing any symptoms of the illness. The unsettling discovery has disheartened infectious-disease researchers, following a day of disappointment in the UK following Boris Johnson's press briefing. At a No 10 press briefing yesterday, the Prime Minister called the coronavirus outbreak the 'worst public health crisis in a generation'. He also warned the 'most dangerous phase' was just weeks away. Mr Johnson said families would 'lose loved ones', while chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance claimed up to 10,000 people could already have the virus. Prof Steven Riley of Imperial College London, who was not involved, told The Guardian: 'This is one of the first things we were worried about when the outbreak began. This is one thing we really didn't want to go this way.' In China, between 65 percent and 87 percent of infections came from people incubating the virus. In Singapore, the range was 45 percent and 84 percent. Team researcherTapiwa Ganyani believes it is 'unlikely' that isolating sick people will slow the outbreak, calling for 'additional measures, such as social distancing'. The Prime Minister refused to prevent huge public gatherings including sports fixtures and concerts despite Scotland and Ireland imposing or advocating bans. He did concede, though, that his Government was 'considering' restricting large gatherings after he was accused of 'complacency' and 'playing roulette'. Yesterday, Mr Johnson chaired an emergency Cobra committee, where it was decided to shift the UK's tactics in fighting coronavirus from a policy of 'containment' to 'delaying' its inevitable spread. The Prime Minister said he was following 'scientific advice' which dictated that 'banning such events will have little effect on the spread'. School trips abroad should be stopped while people over 70 with serious medical conditions should not go on cruises. But schools will not be closed yet. Mr Johnson said the disease was 'particularly dangerous' for the elderly, as he called upon 'millions of people to help and support each other'. He claimed that most people would experience a 'mild-to-moderate illness'. Sir Patrick, who spoke after the Prime Minister, told the press briefing over 20 people in the UK with the virus were in intensive care units. 'Currently we are on a trajectory that looks as though it is about four weeks or so behind Italy,' he added. England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the NHS will alter its approach to testing for coronavirus, with only those at hospitals to be formally examined. People from now on would be tested 'irrespective of their travel history' if they showed severe symptoms, he added. The Medical Officer said:'We will pivot all the testing capacity to identify those in hospitals who have symptoms so we can pick them up early, make sure we treat them well and ensure they don't pass on the virus to other people in hospitals. 'So there will be a change in hospital and other testing systems.'"
64,Jersey City imposes 10pm curfew on bars and nightclubs while venues hosting more than 25 must use a sign-in sheet in battle to stop the spread of coronavirusÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108959/Coronavirus-Jersey-City-imposes-10pm-curfew-bars-nightclubs.html,"Jersey City has given bars and restaurants selling alcohol a 10pm curfew in a bid to slow down the spread of deadly coronavirus. Mayor of the New Jersey city Steve Fulop said this would quell large, uncontrolled crowds in venues such as nightclubs, as 1,700 cases and 41 deaths from the killer bug are confirmed in the US alone. The executive order - to be in place for at least one week - also instructs any venue that can fit more than 25 to use a sign in sheet to monitor who comes in and out. Speaking at a press conference Fulop said: 'Logically, one would discuss an uncontrolled environment like a nightclub where you have 1,000 people coming at night. 'So, if we can minimize interaction in that sort of environment where it is difficult to track people, we think it is prudent to take those steps now. 'We donâ€™t know who is coming in and coming out and we want to err on the side of caution. 'We are in uncharted territory, so we are going to be more aggressive than most [â€¦] we want to be proactive.' Events in the city - including theSt. Patrickâ€™s Day Parade - have been cancelled as the state confirmed six new cases of the bug that has infected more than 131,000 and killed 4,000 worldwide, NJ.com reports. New Jersey now has 29 cases. The measures enacted in New Jersey come as a state of emergency was declared in New York City anda lock down was placed on a suburb of Philadelphia. New York's roads and streets became increasingly more deserted yesterday as Broadway was shut down until April 12 and all large gatherings were suspended. The Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center, the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall all canceled events through March 31. Areas normally flooded with tourists stood silent as panic shopping gripped the city. The generally bustling Times Square was empty as increasing numbers of employees worked from home and others sheltered from the outbreak. Panicked New Yorkers rushed to stock up on essentials forming long lines and clearing shelves of produce."
65,Shocking moment Rite Aid pharmacy worker is repeatedly punched by a 'shoplifter' after shoving the raging suspect into a wall of products in Detroit,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108425/Rite-Aid-pharmacy-worker-punched-shoplifter-shoving-suspect-wall.html,"A brawl erupted in a pharmacy as a woman allegedly caught shop lifting savagely punched a sobbing employee who shoved her into a wall of products. The astonishing incident took place at a Rite Aid store in Detroit, Michigan, and was filmed by an onlooker earlier this month. It comes amid wide-spread stockpiling after the rapid spread of coronavirus across the country, as 1,700 cases and 41 deaths from the killer bug are confirmed in the US alone. In the clip, the employee shoves the woman, sending her flying into a wall of products and crashing to the floor. The employee storms away as the alleged shoplifter slowly gets to her feet and pursues her. The filmer follows the pair and says: 'Now you can't just keep putting your hands on her now.' The employee replies: 'She can't keep putting her f****** hands in my face.' As the camera rounds the corner into another aisle, the woman has the employee pinned to the floor and is punching her head. The filmer says: 'You should have just left her alone now.' The alleged shoplifter then climbs onto the woman's back and starts swinging punches at her head. Someone shouts 'oh my god' and another says 'cops are on the way'. The woman continues to punch the shoplifter - who she has trapped to the floor -before the woman lets out a desperate sob. The woman - who is now almost sat on the worker's shoulders - replies: 'Don't cry now because this is what the f*** you wanted.' The alleged shoplifter lets the employee go as the worker is escorted to the back by concerned onlookers. The woman adds: 'This is what the f*** you wanted, I gave you what the f*** you wanted.'"
66,Ja'Net Dubois' death certificate 'lists Blues Brothers star Cab Calloway as her secret biological father',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8108455/JaNet-Dubois-death-certificate-lists-jazz-icon-Cab-Calloway-secret-biological-father.html,"Ja'net Dubois' death certificate claims that her biological father was Blues Brothers star Cab Calloway, rather than Gordon Dubois. The singer passed awayunexpectedly in her sleep last month, and the document, which was obtained by TMZearlier this week, had Cab listed as the Good Times star's secret parent. It also said on the document, which was released by L.A. County, that she was known as 'Jeannette T. Calloway-DuBois', though this is disputed online. Ja'Net's fatheris listed as Gordon in her online biographies, while Lillian Goudey is named as her mother both in the document and on the internet. TMZ went on to claim that Ja'Net's daughter Rani said that Gordon was Lillian's husband and said he was 'instrumental' in raising the singer. Cab was theAmerican bandleader and singer forThe Cotton Club,a world famous jazz club in Harlem, where some of the biggest names in music performed. It was revealed earlier this month that the actress died of cardiac arrest, according to her death certificate obtained by the publication. To her family's surprise, the autopsy revealed she suffered from peripheral vascular disease and chronic kidney disease for years. Hypertension was also confirmed to be a contributing factor to her death. The mother-of-three was cremated and 'some of her ashes were scattered at sea' and the rest left with her family, according to the outlet. While it is largely reported her age was 74, Extra reviewed documents suggesting she was actually 87. Her silent and unknown health battle shocked fans, as the CBS soap star appeared healthy just weeks before her death at a meet and greet at the Marriott Burbank Airport Hotel back on February 1. DuBois is best known for starring in the hit 1970s sitcom Good Times, but she made history with her earlier role on the CBS soap opera Love of Life - becoming the first African-American actress to have a regular role on daytime TV. She starred as Loretta Allen on that drama between 1971 and 1972. The star's last film was 2016's She's Got A Plan; prior to that she appeared in the TV series short G.I. Joe: Renegades. DuBois was born in Brooklyn in 1945, and started her career on Broadway where sheappeared in a number of prominent plays throughout the 1950s and 60s, including A Raisin In The Sun and Golden Boy. DuBois soon moved to Hollywood and scored her first film role in 1966, and inA Man Called Adam she starred opposite Sammy Davis Jr. Critical acclaimed soon followed and she received a Peabody Award for her role in the 1969 CBS children's movie, J.T. In 1971, after scoring her history-making role on Love of Life, DuBois went on to secure spots on several other TV programs during that decade. Her small-screen credits from the 70s include Sanford and Son, Shaft, Kojak, Caribe and Roots: The Next Generation. However, it was her turn as neighbor and gossip maven Willona Woods in the sitcom Good Times that secured her stardom. The series was created by Norman Lear, and was known for being television's first African American two-parent family sitcom. It ran from 1974 to 1979. Afterward, DuBois continued to appear in a variety of films and TV shows. She won two Emmy Awards for her voice-over work on The PJs - a stop-motion comedy about the ups and downs of a black family living in a housing project. Meanwhile, DuBois also appeared opposite Demi Moore in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle in 2013. The star was also a talented composer and singer, who created the theme song for thr 1970s series, The Jeffersons. Janet Jackson, who played Ja'Net's daughterMillicent 'Penny' Woods in the hit series, shared an array of photos of themselves over the years, along with a moving message in memory of the late actress. 'I am so very saddened to hear my longtime friend Ja'Net DuBois has passed away. I saw first hand how she broke stereotypes and changed the landscape for Black women in entertainment,' the singer, 53, wrote on Instagram Wednesday. 'I'm grateful in recent years I had a chance to see her and create more lasting memories. I pray for comfort for all her family and friends. 'Thank you Ja'Net, I'll miss you.'"
67,Kicked out? US Soccer president QUITS after saying that women players have less physical ability and responsibility than men in gender discrimination filingÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107227/MLS-commissioner-USSF-VP-criticize-US-Soccers-legal-stance.html,"Carlos Cordeiro has resigned as US Soccer Federation president after the organization filed legal papers in a gender wage discrimination suit, claiming women players had less physical ability and responsibility than men, and therefore do not deserve to be paid equally. The US women's soccer team filed a wage discrimination lawsuit against the USSF last year prior to winning the 2019 World Cup in Lyon, France. The players are seeking $66 million in back pay. His decision elevated former American midfielder Cindy Parlow Cone to become the first woman president in the history of the federation. Cordeiro announced his resignation on Twitter, writing that the wording of the legal filing was 'inexcusable.' 'My one and only mission has always been to do what is best for our Federation, and it has become clear to me that what is best right now is a new direction,' Cordeiro wrote in his statement. 'The arguments and language contained in this week's legal filing caused great offense and pain, especially to our extraordinary Women's National Team players who deserve better. 'It was unacceptable and inexcusable.' Cordeiro stepped down on a day several USSF board members issued extraordinary rebukes that criticized the governing body's legal filings. Among them were Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber and Cone, who was serving as the federation's vice president before her promotion. A night earlier, the US women wore their warmup jerseys inside-out to hide the federation crest during the national anthem before a game against Brazil. Several of the federation's sponsors issued this week backing the players and condemning the USSF. 'It has become clear to me that what is best right now is a new direction,' Cordeiro wrote. 'I did not have the opportunity to fully review the filing in its entirety before it was submitted, and I take responsibility for not doing so. Had I done so, I would have objected to the language,' he wrote. In response to a wage discrimination lawsuit from the American women's soccer team seeking $66 million in back pay, the USSF argued in Monday's legal filing that the Equal Pay Act is not applicable in this case because male and female athletes are built differently. 'The point is that the job of [men's national team player] requires a higher level of skill based on speed and strength than does the job of [women's national team player],' read Monday's filing. Citing an academic paper titled 'Sex in Sport' by Duke Law professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman, the USSF pointed to 'indisputable science' in its claim that the women's and men's teams do not perform equal work. 'The male body is different from the female body in many respects, but the differences that matter for sport go to power, speed, and endurance,' read the citation from Coleman. 'They include skeletal structure, muscle composition, heart and lung capacity including VO2 max, red blood cell count, body fat, and the absolute ability to process carbohydrates.' Coleman has since told the Wall Street Journal that the USSF misrepresented her work, adding that a soccer team's job is to win - not necessarily run faster or get stronger. 'It's the same job the men are asked to do,' she said. 'When they do the same job, they deserve the same pay.' According to BuzzFeed, the USSF lawyer questioned US women's national team stars Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan over the physical differences between men's and women's athletes. 'Do you think that the team could be competitive against the senior men's national team?' the attorney asked Lloyd, according to documents filed last month. 'I'm not sure,' Lloyd said. 'Shall we fight it out to see who wins and then we get paid more?' Morgan was asked if it requires more skill to play men's soccer. 'No,' Morgan replied. 'It's a different skill.' The USSF filing also argues that the plaintiffs (the women's team members) have not established an equal pay violation. The Federation says it offered the women's national team equal pay to male counterparts for matches under USSF control but maintains the women want bonuses for tournaments such as the World Cup to match those of the men. By Alex Raskin, Sports News Editor for MailOnline.com The competing arguments in the US Soccer Federation's wage discrimination debate are clouded by a number of factors, including the differing pay structures between the men's and women's teams, as well as the fact that the men missed the last World Cup while the American women were, again, victorious in 2019. For instance, a US men's player in 2018 would be paid only slightly less than a women's player in 2019, despite the fact that the US men failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, while the US women breezed to victory in France last year. Here are a few things to consider: (Source: Associated Press) The women disputed the USSF account, saying the federation proposed to match rates the men had under their labor deal that expired in December 2018 and the USSF offer was for only for a portion of the women under contract. 'Since extending this offer, we have made multiple attempts to meet with the WNT to discuss these new options,' USSF President Carlos Cordeiro wrote Saturday night in a letter to federation friends and supporters. 'So far, they have repeatedly declined our invitation to meet on the premise that our proposal does not include U.S. Soccer agreeing to make up the difference in future prize money awarded by FIFA for the Men's and Women's World Cups.' Players on the U.S. women's national team are seeking more than $66 million in damages as part of their gender discrimination lawsuit against the USSF, which is scheduled for a trial starting May 5 at U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. Cordeiro's letter was released a day before the American women play Spain in a pre-Olympic prep event called the SheBelieves Cup. 'The USSF letter is riddled with falsehoods and issued on the eve of the SheBelieves game, which demonstrates that it is more important to USSF to diminish the womenÂ´s team than it is to support them on the field,' players spokeswoman Molly Levinson said in a statement. 'USSF did not and has never offered equal pay to the women players.' FIFA awarded $400 million in prize money for the 2018 men's World Cup, including $38 million to champion France, and $30 million for last year's Women's World Cup, including $4 million to the U.S. after the Americans won their second straight title. FIFA has increased the total to $440 million for the 2022 men's World Cup and FIFA President Gianni Infantino has proposed FIFA double the women's prize money to $60 million for 2023. FIFA pays bonuses to national federations, which each makes its own deal with its players. Cordeiro said the USSF also had responsibility to invest in youth national teams and other programs, such as player, coach and referee development. 'There is indeed a significant difference in World Cup prize money awarded by FIFA to the men's and women's championship teams,' Cordeiro wrote. 'However, it is not reasonable or fiscally sound for U.S. Soccer to make up the gap. It would seriously impair our ability to support our mission and invest in these other critical developmental areas.' The women have a labor contract covering 2017-21. The deal for the men expired at the end of 2018. Levison criticized the USSF for asking that talks be confidential, then issuing a statement with its view of talks. 'There is no compromising on equal pay,' she said. 'Equal is equal.' The USSF repeatedly has pointed out women's national team players have benefits the men do not, including guaranteed annual salaries, medical and dental insurance, child-care assistance, and pregnancy and parental leave. In February, the US men's national team urged the USSF to triple the pay of the American women and accused the governing body of creating a false narrative publicly in an effort to limit the wages of the reigning World Cup champions. 'The women's 2017-2021 deal is worse than the men's 2011-2018 deal,' the men's union said in a statement. 'The federation continues to discriminate against the women in their wages and working conditions. 'What we believe should happen is simple. Pay the women significantly more than our recently expired men's deal. In our estimation, the women were due at least triple what our expired deal was worth in player compensation.' The men claimed the federation wants their pay to stay at the same level as in their expired contract. 'It's a desperate attempt to cover up the fact that what they did to the women in 2017 is indefensible,' the statement said."
68,Washington D.C. sniper Lee Boyd who took part in spree that left 10 people dead had jailhouse wedding to wealthy 'trust fund baby' and activists who donated THOUSANDS of dollars to Bernie SandersÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109277/D-C-sniper-took-2002-crime-spree-marries-wealthy-activist-jailhouse-wedding.html,"One of the two Washington DC snipers who killed 10 people during a 2002 crime spree has tied the knot to a 'trust fund baby' in a jailhouse ceremony. Lee Boyd Malvo, 35, married wealthy Sable Noel Knapp, 30, inside Virginia's Red Onion State Prison on March 6, according to The Daily Beast. Knapp is the granddaughter of a wealthy Iowa real estate developer. She is also an outspoken activist who has donated hundred of thousands of dollars to left-wing causes. Malvo made international headlines 18 years ago, when he and John Allen Muhammad, 41, were arrested for the random shooting of ten people in and around the nation's capital. Malvo was just 17 years old at the time, and received eight life sentences for the crime spree. His attorneys claim the teen was 'brainwashed' into taking part in the sniping murders by his much-older accomplice, who was executed in jail in 2009. The incarcerated Malvo connected with heiress Knapp back in 2018, when she first wrote to him in prison. The pair started meeting a short time later. Meanwhile, Knapp also has a previous criminal conviction. She was arrested back in 2016 for blocking a roadway during a Black Lives Matter protest in Portland, Oregon. The lawyer who represented Knapp during that arrest told The Daily Beast that Knapp is 'really committed to social activism, for sure, and I think she was always looking for ways to make changes'. The wealthy activist has also put her money where her mouth is, donating$106,250 to left-wing Cathy Glasson when she was running for Governor of Iowa in 2017. Knapp has also having given 'thousands of dollars' to both Bernie Sanders and Marianne Williamson. In a post penned last September, Knapp wrote: 'Marianne Williamson is by far the most qualified presidential candidate to guide us in developing the insight and emotional resilience we need in America to build a truly beautiful future together'. Knapp has also co-authored a book titled You Are The Change: A Beginner's Guide to Socially Responsible Investing. She has additionally written multiple blog posts, with titles that include: 'Expand Personal Compassion To Break Cycle Of Violence Caused By Division' and 'Water is Our Shared Lifeblood'. Knapp's wealthy family have not made public comment on her wedding to serial killer Malvo. Her developer grandfather is still alive, but her father - who was a professional tennis player - passed away in 2008.  However, one of Knapp's mentors was present for the wedding ceremony. 'It was a wonderful occasion and I'm very happy for the couple,' they told The Daily Beast. 'They seem to be soul mates and they're very happy they found each other'.

Bernie Madoff was jailed for 150-years in 2009 after he squandered more than $17.5billion entrusted to him by investors. He has reportedly failed to show remorse for his crimes in the decades-long scheme, but now plans to make a 'dying' appeal by telephone to Judge Denny Chin, who sentenced him, for mercy. Madoff, 81, is currently confined to a wheelchair at the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina. He also requested early release last year, allegedly to care for his wife Ruth in her old age. Attorney Brandon Sample told judge Chin that Madoff should be allowed to contest claims by prosecutors that he has failed to show remorse. He told Judge Chin, who is now in the federal appeals court but presides over the case, that he would benefit from 'hearing directly from Mr Madoff about his acceptance of responsibility'. 'Allowing Mr Madoff to give what is, in effect, a final dying, personal plea is imminently reasonable,' he said. 'Mr Madoff's live, personal statement, could also help the Court in reaching its weighty decision whether to grant Mr Madoff compassionate release.' However, prosecutors have filed papers opposing this request. 'Madoff's crimes were extraordinarily evil,' they said. 'His sentence was appropriately long. It should not be reduced.' As many as 500 of his victims have also written in to call for his early release to be denied, saying 'one of history's worst fraudsters' should face the consequences of his crimes. One victim, an 84-year-old man, said in a letter handed in on March 4: 'Why should he be shown any compassion, when he had none for his many victims?' Only 20 victims said they would be happy for him to be released early. The federal Bureau of Prisons, which published the estimate of his remaining lifespan, has also refused to offer him early release as this would 'minimize the severity of his crimes'. Assistant US Attorney Drew Skinner said that any move to release Madoff would be 'self-serving and of limited, if any, evidentiary value'. He did not, however, give a view on whether the criminal should be released. Since his crimes were committed an estimated $14billion of the money lost has been recovered. Madoff confirmed on Wednesday last week that he is 'terminally ill'. 'There's no cure for my type of disease. So you know, I've served. I've served 11 years already, and, quite frankly, I've suffered through it,' Madoff said. His lawyer Brandon Sample says that despite the prosecution's claims, Madoff 'is remorseful for his conduct,' and 'remains hopeful' his request will be granted. Madoff also requested for his sentence to be reduced last year, claiming that he wanted to take care of his wife Ruth in her old age. Madoff's case is the biggest test of the First Step Act, a bipartisan law signed by President Donald Trump in December 2018 affording early freedom to some older prisoners, often for health reasons. Among those released is Bernard Ebbers, who once led phone company WorldCom Inc. He died on February 2 at age 78. Prosecutors said Madoff used his firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities to swindle thousands of individuals, charities, pension funds and hedge funds, including many with ties to the Jewish community. A court-appointed trustee estimated Madoff's customers lost $17.5billion. Nearly $14billion has been recovered. Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after admitting his fraud to his sons, who have since died, and pleaded guilty three months later to 11 criminal counts. They also said his request last year that President Trump commute his sentence was mainly so he could care for his wife Ruth in her old age, 'apparently confident' his health would allow it. Trump has not acted on that request."
70,Which generation do YOU fall into? Graphic illustrating the age groups for Baby Boomers to Gen Z sparks debate - and people in their late 30s are NOT happy to be labelled 'millennials',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8109077/Which-generation-fall-into.html,"A graphic dividing the generations into specific age groups has sparked a debate online. The illustration, shared on Twitter by British TV presenter Jeremy Vine, claimsBaby Boomerswere born between 1944-1964, Gen X between 1965-1979, Millennials between 1980-1994 and Gen Z between 1995-2015. The definitions frustrated social media users, particularly those in their late 30s who did not want to be labelled as millennials. One tweeted: 'I kinda resent being called a millennial (b. 1980), I feel much closer to GenX.' Another posted: 'But I was born in 1980 and im definitely NOT a Millenial!!!' A third wrote: 'Crushing if you were born in 84 let me tell you. I've never known 1984 babies called millennials before.' Another wannabe Gen Xer added: 'Always thought Millennials were 1982 onwards. I was born in 1980 and grew up as a Generation X...' There was also confusion at the other end of the Gen X age range, with some born in 1964 claiming they were too young to be a boomer. Others did not understand why 'boomer' might be used as an insult. Unhappy with being lumped in with a far older demographic, one Boomer posted: 'I don't have the bald hair or the tache!' Another added: 'December 1964 even. My heart bleeds ...' Adding salt in the wound was the realisation that those in Gen Z are not even in their mid-20s, with one Twitter user adding: 'Wow. That makes me feel old.'  "
71,First Philadelphia cop killed in the line of duty since 2016 after being shot just above his bulletproof vest by a murder suspectÂ Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109151/First-Philly-cop-killed-duty-2016-shot-just-bulletproof-vest.html,"A SWAT cop in Philadelphia was shot to death on Friday morning, making him the first officer killed in the line of duty since 2015.  Cpl. James Oâ€™Connor, 46, was shot just above his bullet proof vest while trying to arrest a murder suspect. The 23-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department was the third officer in 18 months to be shot while serving a warrant to a suspect. O'Connor spent 15 years as a member of the SWAT team. Credit: Katherine Scott/Twitter The married father of two was a member of a SWAT team that attempted to serve an early morning warrant to an apartment on the1600 block of Bridge Street in the Frankford section of Philadelphia. As the swat team entered the building, they were met by bullets that ripped through the closed door of the suspect's unit. â€œThese officers didnâ€™t get a chance,â€ Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said during a press conference. â€œGunfire erupted immediately as they walked in the door.â€ The swat team returned fire, injuring two people inside the apartment. But not before O'Connor was killed. Officers finally arrested several people in the apartment unit, including Hassan Elliot, a fugitive wanted for a 2019 robbery and killing that took place not far from the apartment complex. The homicide unit will continue to investigate the 2019 case, while the officer-involved shooting unit will take on the police shooting on Friday. O'Connor was rushed to nearby Temple University Hospital where a large group of officers converged after the shooting. As a 23-year veteran on the force, O'Connor was the first officer to be killed in the line of duty since March 5, 2015. That's when Robert Wilson III was shot to death after trading gun fire with two men in a video game store. O'Connor had a son who served on the Philadelphia Police Department as well as a daughter enlisted in the Air Force."
72,"Golden State Killer suspect, 74, looks gaunt and appears to nod off to sleep on his feet in court as a judge orders him to give up more DNA",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108163/Golden-State-killer-suspect-74-looks-gaunt-appears-nod-sleep-feet-court.html,"Golden State Killer suspect Joseph DeAngelo looked gaunt and seemed to nod off to sleep on his feet in court as he was ordered to give four cheek-swab samples. A Northern California judge approved prosecutors' request on Thursday to take more DNA samples from DeAngelo, who is charged with being the infamous 'Golden State Killer' who eluded arrest for decades. The 74-year-old former police officer is suspected of at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes across California in the 1970s and 1980s, and hundreds of home invasions. The statute of limitations has expired on those crimes, however, making them impossible to charge. DeAngelo entered the courtroom cage supported at the elbows by two deputies for the 50-minute hearing in Sacramento Superior Court. As usual, he never glanced at the crowd of spectators, looking instead in the general direction of the judge and nearly a dozen video and still cameras. He has usually stood ramrod straight during his hearings. However, on Thursday, he periodically slumped his gaunt head. DeAngelo was arrested in April 2018 on the basis of groundbreaking genetic genealogy evidence, but has so far indicated no willingness to accept a plea deal. Six counties have consolidated their cases in Sacramento County, and four of those counties are seeking the death penalty. Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Steve White allowed prosecutors, over defense objections, to take four more cheek-swab DNA samples from DeAngelo as they try to link him to old crimes. White gave prosecutors permission to swab the suspect's cheek for additional DNA evidence to be used in crimes in Ventura, Santa Barbara, Orange and Contra Costa counties. For the time being, he turned down a request that a fifth sample be taken to be given to prosecutors in Sacramento, where his trial on 13 murder and 13 rape-related charges is expected to be held. 'I am ordering that buccal swab samples be taken from the defendant,' White said. 'They will not be done forcibly. ... It won't be in open court,' Sacbee reported. Investigators surreptitiously collected DNA from DeAngelo more than two years ago that they say proves he is the rapist who broke into couples' suburban homes at night, binding one man and piling dishes on his back. Collecting more DNA 'is a minimally invasive procedure, unlike the crimes committed against so many of our victims,' said Cheryl Temple, a prosecutor from Ventura County who handled that portion of the hearing. Investigators pioneered a method of building a family tree from old crime scene DNA, using a popular online DNA database to find a distant relative and eventually zero in on DeAngelo. The new process has since been used nationwide in other cases.  White told prosecutors to informally decide who is empowered to consider defense attorneys' offer to have Joseph James DeAngelo plead guilty in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. So far, prosecutors have not wavered from their intent to seek DeAngelo's execution if he is convicted. 'Who's in charge? Who can make decisions? We want to settle the case,' said defense attorney Alice Michel, adding later that 'I don't know who I'm supposed to talk to.' Defense attorneys questioned in court filings whether Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert could alone negotiate a plea deal, of if she would have to have agreement from prosecutors in Santa Barbara, Orange and Ventura counties. He also faces lesser penalties from Tulare and Contra Costa counties. That 'is something that you probably should be entitled to know,' White said while urging the attorneys to work it out among themselves. Gov. Gavin Newsom has a moratorium on executions while he is governor. But DeAngelo's trial is likely several years away after what is projected to be a weeks-long preliminary hearing set to begin in May. His defense is currently being handled only by the Sacramento County Public Defender's Office, which says it is overwhelmed by the voluminous evidence in the case. It wants assistance from public defenders in the other counties. White said what he called 'an imbalance of resources' is 'not right, it's not appropriate,' though he had no immediate solution. 'It's legitimate to coordinate these cases into one county,' White said, though defense attorneys are separately arguing that they have not been properly consolidated. 'It's another thing, though, to say one office, the public defender of Sacramento County, takes the burden of the entire defense and all its cost.' The state last executed someone in 2006, and has a backlog of more than 700 killers on death row. A capital trial, which would follow a lengthy preliminary hearing in May, could cost taxpayers an estimated $20 million. Joseph James DeAngelo is currently being held without bail in the Sacramento County Main Jail. Claude Snelling September 11, 1975 Journalism professor Claude Snelling, 45, was asleep in his home in Visalia, California when he heard an odd noise outside at about 2am. He rushed outside to find a masked man dragging his 16-year-old daughter Elizabeth away. The abductor shot Snelling twice, killing him, and fled the scene on foot, leaving Elizabeth unharmed. The shooting was connected to the work of the Visalia Ransacker, believed to be responsible for 102 burglaries in the area, when ballistics matched the gun that killed Snelling to one that had been stolen in a previous break-in. Brian and Katie Maggiore February 2, 1978 Brian Maggiore, 21, and his wife Katie, 20, were walking their dog in their Rancho Cordova neighborhood, just outside Sacramento, on February 2, 1978. The FBI said the couple were chased down before being shot and killed by the Golden State Killer. Dr Robert Offerman and Alexandria Manning December 30, 1979 Dr Robert Offerman, 44, andAlexandria Manning, 35, were killed at a home in Goleta near Santa Barbara.

Domingo was found with her hands tied and suffering massive head injuries. Sanchez was shot andbludgeoned. Janelle Lisa Cruz May 4, 1986 Janelle Cruz, 18, wasbludgeoned to death in her family's home in Irvine. She was home alone at the time and police found her lying across her bed. A real estate agent who was selling the family's home was the first to discover the teen's body. Blood was found spattered throughout the home and police believe she was beaten with a pipe wrench."
73,Why you SHOULD let your kids play with their food: Nutritionist reveals the rules parents should ditch - from 'here comes the aeroplane' to forcing children to clear their plate,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8106151/Traditional-mealtime-rules-parents-ditch-according-nutritionist.html,"Mealtimes can be challenging at the best of times, especially if your child is prone to being a bit fussy about what's on their plate. While we all want our children to grow up as healthy eaters, sticking to rigid rules like forcing them to finish their vegetables isn't the most effective way to ensure that, according to one expert. Charlotte Stirling-Reed, an infant and toddler nutritionist, says imposing strict table etiquette on little ones often does little to aid their development. She believes mealtimes should be seen by parents as an opportunity to spend quality time with their children - something 86 per cent of mums and dads wish they could have more of, according to a survey by Scandinavian parenting brand Stokke. Here Charlotte shares with FEMAIL the traditional dinner table rules she'd rather were confined to the history books. 'Don't play with your food' The reason I'm not such a fan of this mealtime rule is simply because we know from research that familiarisation with food is one of the things that helps children to start to accept it. Playing with food - even without actually eating it - is all part of that learning process. It helps babies to explore the look and feel of foods which, in turn, boosts their knowledge and acceptance of it. So let them play - and try not to worry about the mess as much as you can! 'Finish your plate' Babies are actually pretty good at regulating their own appetite and knowing when they are hungry and full. If we as parents can set a nice structure up for them during the day, which includes milk, solids and naps, then babies are pretty good at learning their own cues around feeding time. Sometimes it takes a while, but it's all too easy to override their own innate signals and encourage them to eat more than they need. Try to practice feeding your baby 'responsively', which essentially means looking out for signs of fullness or hunger and responding appropriately. For example, if baby is clamping their mouth shut, crying or pushing the spoon away, it's time to stop the meal. But if baby opens their mouth for more, tries to eat your food or cries when you take the plate away, they might need a little more. 'Eat your greens' Quite often, the more pressure we put on youngsters to eat something up, the less likely they are to actually want to eat it. Sometimes just the act of sitting back, taking the pressure off and eating the said food yourself is all you need to do to get your little one to try something new - or finish their greens. Avoid letting mealtimes become a battle or a tug of war; try to fight your natural instincts and remain calm during times of food refusal. Charlotte says: 'Ideally dinner time should be an opportunity for communication and social interaction for children. 'Long gone are the days when children were meant to eat in silence. The more you can make your mealtimes about quality family time, the more your little ones will hopefully learn from you and enjoy the mealtime experience - which is important for also fostering a love for food. 'In fact, some research suggests that children who have enjoyable, talkative mealtimes actually have higher quality diets.' The best way to get your little one eating all these foods? Keep offering them up so that they become familiar with them - and eat them yourself! 'Here comes the aeroplane...' I'm a big advocate of making food and weaning fun! The way I see it is, the more enjoyable mealtimes are, the more your little one will associate food with enjoyment and fun - and that will rub off onto the foods they are eating too. However, there is a line, and it's not ideal to turn the action of eating itself into a game, or to use other distraction techniques to get baby to eat. This doesn't really help them learn about the importance of food or eating, and can actually make mealtimes and the action of eating become a bit of a problem. If your baby isn't taking to solids, remember to go at their own pace; role model as much as you can, and try to make mealtimes enjoyable family occasions. 'Children in one room, adults in another' Children and babies learn a lot about food and eating habits from watching, observing and role modelling from others. At the beginning of weaning, allowing baby to watch you eat can help them observe and learn skills around biting, chewing and swallowing, as well as learning what foods to taste and enjoy. One of my main tips when it comes to feeding infants is to try to get them involved in family meals as early as possible even before they start themselves - and get them involved in family mealtimes. If youâ€™re finding mealtimes a struggle, or if they are becoming negative, Charlotte suggests changing up the environment. 'Keep yourself calm, put on some relaxing music, change the position of the highchair around the table and maybe bring out a new tablecloth,' she says. 'This can help remove the negative association your little one may have built up about mealtimes and the dinner table. 'Staying calm yourself can make a big difference to how your little one experiences their meals. It's easier said than done, but sometimes you just need to get yourself in the right frame of mind in order for it to work for others too.' Bring them to the table when you eat; I see thousands of parents who have fussy eaters and I believe this can be avoided. I often recommend the Tripp Trapp high chair by Stokke, as it allows a baby or child to sit right up to the dinner table like a normal chair. Even if there are just two of you, social interaction and role modelling during mealtimes can make a big difference to food acceptance, so try eat together where possible, not separately. If you don't eat together often, try to make a big deal of it when you do. Distractions away, music on, kick off dinner with a game â€“ any way to make it a little special. Involve them in mealtimes with other friends and family early on. Showing them that food is a social and enjoyable part of life can really help encourage a love for food. 'Children should eat different meals to adults' This is really not necessary; families should be sharing the same family meals. After your little one has explored their first tastes of food â€“ whether that be finger food or meals blitzed in a blender -they can start having adapted versions of adult foods straight away. It is so important to combine meals and allow your babies and young children to see you eating similar dishes. This will help them to be involved in the mealtime, to learn what foods you eat as a family, and, usually, more readily accept them too. You may need to adapt textures to ensure that baby can manage the foods with ease, and you will also need to leave off any added salt or sugar, especially for young babies. But other than that, most adult foods are suitable for young children. Lasagnes, curries (not too spicy) and fish pie are all great options to have as a family - and baby can have a part of the meal or an adapted version of it â€“ whatever works for their age and stage of eating. Stokke is running a number of weaning workshops up and down the country with Charlotte, in locations including Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Brighton.

74,The end of the Meghan effect? Kate Middleton officially overtakes the Duchess of Sussex as the biggest royal fashion influencer of 2020 - with her Ireland wardrobe and love of causal wear proving a hit,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8105261/Kate-Middleton-officially-overtakes-Meghan-Markle-biggest-fashion-influencer-2020.html,"Kate Middleton has officially overtaken Meghan Markle as the biggest royal fashion influencer of this year. When the Duchess of Sussex, 38, first joined The Firm in 2017, the 'Meghan Effect' saw shoppers go wild for anything she wore; but since Megxit, her fashion influence has dramatically declined, according to data compiled by LovetheSales.com. Based on the popularity of her outfits from 2017 to 2019, Meghan's fashion choices lead to an average increase of 216 per cent in online demand. However, since the announcement that she and Prince Harry are stepping down as senior royals, Meghan's influence on online fashion searches has dropped to just 31 per cent. In stark contrast, Kate's 2020 looks so far have sparked a 159 per cent increase - a noticeable uplift from the 119 per cent average increase in searches for her outfits between 2017 and 2019. In January, both Kate, 38, and Meghan stepped out wearing coats bySpanish brand Massimo Dutti - and while both proved popular, Kate's was searched for online eight times more than Meghan's. The decline of 'The Meghan Effect' From 2017 to 2019, the 'Meghan Effect' had officially outshone the 'Kate Effect' - but since Harry and Meghan announced their move to North America, her outfits haven't performed as well as previous years.  The decrease in the effect is particularly noticeable when it comes to the Duchess of Sussex's signature gowns - notably the red dress by London-born designer Safiyaa on Saturday. The statement gown worn by Meghan to the Royal Albert Hall was very similar to a blue dress from the same designer which she wore in Fiji in 2018. The blue gown had a much bigger impact on shoppers, with searches going up for 'Safiyaa gowns' by 223 per cent in the days after the state dinner. By comparison, the red gown only sparked a 38 per cent uplift in searches for it over the last week. Kate's coat was more popular In January this year, Kate wore a camel Massimo Dutti coat to a charity event in Cardiff, Wales. On the same day, Meghan released pictures of a secret visit to her Mayhew's charity earlier in the month, wearing the exact same brand. But analysisbased on the combined Google search queries and page views of Brits revealed that in the weeks after both pictures of the duchesses were released, Kate's look was far more popular. In fact, the evidence showed that the Duchess of Cambridge's coat was searched for eight times more than Meghan's was. Kate's most influential look of 2020 The Duchess of Cambridge's most influential look of the year so far came on day three of her recent royal tour of the Republic of Ireland. Kate donned the country's national colours onday three in Galway, looking stylish in aAlexander McQueen trench coat and a Suzannah London vintage polka dot dress. The duchess teamed the look with a chic Jimmy Choo clutch bag and a pair of black Ralph Lauren suede boots. While the outfit was a huge hit, it was the recycled coat by McQueen - one of Kate's favourite brands - that sent shoppers into a fashion frenzy. Demand for Alexander McQueen shot up by 233 per cent online - and searches for trench coats have been up 93 per cent in the past week. Meghan's most influential outfit of the year The Duchess of Sussex's most popular look of the year so far came from one of her last engagements as a senior royal in the UK, where she delivered a powerful speech in honour of International Women's Day at a school in Dagenham, east London. Meghan wore a cream boucle jacket by ME and EM with black Alexander McQueen trousers, Jennifer Chamandi nude pumps and a Rejina Pyo weave bag. She made the surprise engagement at the Robert Clack Upper School in Dagenham on Friday and urged schoolboys to 'protect the women in your lives'. The cream jacket was a huge hit with shoppers, selling out within hours, and searches for 'boucle jackets' shot up by 92 per cent in the days after the event. Brits love Kate's casual wear  Kate is often pictured in glamorous brands like Jimmy Choo and Alexander McQueen, but it's been her affordable looks in 2020 that have caught the attention of shoppers. Out of 20 of her looks that have been analysed so far this year, 11 featured high street brands, with the likes of Mango, Zara and Reiss all benefiting from the duchess choosing their clothes. The most notable beneficiary was British high street stalwart Marks & Spencer; the Duchess of Cambridge wore their incredibly affordable white trainers to a SportsAid event in February. The vegan-friendly shoes, which cost just Â£29.50, were a massive hit with UK shoppers, sparking a 165 per cent increase in online demand. They were searched for over 2,000 times and sold out in hours on the Marks & Spencer website. M&S has said the popular trainers will make a return in April. "
75,Joe Biden storms ahead in new poll in Florida showing him with lead so big Bernie Sanders might get NO delegates from crucial state on Tuesday,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106791/Biden-storms-ahead-new-Florida-poll-showing-lead-big-Sanders-NO-delegates.html,"Joe Biden is likely to take Florida in their primary elections next week as polls released Thursday show him in a massive lead against rival Bernie Sanders. While Biden came out on top with 69 per cent support in a St. Pete Polls taken March 6-8, Sanders fell short with under 13 per cent. In the primaries, candidates need 15 per cent of the vote in each state, according to Democratic National Committee rules, to earn delegates for the nominating convention over the summer. According to this poll, which has a margin of error of 2 percentage points, Sanders may not even reach that threshold. After Super Tuesday at the start of March, the narrowing field was brought down to a near-two horse race between Sanders, 78, and Biden, 77. Florida, a swing-state with 219 delegates up for grabs, could be the momentum needed to launch Biden into the winner's spot as he's already more than 150 delegates ahead of Sanders. Another poll released Thursday from the University of North Florida also exhibits the former vice president's popularity in the state. Biden received 66 per cent of the vote in this poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 per cent. Sanders still came in a distant second â€“ but this time, with 22 per cent, reached the threshold needed to earn delegates. And even though this poll was taken after other lingering candidates had already dropped out, about 7 per cent was swallowed up by voters indicating they were voting for candidates who are no longer in the race, including billionaire Mike Bloomberg, Senator Amy Kobuchar, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Elizabeth Warren and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who only holds 2 delegates, has 1 per cent support in this poll. At one point, the number of candidates running in the Democratic primary neared 30."
76,What you NEED to know about hand sanitiser: Doctors reveal whether it's really safe to use your old bottles - and when you must get rid of themÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8107367/What-NEED-know-hand-sanitiser-Doctors-reveal-safe-use-year-old-products.html,"Doctors have revealed why you need to pay close attention to the details on your hand sanitiser bottle - and how using expired products could render them almost ineffective. According to Healthline, the average shelf life of hand sanitiser is somewhere between two and three years - so if you have a little bottle lurking at the bottom of your handbag and you can't read the font on it because it's rubbed off, the chances are it's time to toss it. 'The active ingredients are only guaranteed effective until the expiration date,'Dr. Andrew Alexis, MD, chair of Mount Sinai's department of dermatology, told Women's Health. 'There are no clear visual signs of expiration so checking the label is the only reliable way to tell if that bottle deserves to be tossed.' The alcohol in hand sanitiser disrupts the outer coating of many, but not all, germs; the CDC recommends using a hand sanitiser that contains at 60 per cent alcohol to ensure effectiveness. However, these products are not very effective against bacterial spores or against viruses that don't have an outer envelope. Sanitiser is effective against almost everything else. Washing your hands is better than hand sanitiser, but this is the next best thing. Source: LifeHacker Sales of hand sanitiser have soared in recent weeks, as people rush to get their hands on antibacterial products to prevent the rapid spread of coronavirus. The CEO and founder of Australian skincare range, Moogoo, told FEMAIL that their entire six-month stock of anti-bacterial hand gel has been snapped up in just four days. While doctors agree that 'something is better than nothing' and you can continue to use hand sanitiser once it's past its best, they highlighted that it's not always a good idea. This is because the active ingredient is alcohol, and once it has been exposed to air - even indirectly through the protective bottle - it will become less and less effective. Does hand-washing really work? Yes. A new study published by the highly-respected Cochrane Database which summarises and interprets numerous studies says that handwashing cuts the chances of contracting a respiratory illness such as coronavirus by 54 per cent â€“ the best odds of any deterrent. So wash your hands â€“ scrubbing every bit of skin from your wrist downwards â€“ at every opportunity for at least 20 seconds (or for however long it takes to sing Happy Birthday in your head twice). Should I use public transport? Only if necessary. If you can work from home rather than commuting, and also minimise shopping trips, you will greatly reduce your infection risk. One recent study in Nottingham found that people who contracted the flu virus in 2011 were nearly six times more likely than others to have travelled by public transport in the five days before developing symptoms. lanes, trains and buses are high-risk environments for easily transmitted viruses â€“ and Covid-19 is particularly infectious â€“ to spread on to our hands via surfaces such as handrails, seats and handles. If I stay at home will I be safe? No. Family and friends can easily bring in the virus. To reduce this threat, institute a handwashing rule for everyone as soon as they enter the house. And make sure there is one hand towel for each person. If thatâ€™s not practicable, wash towels frequently. When it comes to hand washing versus hand sanitiser, all of the experts agree that your go-to should always be washing your hands. 1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. 2. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. 3. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the 'Happy Birthday' song from beginning to end twice. 4. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. 5. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them. The CDC recommends that you scrub for at least 20 seconds (or for the time period that it takes you to sing Happy Birthday twice) and washing your hands is always better than hand sanitiser. This is becausehand sanitisers do not get rid of all types of germs, and they may not be as effective when your hands are dirty or greasy. 'They might not remove harmful chemicals from hands like pesticides and heavy metals,' the website reads. The agency recommends you wash your hands at frequent intervals to stay healthy, and advises that everyone follow five steps to ensure they are washing their hands the right way. 'The first step is to wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap,' the CDC said. 'Then, lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.' However the third step is where many people might be falling down. The CDC recommends you scrub your hands 'for at least 20 seconds' - which is the same amount of time it takes to hum Happy Birthday twice. 'Rinse your hands well under clean, running water,' the guide advises. Finally, you should use a clean towel to dry your hands or air dry them. Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food Before and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea Before and after treating a cut or wound After using the toilet After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste After handling pet food or pet treats After touching garbage Source: CDC"
77,Paramore star Hayley Williams reveals her weight dropped to just 91LBS. after her divorce from New Found Glory's Chad Gilbert - as she admits she used alcohol to cope with her depressionÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8109269/Paramores-Haley-Williams-weight-91-lbs-divorce-2017.html,"Paramore frontwomanHayley Williams was so depressed in the midst of her divorce fromNew Found Glory guitarist Chad Gilbert that she was barely eating â€” and her weight dropped down to just 91 lbs. The 31-year-old singer was with Chad for ten years, married for two, before they announce their split in the summer of 2017. Haley has spoken out about her depression during this period several times since, but in a new interview with The Guardian, she said that it was seeing photos of herself at her unhealthily low weight that made her realize their was no hiding her mental health struggles any longer. At just 5'1"", Haley's 91 lb. weight gave her a BMI of17.2, which is considered underweight. But it took seeing herself on film in two music videos for her 2017 album After Laughter for her to realize that she looked sick. 'It wasnâ€™t until I saw the pictures that I was like, thereâ€™s no hiding that Iâ€™m not OK now,' she said. 'And part of me enjoyed that â€” if people know Iâ€™m not OK, they wonâ€™t get too close.' Thankfully, her band mates got her to start eating again, but the healing process would take a while. Haley admitted that she turned to alcohol, drinking a lot after years of abstaining because her ex didn't drink. Haley also called the relationship 'unhealthy,' but said that she thought she could fix it. 'He probably looks at me like the villain,' she said. 'Throwing around my version of someone elseâ€™s story doesnâ€™t feel fair, which is funny because I donâ€™t necessarily think it should be fair. Especially not after the s*** I went through.' She admitted that she knew even before she got married in 2016 that it was a bad move, but she liked the idea of it. 'I wanted the whole thing â€“ the family â€“ and I thought I might even stop doing music for a while to do that,' she said. But, she pointed out, that she wouldn't have considered such a think if she felt supported. 'Give up the thing thatâ€™s the most precious to me? Are you kidding me?' Even on her wedding day, she wasn't quite at ease. She recalled being super critical of herself as she got ready, which wasn't how she usually behaved. 'Butwhen you have so much shame, you donâ€™t want one person to see a fleck of a problem because that could be the floodgate opening,' she said. Now she's been working on herself through music and therapy. 'One of my biggest healing moments was realizing that a lot of my depression was misplaced anger. I really forced it inward, on myself, and it made me feel shame all the time,' she said. Back in 2018, less than a year after announcing her divorce, Haley wrote an essay for Paper Mag in which she opened up about her depression. 'I didn't eat, I didn't sleep, I didn't laugh... for a long time,' she wrote. Later that year, she shared a series of tweets for World Suicide Prevention Day, writing that 'when my mind was super dark and hopeless, there was a part of me that felt safe being cynical & shut down. I'm trying to get healthier now... and itâ€™s a lifestyle shift. Sometimes it feels uncomfortable. 'And I donâ€™t always do it well... but I hope that if you struggle with darkness that you will try and remember to let yourself feel joy when it comes. I'm trying too. Sometimes I feel like I probably look less â€œcoolâ€ or I worry that Iâ€™m somehow faking it. 'But! I try hard to call out and recognize joy when I feel it, or even when i see it on my friends. Thankful for any chance to feel a genuine smile... not only on my face but deeper than that. 'If you feel darkness, I hope youâ€™ll wait for joy. It will come again and it is worth it.'"
78,Chelsea Manning IS ordered to be RELEASED from jail one day after her suicide attempt because 'her testimony is no longer needed'Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106843/Chelsea-Manning-ordered-released-jail-testimony-no-longer-needed.html,"Former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has been ordered to be released from prison, just one day after she attempted suicide in her Virginia jail cell. Manning was ordered by a judge to be released from jail Thursday, where she's been held for over a yearfor refusing to cooperate with a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. Her testimony is 'no longer needed, in light of which her detention no longer serves any coercive purpose,' court filings said. 'Accordingly, is hereby ordered that Chelsea Manning be, and she hereby is, immediately released from the custody of the Attorney General,' court papers said. Federal judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia said the grand jury investigating WikiLeaks is no longer active. In her time in jail Manning accrued more than $256,000 in fines for refusing to co-operate with the inquiry. A judge ordered that the fee must be paid in full even though her legal team asked for it to be vacated. 'It is further ordered that Chelsea Manningâ€™s motion be, and the same hereby is, denied with respect to Ms. Manningâ€™s request to vacate the conditional fines accrued against her to date.' She was held in custody at the Alexandria Detention Center for 11 months since May for refusing to testify in the WikiLeaks case. Hacker Jeremy Hammond, who was also being held in custody in civil contempt for refusing to testify before the WikiLeaks grand jury, was also ordered released on Thursday. He is still serving a ten-year prison sentence. Manning was previously scheduled to appear in court for a detention hearing on Friday, that was also cancelled on Thursday. On Wednesday the 31-year-old was found around 1pm in her jail cell where she attempted to hang herself with a bed sheet. Guards were able resuscitate her and brought her to a hospital where she is recovering. In 2010 Manning, then working as an Army intelligence analyst in Iraq, leaked more than 700,000 classified State and Defense Department documents to WikiLeaks that exposed possible war crimes and internal US communications about other countries. Manning, a transgender woman whom supporters call a whistleblower, spent seven years in military prison but was released by President Obama. But she told a judge last May she would rather starve to death than change her decision to testify about it in front of a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia. Manningâ€™s attorney, Moira Meltzer-Cohen, confirmed her suicide attempt in a statement to DailyMail.com. 'On Wednesday March 11 Chelsea Manning attempted to take her own life. She was taken to a hospital and is currently recovering,' she said. 'Ms. Manning is still scheduled to appear on Friday for a previously calendared hearing, at which Judge Anthony Trenga will rule on a motion to terminate the civil contempt sanctions stemming from her May, 2019 refusal to give testimony before a grand jury investigating the publication of her 2010 disclosures. 'In spite of those sanctions - which have so far included over a year of so-called ""coercive"" incarceration and nearly half a million dollars in threatened fines - she remains unwavering in her refusal to participate in a secret grand jury process that she sees as highly susceptible to abuse.' Meltzer-Cohen said Manning had previously indicated that she 'will not betray her principles, even at risk of grave harm to herself'. She added: 'Her actions today evidence the strength of her convictions, as well as the profound harm she continues to suffer as a result of her ""civil"" confinement - a coercive practice that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Nils Melzer, recently said violates international law.' In March of last year Manning was called to testify to a grand jury - a panel investigating major crimes that operates in secrecy - about her work with the siteâ€™s founder, Assange. When Manning refused and accused the government of abusing the grand jury process a judge found her in contempt of court and jailed her indefinitely. She was released two months later when the grand jury's mandate expired but and was called to testify before another one, asking many of the same questions. Manning refused a second time, telling Judge Anthony Trenga she would 'rather starve to death' that comply. He responded by jailing her again and hitting her with daily fines that have increased over time to $1,000 every day of her incarceration. In February Manningâ€™s lawyers lodged a motion calling for her to be set free, saying she would never change her mind. 'Her incarceration is not serving its only permissible purpose,' it said. In 2013 a military judge found Manning guilty of 20 counts, six under the espionage act but acquitted her of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, for leaking the confidential documents. Assange, 48, is currently in jail in the UK where he faces extradition proceedings after a grand jury in the US agreed he put lives at risk by leaking classified documents. He was arrested last April at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he had been seeking asylum since 2012. Assange faces 18 charges and a possible 175 prison sentence."
79,"Hitler's greatest enemy? Himself!Â The Fuhrer was a vain egotist who blamed others for his many strategic mistakes, and ultimately took the coward's way out: The only shot he fired in WW2 was into his own brainÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-8106425/Hitlers-greatest-enemy-Himself.html,"BOOK OF THE WEEK HITLER: DOWN FALL1939-45 by Volker Ullrich (Bodley Head Â£30, 848 pp) Do we really need another bioGerman historian Volker Ullrichgraphy of Hitler? Surely there is nothing more to be seen here. Time to move on? Sadly the answer is that, the world being what it is, we still need reminders of how fanaticism can descend into madness, racism into policies of extermination and whole nations into barbarism. The 75th anniversary of the Fuhrerâ€™s suicide in the ruins of Berlin is next month. This new account of his life by German historian Volker Ullrich could not be more timely, if for no other reason than its thought-provoking final paragraph, which is a wake-up call for us all. â€˜Hitler will remain a cautionary example for all time,â€™ he writes. â€˜If his life and career teach us anything, it is how quickly democracy can be prised from its hinges when political institutions fail and civilising forces in society are too weak to combat the lure of authoritarianism. â€˜How thin the mantle separating civilisation and barbarism actually is; and what human beings are capable of when the rule of law and ethical norms are suspended and some people are granted unlimited power over the lives of others.â€™ It takes 800 pages (including maps and copious notes) to reach this solemn conclusion, but donâ€™t be put off, because the reader who plunges in is rewarded with insight, understanding, fine judgements and read-me narrative drive. This is the second part of Ullrichâ€™s mammoth biography of Hitler. The first, analysing who he was and the ruthless politics that led to his astonishing ascent to power, was published four years ago to much acclaim. Ullrichâ€™s concluding volume, tracking Hitler from the outbreak of war in 1939 to his Gotterdammerung crescendo in the Berlin bunker, is equally impressive, showing clearly how he over-reached himself and was brought down in the end by an ego that brooked no dissent in pursuit of his maniacal ambition to rule the world. In all matters, he was driven by hate for humanity as a whole and increasing paranoia at being let down. He once told his henchman Albert Speer that the only living things he had any affection for were Eva Braun, his dyed-blonde, coquettish but loyal-to-death mistress, and his German shepherd dog, Blondi. And even the dog got shouted at if it dared pad away from the jealous Fuhrerâ€™s side to sniff around other people. Eva, on the other hand, seems never to have been in his bad books, getting away with liberties that were unthinkable for others. When he started out on one of his interminable monologues at the Berghof, his mountain-top home in the Bavarian Alps, while the rest of the inner circle had to endure and feign interest, she would pointedly ask the time to make him stop. And for her he did. But to no one else would he ever yield ground. Not the generals, with whom he was constantly at loggerheads as â€” in his eyes â€” their lack of will and vision led to defeats on the battlefield. Hitler wished heâ€™d purged the lot of them and replaced them with political commissars â€” as Stalin did in the Soviet Union â€” who were unflinching in their dedication to the Nazi cause. Yet it was his picky, petulant interference in tactics â€” driven by his belief in his own military genius â€” that was responsible for mounting losses of territory and armies. The idea of a tactical withdrawal was anathema to him, even when the generals (and common sense) told him it was the only sensible action to take. Never give ground, he insisted. Fight to the bitter end and die gloriously in a ditch â€” that was his injunction to the forces who gave their lives for him, though he himself eventually took the cowardâ€™s way out. The only shot he himself fired during the war was into his own brain. And it was Hitler alone who made the fatal error that would bring about his defeat â€” the decision in 1941 to launch Operation Barbarossa, Germanyâ€™s invasion of the Soviet Union. It was the moment the upward trajectory of the Third Reich turned downwards. Defiant Britain, Ullrich argues, played a crucial part in that event â€” that and Hitlerâ€™s own contempt for others. His armies had swept all before them, until brought to a halt at the English Channel in mid-1940. Invasion of this island â€” Operation Sea Lion â€” was thwarted by the RAF in the Battle of Britain. When the Luftwaffe failed to gain mastery of the skies, Hitler switched strategy. But not, as is often assumed, because he considered Britain was now an irrelevant tiddler and he had bigger fish to fry on the eastern front. Quite the opposite. His strategic reasoning was that he could easily and quickly dispose of the Russians and then come back at a later date to deal with the isolated and friendless Brits, whom he loathed for hindering his march to world domination. The miscalculation he made was the result of his obsessive racism â€” his conviction born of pure prejudice that the Soviet Union was a Bolshevik basket case populated by inferior Slavic races. They didnâ€™t have the backbone to put up a fight. His superior Germanic armies would wipe them out and take Moscow within a matter of weeks. Always the gambler, Hitler believed this time he was betting on a certainty, and to begin with it did look that way. As German tanks raced through the wide-open spaces of Russia, Stalin was slow to respond, refusing to believe that his one-time ally had turned on him. But then the Red Army dug in and turned the tide, encouraged by another of Hitlerâ€™s mistakes, the invadersâ€™ brutal treatment of the hundreds of thousands of Soviet prisoners they took. Faced with death as the only alternative if they lost, Stalinâ€™s soldiers fought for their existence on the blood-stained banks of the Volga â€” whipped on by those fanatical political commissars Hitler so envied. And they won. The five-month defence of Stalingrad resulted in more than a million Soviet casualties, but it crushed Hitlerâ€™s momentum, then threw him back somewhere he had never been before â€” on his heels. Volker Ullrich believes that, with this monumental setback, Hitler knew as early as 1942 that the war heâ€™d started was unwinnable and his dream of conquering the world finished. But he would never negotiate a truce. It was total victory or total demise. â€˜When everyone else loses their nerve, it is I alone who stands his ground,â€™ he bragged. Over the next three years, millions more on both sides would die in battle, sacrificed to his vanity. Nor would there be any let-up in his genocidal crusade to exterminate every Jew, the cause, his warped ideology told him, of all the worldâ€™s ills. The Holocaust could not have happened without his hate-laced approval. But nor could it have happened without the vast cohort of men and women who executed his will in concentration camps. Once Hitler was dead, the German nation pretended it had not known about the wholesale slaughter. Ullrich, himself a German, is rightly having none of that. Yes, much of the blame could be laid at the door of the Eichmanns and the Heydrichs who followed the wishes of their leader and masterminded the mechanics of the operation. But never could the buck stop there. The army and the police were complicit; so too were bureaucrats who drew up lists, railway employees who dispatched the trains and the firms that supplied the Zyklon-B poison gas and built the crematoria. Ullrichâ€™s accusatory finger points at every single individual who mouthed their allegiance to Hitler, dismissed the widespread rumours of massacres and simply shrugged as they moved into a deported Jewish neighbourâ€™s house and dressed themselves in the re-sold clothes stripped from the victims on their way to the gas chamber. Thatâ€™s why a new biography of Hitler makes essential reading, especially one as deeply researched, beautifully written and finely judged as this one."

The pair was on their way to take a CT scan when the doctor, Liu Kai, asked the 87-year-old patient if he would like to stop for a moment to watch the sunset. Another medical assistant took the picture as they were enjoying the moment. A glimpse of sunshine was particularly precious for the busy coronavirus medic and the elderly resident who had reportedly been hospitalised for nearly a month. The hospital said today that the patient's condition has been significantly improving and he is now able to leave his bed. The heart-warming picture has gone viral on Chinese social media after it was shared on March 5. 'What a spectacular scene,' one comment read. 'So amazing. Hope you can enjoy more beautiful sunsets like this.' Another web user said: 'I can't explain with words how this picture makes me feel. It makes me feel so warm.' The 27-year-old medic, originally from a hospital in Shanghai, has been working at the People's Hospital of Wuhan University since the coronavirus outbreak began. The elderly patient, who is a violinist, told the medical workers that he would like to perform a song for them when he recovers. The novel coronavirus, which is rapidly sweeping the world, has infected over 134,100 people and claimed at least 5,045 deaths globally. Elderly and people with underlying health conditions are considered at high risk of getting infected with the deadly disease. A 103-year-old grandmother recovered on Tuesday from the coronavirus following six-day treatment in Wuhan. The centenarian, Zhang Guangfen, was discharged from the hospital on March 10. She is so far the oldest coronavirus patient to recover in China and two years older than the previous recorder-holder, 101. Ms Zhang was cured within less than a week because 'she did not have many underlying health conditions', her doctor Zeng Yulan told the local press. China has been encouraging its citizens to resume to normal after the country has seen a steady decline in its new cases. The news comes as China sees only 8 new cases today, the lowest since the outbreak first started in January. Elsewhere,Coronaviruspanic has tightened its grip worldwide yesterday as scores of countries dramatically upped their response to the deadly pandemic."

All schools, community centers, gyms and entertainment centers as well as non-essential retail centers are to close for two weeks on Friday in the suburban Philadelphia county. Mass gatherings are outlawed as the state battles against the spread of the deadly disease. Panicked residents rushed to stock up at local grocery stores on Thursday evening as the Governor declared that only critical infrastructure such as hospitals, pharmacies, medical care centers and more essential retail stores would remain open for the next two weeks. The number of coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania has spiked from two to 22 since last Friday, 13 of which are in Montgomery County. Scroll down for video Montgomery County has become the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Pennsylvania, prompting a drastic decision from Gov. Wolf to isolate the community for 14 days. 'These actions may seem severe,' Wolf said in a press conference on Thursday afternoon, 'but they are far less draconian than what we may have to do in the future if we don't act now. 'No mass gatherings should be held, including conferences and rallies. By closing these facilities, we can control the spread of this disease, that's the hope. And we can redirect our public safety and health officials to where they are needed the most,' he added. 'The goal is not to shut anybody down, the goal is to keep Pennsylvania safe and by taking action, decisive action to mitigate, we're moving beyond simply containing.' The move includes closing large spaces such as the King of Prussia Mall, Suburban Square and Ardmore train station. State employee who commute in and out of Montogomery County have been told to work from home. Montgomery County officials added that that there will be no permits allowed for any mass gatherings outside or in temporary structures as residents were urged to avoid wither indoor or outdoor public or private gatherings. There was no order to cancel any gatherings but no conferences or rallies are to be held. Schools to be closed include all education facilities from day care to colleges and universities. Included in the critical retail stores that will remain open are gas stations and grocery stores. Officials also asked that employers would offer paid sick time during the outbreak and allow employees to work from home. 'My advice to our business community is to work from home now or risk not being operational later, due to employees becoming exposed or ill,' said Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. All jury trials and jury duty in the county are canceled through March 27. On Thursday, four new cases of the virus were confirmed in Montgomery County bringing the total to 13 and 22 in the state. They included a 35-year-old man who lives in Skippack, a 58-year-old man and a 53-year-old woman who live together in Lower Merion and a 58 year old woman who lives in Conshohocken. Other confirmed cases include a doctor at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Lower Providence police officer. Residents in Montgomery County rushed to local store to stock up before the lock down began on Friday. Long lines and empty shelves were pictures on the eve of the 14-day containment zone."
82,Lockdowns NOW will help stop the coronavirus spread and cut the death rate in half: Graphs show preventative measures such as canceling flights and shutting schools will drastically reduce infections before it's too late,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106127/Graphs-immediate-lockdowns-drastically-slow-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"Shocking charts have revealed how locking down the US could drastically slow the spread of the killer coronavirus, potentially saving thousands of lives while bringing a stop to the pandemic much faster than is currently forecasted. The total number of cases in the US surpassed 1,480 on Thursday - a nearly 600 percent increase from a week ago. The death toll has risen from 15 to 39 in the same period. Tomas Pueyo, a Silicon Valley businessman, created a series of graphs using official data from China and the US and warned trends in the worst-hit countries suggest the killer infection is 'coming at exponential speed: gradually, and then suddenly'. Pueyo explained the graphs in a Medium post calling for officials to implement lockdowns in the US immediately and keep them in place until the number of cases recedes. 'Mitigation requires heavy social distancing. People need to stop hanging out to drop the transmission rate so that it eventually dies out,' he wrote. 'These measures require closing companies, shops, mass transit, schools, enforcing lockdownsâ€¦ The worse your situation, the worse the social distancing. The earlier you impose heavy measures, the less time you need to keep them, the easier it is to identify brewing cases, and the fewer people get infected.' Pueyo commended the mitigation measures that are already in place in the US but said that they were not enough to curb the rampant virus. Those measures include the cancellations of multiple events, including the entire NBA season, music festivals such as Coachella and Stagecoach, and political rallies for presidential candidates. Washington state, California and Oregon all announce bans on gatherings of over 250 people on Wednesday. In New York, a one-mile containment zone went into effect on Thursday in New Rochelle, a town which accounts for more than 120 of the state's 328 cases. President Donald Trump announced an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe to the US - but stopped short of school closures or restricting public gatherings. Pueyo also noted that the US needs to drastically increase the number of tests performed. One of his graphs shows that the US has performed just one test per one million people. Other countries experiencing similar crises have exponentially higher testing rates, including South Korea with 2,138 tests per million citizens, Italy with 386 and the UK with 199. In explaining the need for lockdowns, Puyeo pointed to data which shows that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus took hold. South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5 million people, was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 percent despite more than 7,800 cases. But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until this past Sunday, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths â€“ a death rate of 6.6 percent. South Korea was well-prepared for its outbreak, which has been one of the worst in the world, and put two large areas into lockdown â€“ Daegu and Cheongdo â€“ as soon as cases started to spiral after a 'super-spreader' triggered an outbreak in a church. As a result, the nation has one of the lowest death rates of any country with a severe outbreak. As well as South Korea, Chinese provinces outside of Hubei, set a good example of how lockdowns can reduce deaths. Combined they are expected to have a death rate of around 0.9 percent when their cases are resolved, according to Pueyo. Most of China was quickly thrown into complete lockdown after the virus exploded in Wuhan and areas outside of the ground zero Hubei province have considerably lower death rates, and far lower numbers of cases. Italy, however, did not begin a major lockdown until this week, when it already had more than 5,000 patients to deal with, and in January had even stopped testing people with symptoms. Because of this it has been brought to its knees by the worst outbreak outside of China â€“ more than 12,000 people have caught the virus and at least 827 have died, meaning it has the world's highest death rate (6.6 percent). Pueyo said his research had showed 'countries that are overwhelmed will have a fatality rate between ~3%-5%'. The true fatality rate, which will become clear when China's outbreak ends, is believed to be around 2-3 percent. His research is based on official government case counts from around the world, statistics from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and information published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Cases outside of China, where the outbreak began in December, have risen 13-fold in a period of two weeks as dozens of countries rack up thousands of positive tests. Pueyo said countries should have taken more heed of what happened in China and how the country halted its own devastating outbreak, which appears to be starting to come to an end. 'South Korea, Italy and Iran had a full month to learn, but didn't, he wrote.'They started the same exponential growth [as] Hubei and passed every Chinese region before the end of February.' Other countries have arguably had even longer than those three nations, but many are not taking the drastic but necessary lockdown measures until it's too late, Pueyo argued. He also referenced the Spanish Flu pandemic in the US in 1918 to illustrate his point. During that outbreak, Philadelphia had a 'spiked' death rate of more than 250 per 100,000 people because it took two weeks to stop public gatherings, whereas St Louis brought them in straight away and kept its 'flattened' death rate below 60 per 100,000. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 4,500 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 125,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 â€“ possibly 9,700 â€“ were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 â€“ doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests â€“ caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
83,So that's where all the food has gone! Bulk buyers show off their packed fridges and huge grocery stockpiles as they prepare for coronavirus quarantine,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8107045/Men-women-impressive-stockpiles-coronavirus-sweeps-globe.html,"Bulk buyers have shown off their fully-stocked fridges, freezers and stockpiled pantries as they prepare forcoronavirusquarantine - despite world leaders urging shoppers to exercise restraint when it comes to stocking their homes with essentials. Social media users from Australia, the US and the UK shared snaps of their fridges, freezers, kitchen cupboards and attics stocked with essentials like toilet roll, nappies and non-perishable food items. One Australian homeowner started a thread onReddit, while others took to Facebook and Instagram to share their supplies using '#stockpile'. Many of those sharing are savvy shoppers and couponers who are used to buying in bulk and had substantial stores before the coronavirus panic started. Others shared images of their neatly organised pantries including peas, pasta sauces, pickles, Dorito's, as well as hundreds of cleaning products for use in the shower and around the house. When asked how she got started, one woman said she started to focus on buying discounted items five years ago after going through a period of time where she 'couldn't afford to feed the family'. 'There have been lots of learning curves. I only ever buy half price or less for items to stockpile. I wouldn't stockpile perishables unless you are positive you will use them,' she said. Most months she will only have to purchase additional meat, fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy for her family, because otherwise they rely on the stockpile. One homeowner said she has pureed enough fresh tomatoes to last their family for an entire year. 'The tomatoes were just skinned in hot water, pureed in a food processor, and then cooked down for a while to remove the air from pureeing them,' she wrote. 'Then, they were put in jars and processed using the Fowlers Vacola method to vacuum seal them. I'll use them for sauce and casserole bases during the year now.' When it comes to stockpiling, a professor has said it pays to be 'smart' rather than 'panic buy'. 'We can get in a bit of stock, foods, dried foods, dried fruits, some medicines - if you have any prescriptions it's good to get those filled now,' Professor Ian Mackay, an infectious disease specialist from the University of Queensland, told the ABC. 'Just ahead of time, in case there are any disruptions to shelf stock or shelf supply - things like truck drivers getting sick.' Meanwhile, the US Department of Homeland Security has advised US citizens to keep a two-week supply of food and water, a 30-day supply of prescription medication, and convert and store all family health records electronically. However, shoppers are being urged to exercise restraint as they prepare for a potential quarantine, with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio telling residents that there is 'no need' to stock up fridges and cabinets. 'Our supply chain is active and deliveries are rolling in as normal. Shelves will restock,' de Blasio wrote. The warnings appear to be falling on deaf ears however, with images showing shoppers in the city waiting in enormous lines in order to get into their local stores and stock up on food. Concerned shoppers revealed that some stores were limiting the number of people allowed inside because of the need for distancing between customers and so lines waiting outside were becoming more extreme. 'Apparently [grocery stores are] restricting occupancy due to coronavirus, so the line just to get to the door runs all the way down the block and onto the side street,' one Twitter user wrote. 1 Person: Pasta 2kg Pasta sauce 2 jars Rice 2kg Two minute noodles 2 pack Cheese slices 500g 1 pack Vegemite 1/2 jar Nutella 1/2 jar Peanut butter 1/2 jar Jam 1/2 jar Frozen fish 1 box Frozen vegetables 1 kg Pork, beef and mince meat Chicken 5 breasts Canned tuna 7 tins Eggs 1 dozen Tinned soup 7 tins Tinned vegetables 5 tins Long life milk 3 litres Powdered milk Frozen bread 2 loaves Sugar 1/2kg Cereal 1 box Soup 3 packs Salt and pepper 4 People: Pasta 8kg Pasta sauce 8 jars Rice 5kg Two minute noodles 6 pack Cheese slices 500g 4 pack Vegemite 1 jar Nutella 1 jar Peanut butter 1 jar Jam 1 jar Frozen fish 4 boxes Frozen vegetables 3kg Pork, beef and mince meat Chicken 15 breasts Canned tuna 14 tins Eggs 3 dozen Tinned soup 14 tins Tinned vegetables 15 tins Long life milk 12 litres Powdered milk Frozen bread 8 loaves Sugar 1kg Cereal 3 boxes Soup 12 packs Salt and pepper Source: St Vincent De Paul Society"

Naomi Watts finds dozens of rolls of toilet paper at her local bodega - as panic buying over coronavirus crisis sees supermarket shelves stripped bare,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8109533/Naomi-Watts-finds-toilet-paper-local-bodega-coronavirus-panic-buying.html,"Anxious shoppers have been emptying shelves of essential items around the world amid fears over the spread of coronavirus. One necessity that has run low is toilet paper - but Naomi Watts thinks she's cracked the secret to scoring those sought-after rolls. The 51-year-old actress came across dozens of packets of the good white stuff at her local bodega in New York. Naomi filmed a video of the full shelves at the corner store and excitedly posted it to Instagram, sharing her discovery with fans. 'Who needs a supermarket when you have a New York Bodega?? Mother Lode!' she wrote in her caption, adding the hashtag: #suckithoarders!!! Naomi also shared photos of her local supermarket shelves, which appeared completely empty. Among her Instagram posts, the Australian actress sent her love to Italy, posting a throwback photo in which she is reclining aboard a boat in Venice. Several Australian celebrities have complained about the lack of toilet paper Down Under as panic buying runs rampant. Last week, Sophie Monk, 40, stripped down and covered herself in 'loo paper' for an Instagram photo, taken by her boyfriend Joshua Gross. 'Holy s**t. I've bulk bought loo paper since I was a kid! Direct message me if you need some,' Sophie wrote in the post's caption,referring to the shortage. The singer and model also shared two videos of her local supermarket's empty shelves. 'Lucky we have some at home,' she said in one Instagram Story. She added: 'I always bulk buy [toilet roll emoji]. And tuna, thankfully.' "
85,Asian shares continue to fall amid coronavirus crisis but European markets bounce back while Wall St. braces after its worst day since 1987,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108133/Asian-shares-plunge-10-coronavirus-fears.html,"Asian shares plunged as much as 10 per cent today as the coronavirus crisis brought more turmoil to financial markets. Benchmarks in Japan, Thailand and India all dropped today in the wake of Wall Street's biggest plunge since the Black Monday crash of 1987. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell nearly 10 per cent in the morning session, and ended more than six per cent down despite a partial recovery. Another 10 per cent crash on India's Sensex briefly halted trading while Australian shares had a wild day and the Hang Seng dropped in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, European stock markets were rebounding from their worst day ever with the STOXX 600 index gaining 2.6 per cent. The FTSE 100 was also poised to gain 3.2 per cent following a recovery in oil prices and international moves to limit the economic hit from the coronavirus. Paris had suffered its worst one-day loss ever on Thursday while and London and Frankfurt also had their blackest days since the 1980s with losses of around 10-12 per cent. The Nikkei was 16 per cent down over a tumultuous week in which Donald Trump's decision to ban travel from 26 European countries has added to economic fears. Trump's comments suggesting delaying the Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus have also weighed on Japan's markets, analysts said. Losses were equally staggering outside Japan, driving MSCI's broad Asia-Pacific index back to where it was in 2017. Gold and oil fell and once-safe sovereign bonds slumped as investors liquidated everything they could to cover losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell five per cent at one stage, but ended only one per cent down. China's Shanghai composite dropped three per cent. In Bangkok, the Thailand SET gained 0.5 per cent after a temporary suspension of trading earlier in the day. Asian currencies also suffered as virus fears drove demand for the US dollar, the world's reserve currency. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 had its wildest trading day on record, falling past eight per cent before surging in the last minutes of trade to settle 4.4 per cent higher. State leaders in Australia agreed to increase spending to counter the impact of the viral outbreak. 'The governor of the Reserve Bank made it very clear this morning the levers of fiscal policy need to do their job here,' Prime minister Scott Morrison said. 'We need to put budgets to work to keep people in work,' said Morrison, whose federal government has already pledged 11.4 billion (Â£5.7 billion) in stimulus. The market plunge has gathered pace after Trump imposed his travel ban and the European Central Bank disappointed markets by holding back on rate cuts. Travel stocks have been the worst hit, with Carnival Corp tumbling 7.9 per cent to its lowest level since 2009 after its subsidiary Princess Cruises said it would suspend the voyages of all its 18 ships for two months. 'Government bureaucracy simply has not kept pace with the nature of the outbreak and market expectations,' said Tai Hui an Asia market strategist at J.P. Morgan. 'We need to see the number of new infections stabilise...we also need to see fiscal and monetary policy support implementation,' he said. 'Hence, we are not looking at a specific time or valuation to advise investors to add back equities.' The sell-off on Wall Street helped to wipe out much of Wall Street's gains which Trump has touted as evidence of economic success since he became president. The S&P 500 plummeted 9.5 per cent, for a total drop of 26.7 per cent from its all-time high, set just last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,352 points, or 10 per cent, its heaviest loss since its nearly 23 per cent drop on October 19, 1987, known as Black Monday. Stocks fell so fast on Wall Street at Thursday's opening bell that they triggered an automatic, 15-minute trading halt for the second time this week. The so-called circuit breakers were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week hadn't been tripped since 1997. European markets fell 12% in one of their worst days ever, even after the European Central Bank pledged to buy more bonds and offer more help for the economy. 'Between the lack of a strong US fiscal response and the latest travel ban for arrivals from Europe to the US, global markets appear to have been tipped over into a sell-everything mode,' Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary."

'I talked to the President and the Vice President today about this, and they're taking this very serious,' White told ESPN's SportsCenter. 'They're saying be cautious, be careful, but live your life and stop panicking. Everybody is panicking and instead of panicking, we're actually getting out there and working with doctors and health officials and the government to figure out how we keep the sport safe and continue to put on events.' The UFC has a fight scheduled for Saturday night in Brazil, where fans will be prohibited from attending. Meanwhile the NBA, MLS, MLB, and NHL have postponed play while the NCAA has cancelled the men's and women's Division I basketball tournaments. The PGA tour has cancelled the Players Championship as well as several other events, and the Masters has been postponed indefinitely. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 'Yesterday the governor of Brazil issued a decree limiting the size of public events so we will do our event live from Brasilia on Saturday, and we're going ahead with it,' White said. 'We can't have over 100 people there, so we'll just have staff that's running the event inside the arena that night.' Other bouts might be relocated to the UFC's facility in Las Vegas, where they, too, will be held without fans. A March 21 event scheduled for London will proceed as planned, White said. 'We're working closely with the government if there are any changes over there, but as of right now that event is moving forward,' said White. The UFC has not announced any changes to its broadcast schedule, and White insists all the events can still be seen on ESPN as well as other web streaming services. White did caution that the situation is fluid, so further changes may be necessary. 'Think about our sport, we always go overboard with health and safety and that's what we're gonna do here,' said White, who recently spoke at a Trump campaign rally in Colorado.' White has previously defended his relationship with Trump, who has consistently downplayed the dangers of the coronavirus. 'This guy, and when I say this guy I'm talking about President Trump, is such a good friend and such a loyal, amazing guy, man,' White once told TMZ. 'He's a great guy. He's been a friend of mine for a long time.'"
87,"Switzerland, Luxembourg and Germany become the latest European countries to close their schoolsÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108427/Luxembourg-latest-European-country-close-schools.html,"Switzerland, Luxembourg and Germany have become the latest European countries to close their schools in a desperate bid to halt the spread of coronavirus. The alpine country has added to its containment measures a $10billion aid package for hard-hit businesses as new test results brought its total number of cases to more than 1,000. Luxembourg has said it will limit visits to the elderly, after the country reported 26 cases of COVID-19. And at least 12 of Germany's 16 states have told pupils not to come back to the classroom until April 6, as the country announced a total of more than 2,300 cases. Declaring the closure of schools today, Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga said: 'The situation is difficult'. Some regional authorities had already closed their educational institutions. Ticino, which borders Italy and has seen three deaths due to the virus, took the drastic measure on Friday. Childcare facilities are to be set up for students who can't remain at home, reports The Local. The closures are expected to last until April in the country of more than eight million people. Luxembourg's prime minister Xavier Bettel said yesterday: 'Daily life is going to change and we will have to adapt' as he announced measures never before seen in the Grand Duchy. There have been no deaths in the country but a 94-year-old man is reportedly critically ill in hospital. The landlocked kingdom is home to only 600,000 people, but it accepts more than 200,000 commuters from neighbouring Belgium, France and Germany every day. Saarland became the first German state to close its schools late on Thursday followed by Bavaria. Bremen, North-Rhine Westphalia, Hamburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia will close their schools on Monday. Berlin and Baden-Wurttemberg has said that all schools will shut on Tuesday. Brandenburg will close its classrooms on Wednesday. Hesse has said it will shut its schools on Monday, but will allow exams scheduled for March 16 to go ahead as planned. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has said it has no plans to close schools while Lower Saxony has made attending 'not compulsory', but kept schools open.Saxony is also yet to make a decision. The decision comes just one day after UK Prime MinisterBoris Johnson insisted that British schools were staying open, and that closureswould do nothing to prevent the escalating coronavirus crisis. As in many other countries touched by the virus, Luxembourg wants to encourage people to work from home, but this is complicated in its case by the tax rules for cross-border workers. At least seven more European countries have announced closures, including France, Belgium, Ireland, Austria, Norway and Portugal. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced pressure to act after Ireland announced that its schools, colleges and childcare facilities would be closed for the rest of the month from today. Despite facing more than eight times fewer cases than Britain, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the country needed to undertake â€˜big changes in the way we live our livesâ€™ to defeat the virus. The Prime Minister said sending Englandâ€™s nine million pupils home could do â€˜more harm than goodâ€™ â€“ but ordered schools to cancel all trips abroad. An official petition on the UKâ€™s parliamentary website calling for the Government to consider closing schools had gained almost 375,000 signatures last night."
88,North Korea deploys Photoshop to beat coronavirus: Masks are superimposed onto propaganda images - while Kim is pictured without one to show he does not fear the diseaseÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108679/North-Korea-deploys-Photoshop-beat-coronavirus.html,"North Korea has Photoshopped face masks onto coronavirus propaganda images, an expert has claimed. Multiple photographs depicting North Korea's response to the threat of COVID-19 were sent to Stuart Gibson,a senior lecturer in forensic science at the University of Kent, for expert analysis. But while North Korea has gone to great lengths to show the world there is no shortage of medical equipment within the hermit state, images of Kim Jong Un show the dictator with no mask on - to bolster his image as a fearless leader. Dr Gibson, who has 24 years experience in image processing and has written software to sniff out fake pictures, said he thought all seven images were 'probably forgeries'. In one forged image, two woman are seen working at a factory loom, while a colleague stands at a machine in the background. Dr Gibson said: 'I'm looking at the face masks and the resolution of them is certainly lower than the resolution of the rest of the image, and that says to me that they have been copied and pasted in. 'Particularly if you look at the lady on the right hand side: the top edge of that face mask is very pixelated. 'They've made some attempt to smooth it in, but you can still see the pixelation there.' He continued: 'The best bit is that the figure in the background hasn't got any legs. 'If they'd just taken the legs down a few more pixels they might have gotten away with it but you can clearly see that there's a gap there â€“ that figure has been superimposed.' Another photo shows a woman in a white apron working at a machine â€“ but there's something jarring about the picture. 'Here you've got the added difficulty that the face is three-dimensional and the mask is wrapped around it, and in some of the forgeries it doesn't really follow the shape of the face exactly.' Dr Gibson said: 'With a lot of these images, there's not a single light source which makes it quite difficult by eye to put a finger on exactly why the lighting is wrong. 'But the mind is very good at detecting that something is not quite right. 'That picture is almost certainly a fake. I think that's probably due to the fact that the lighting is inconsistent with the rest of the image. 'This photograph has been taken with a lot of natural light and maybe the mask has been superimposed from an image that was photographed in different lighting conditions.' While the regime pumps out the Photoshopped images, the Supreme Leader, and Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, still refuses to be pictured in one. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus in China's central city of Wuhan in December, the North Korean dictator has been photographed numerous times, often with his underlings sporting the protective face masks. The images show Chairman Kim in stark contrast to his officials, setting him apart from the general soldiery with their black face protectors. Kim Jong Un and the ruling Kim family are the pinnacle of North Korea's cult of personality, which has been around for decades in the secretive country. Followers of the cult have a fanaticism about Kim Jong Un that is so strong, many see the leader as a god with divine power, which is often played upon by the ruler's propaganda machine. The images of him without protection shows him as a strongman, immune to the deadly consequences of the disease. The dictatorship is guided by an ideology of self-reliance called Juche, and recent propaganda has boasted that North Korean factories are producing tens of thousands of masks a day. At a time when neighbouring South Korea is running short on face masks, the north may be hoping to emphasise the success of its self-reliance, despite having an inadequate supply itself. It's also possible that Pyongyang is trying to make propaganda that was created before the crisis reflect the latest guidance, which bans everyone without a mask from entering public places. The regime continues to deny that COVID-19 has any presence within its borders, however unconfirmed reports leaked to the foreign press tell a different story. A source in the North's military told South Korea's Daily NK newspaper that 180 soldiers had already succumbed to the virus, with most deaths happening near to the closed border with China. A further 3,700 soldiers were under quarantine, they added. Meanwhile, a Seoul government official told the Chosun Ilbo newspaper that Kim Jong-un had fled Pyongyang to escape the virus, heading for Wonsan, a coastal resort town. The faked photos were discovered after a rumour circulated in neighbouring South Korea that its government had donated face masks to the North, even as its own supply dwindled. The rumour was forcefully denied by the government in Seoul. "
89,Charles Barkley reveals he has put himself into 'self-quarantine' while awaiting results of his Coronavirus test,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8107569/Charles-Barkley-reveals-self-quarantine.html,"Charles Barkley revealed that he has put himself into self-quarantine while awaiting the results of his Coronavirus test. The 57-year-old NBA legend called into the NBA on TNT broadcast on Thursday, where he revealed he is in a self-imposed 48-hour quarantine. The news comes just a day after the NBA suspended its regular season after one player, Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert, tested positive for the virus, and just hours after one of his teammates, Donovan Mitchell, also tested positive as well. Over the phone, Barkley stated, 'I spent the earlier part of the week in New York City. When I got to Atlanta, I wasnâ€™t feeling well.' 'I talked to a couple people at Turner and a couple doctors and they told me to self-quarantine for the next 48 hours,' he added. 'I started yesterday. This is my second day. I havenâ€™t been feeling great and they didnâ€™t want me to take any chances. I went and took the Coronavirus test late this afternoon and I have not got the results back,' he added. â€œIâ€™m just kinda in limbo right now. Iâ€™m really hoping it was just a bug,' he added. Dr. Sanjay Gupta,CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, later joined the NBA on TNT broadcast, where Barkley asked over the phone if the Coronavirus epidemic, 'will get worse before it gets better.' 'It is a fair question, and the answer is yes. I wanna give you an honest answer, Charles,' Gupta began. He added that 'some of the largest quarantines in human history happened over the last three months,' with over 60 million people in quarantine. He also said that he expects a 'sudden increase in numbers' over the next few days and weeks, which is a reflection of, 'the testing finally catching up in this country.' 'A lot of people are going to find out that they in fact have this, and they'll be surprised that they have it,' Gupta added. 'The fact is the virus is circulating in these communities and people are getting infected, they just don't know it yet,' he concluded. Barkley was born in Leeds, Alabama and played his college ball at Auburn before being drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers. He played for 16 seasons and was an 11-time NBA All-Star and he was named NBA MVP in 1993. "

It comes after actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for the novel coronavirus, they revealed on Wednesday night. The Forrest Gump actor and his wife, both 63, announced the positive test results on Instagram urging the public to 'take care'. The couple are currently in Gold Coast, Australia where the Oscar winner is filming an untitled Baz Luhrmann-directed Elvis Presley film produced by Warner Bros. Hanks revealed he and his wife experienced symptoms including the common cold, body aches and chills before they decided to get tested. President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he was ordering an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe to the United States from midnight on Friday to try to stop the spread of coronavirus in the US. 'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, conceding that world health officials had now declared the health crisis a pandemic after insisting for days that it would 'go away' and urging Americans not to panic. The ban will apply to travellers who have visited 26 countries in the EU's Schengen border-free area in the last 14 days, but not travellers from the UK or Ireland, or to US citizens, American permanent residents and their immediate family members. Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday morning that all Americans returning from Europe would be asked to quarantine when they return. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready."

All XFL ticket holders will be issued refunds or credit toward future games. The XFL is committed to playing a full season in 2021 and future years.' The XFL's decision follows similar moves by the NBA, MLS, Major League Baseball and the NCAA, which cancelled the Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments at a tremendous financial loss. Officially, the XFL averaged 18,614 fans per game with another 2 million viewers watching on that network and its parent company, ABC. Although viewership declined over the season's four weeks, the XFL enjoyed some ratings success. All 10 of the games broadcast on ABC ranked among television's top 10 shows in their respective weeks, according to ESPN. The majority owner and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon's previous effort to launch the XFL failed in 2000. Unlike McMahon's previous effort, this incarnation of the XFL did not use the billionaire as the face of the league. Rather, former NFL quarterback Oliver Luck served as commissioner of the eight-team league, which was scheduled for a 10-week season."
94,Incredible moment quarantined Italians chant 'don't give up' together from their balconies and sing rousing soccer songs to lift their spirits amid coronavirus crisis in Naples,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108199/Coronavirus-Incredible-moment-quarantined-Italians-chant-dont-together.html,"This is the incredible moment quarantined Italians chant 'don't give up' together from their balconies and sing rousing football songs to lift spirits amid the devastating coronavirus crisis in Naples. The residents of the housing blocks, which are in theCasoria commune in the southern city of Naples, joinedtogether last night, shouting from their balconies in a chorus of resistance against the deadly disease sweeping the country. In the video, the Neapolitan locals can be heard singing: 'We will stay at home. 'Tonight the whole of Casoria are united in chorus. 'The people will never give up so come on Naples!' The video, posted by Susy Unica Silvestri, has been shared just under 10,000 times since it was uploaded to her Facebook last night. The locked-down citizens then ring out verses of their local team,SocietÃ  Sportiva Calcio Napoli, who play in Serie A, the top tier of Italian football. 'People like us will never give up; people like us will never give up; people like us; people like us; people like us will never give up,' they chant in unison. 'Come on Italy! Come on Naples! 'Forever! 'We are all united. 'Come out on your balconies, out on your balconies! Come out on your balconies, out on your balconies! 'The virus that is facing us will not defeat us... The virus that is facing us will not defeat us!' Other cities have also joined together, singing similar renditions of local favourites, with Siena, which is in Tuscany, belting out a version of'Canto della Verbena' (And while Siena sleeps). Naples, in the south of the country, escaped the initial surge in coronavirus cases, recording just 95 infections as of yesterday, but citizens have still been placed under strict 'stay at home rules' by the Italian government. Italy's death toll topped 1,000 Thursday with more than 15,000 confirmed cases. The majority were in the north of the country. Under the restrictive measures, people can only leave home if they need to do so for work purposes, to buy groceries, for health reasons, and to provide care to youngsters and the elderly.     "
95,Colorado health officials close drive-through coronovirus testing lab after high volume leaves patients waiting three hours for ten minute procedure,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106487/Colorado-closes-drive-coronovirus-testing-lab-three-hour-wait-10-minute-procedure.html,"Health officials in Colorado put the breaks on one of the first drive-through coronavirus testing labs in the US on Thursday after a high volume of patients created a three hour wait for the ten minute procedure. The drive-through labat the Lowry State Health Department in Denver had to close only an hour after it opened at 11am, officials said. 'Due to an extremely high volume of people seeking COVID-19 tests at the drive-up testing site in Lowry, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is working to establish and communicate a cut-off point for the line,' officials wrote in a statement posted online. The facility, on only its second day of operation, was jammed with such a high volume of patients, it had created a three hour wait for the testing, which only takes about ten minutes. Patients who end up receiving positive test results may be issued isolation orders. 'Depending on test volume, we aim to contact individuals directly with their results within 72 hours, state officials said in a statement. A drive-through testing lab also was being operated in Indiana, as officials said they hoped the facilities will help contain the coronavirus pandemic, which has afflicted more than 1,400 people in the US and left 39 people dead. Officials in Denver said the drive through's wait time when it first opened on Wednesday had been about 84 minutes on average, allowing the treatment of 160 patients. Any motorist who was already on line Thursday was given a note to return on Friday with priority status, health officials said. Patients cannot just show up to the testing lab at the Lowry State Health Department, Colorado Governor Jared Polis said earlier this week, reminding the public that a doctor's note is required. 'In order to minimize wait times,anyone who is symptomatic or who believes they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should call or email your physician first for guidance, a doctor's order for testing, and information about private providers where you can get tested. Always call first before reporting to a healthcare facility for testing,' state officials said in guidelines for the testing. Health officials said the Denver lab will reopen tomorrow and again Monday. 'We may keep it open through the weekend depending on supplies and demand,' the said in a statement posted online."
96,US airports are DESERTED as travelers from Europe complain they're not being checked for coronavirus just hours before Donald Trump's travel ban begins,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107173/Chaos-airports-ahead-Trumps-travel-ban.html,"Chaos is unfolding in airports across the country where media members have been kicked out, travelers entering the US complain that they aren't screened upon landing, and disgruntled Americans pay up to $20,000 to get a last minute ticket home. On Wednesday Trump announced he will restrict travel to the US from several European countries in an attempt to containthe spread of the killer coronavirus. The ban will apply to travelers who have visited 26 countries in the EU's Schengen border-free area in the last 14 days, but not travelers from the UK or Ireland, or to US citizens, American permanent residents and their immediate family members. Although Trump's new measures won't take effect until Friday at midnight, travelers are still in a frenzy over the confusing new rules. International airports across the country have become eerie ghost towns with few travelers in light of the coronavirus panic. The case toll in the US hit over 1,500 and the death toll hit over 30 as of Thursday. One of DailyMail.com's photographers was kicked out of John F. Kennedy International Airport on Thursday amid the panic related to the travel ban. Some American travelers have complained about a lack of safety procedures and caution at airports across the country. Mike McIntire tweeted that even though he just returned from Paris, France - a country notably on Trump's travel ban list - he was not screened upon landing at JFK on Thursday. 'Just arrived at JFK from Paris. Zero screening, testing or even questions related to coronavirus (and the Global Entry scanner spit out someone else's entry receipt for me, and the guy behind me got mine, and so on),' McIntire shared. He said the customs process was practically 'nonexistent' and he was only asked if he had been to China recently, not other European countries also suffering from the contagious outbreak. Another Twitter user replied that they landed in Seattle, Washington from Tokyo, Japan on Wednesday and faced no screening whatsoever, despite Washington being an outbreak hotspot in the US and 676 cases reported in Japan. Another social media user said they had friends traveling from Vietnam with a lay over in South Korea and they made it through customs with 'incredibly concerning' ease. One woman traveled to the West Coast on three connecting flights from Northern Italy, a hot spot of the coronavirus outbreak. Italy as a whole has 12,000 confirmed cases and a death toll of 827 related to the virus. WHO THE BAN APPLIES TO Most foreign nationals who have been in these countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States* AND WHO IT DOESN'T 'Legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.'* * according to Department of Homeland Security One Twitter user slammed the lack of screening and health checks at US airports as 'gross incompetence'. Kyle Moukheiber tweeted Thursday: 'Just flew home from Europe today to Chicagoâ€™s Ohare airport. There was absolutely no type of screening for anyone coming in. No information. Nothing. This is gross incompetence. I have no symptoms but will be doing a #SelfQuarantine and others should too.' Passengers arriving in New York were surprised to find that they were not screened or even asked about the disease and some saidthey were merely handed information cards that directed them to stay home for 14 days and monitor their health. 'I was nervous, actually, thinking there would be screening, questions, that maybe theyâ€™d tell me to self-quarantine for the first week or something,' Viki Zvolkski, 25, a German national arriving at JFK Thursday night said to DailyMail.com. 'I thought Trump said he would do that. But none of that happened. Measures have not been implement, I guess. Itâ€™s kind of crazy.' It was an emotional night for many of the new arrivals. Maya A., a 22-year-old from France whoâ€™s been studying fine arts in New York the past six months, cried tears of joy, ran up and hugged her mother Hekma, 49, who was arriving from Paris â€” a trip that almost never happened because the mom was originally booked for this Saturday. Maya said she watched Trumpâ€™s speech Thursday night and panicked because it meant her momâ€™s trip would be called off. 'I cried because my mom and all my family, all my friends are in Europe and many of them were planning to visit me in New York,' she told DailyMail.com, 'I miss everyone so much.Luckily, I managed to change my momâ€™s ticket at the last second,' she added. Maya made a welcome sign she crafted with giant pink letters that read, 'MY MOM.' Just before Hekma walked in, though, Maya was still anxious, expecting her mom would get at least some scrutiny by airport screeners because of the Coronavirus. More than 2,000 people have tested positive for the virus in France, with 48 deaths reported as of Wednesday. 'I hope itâ€™s going to be okay, that nobody puts my mom in quarantine,' she said. 'I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen. American people get crazy with this Coronavirus.' But Hekma made it through without even being asked whether she had symptoms. Jordan Lemons, 21, an American who was studying business at a school in southwestern France, said she watched Trumpâ€™s announcement at 2 a.m. Thursday in France. It prompted an immediate call from her dad in Columbus, Ohio. 'Iâ€™ve never seen him panicked before,' Lemons said. 'He got on the Delta website and just saw all of the flights (from France) going away. He was like, ""weâ€™re going to book the first flight home."" We paid over $3,000 - for a one way flight! And then heâ€™s like, ""pack all your stuff."" I had like four suitcases and heâ€™s like, ""get to the airport by 10.""' She made it, and breezed through customs upon arrival at JFK. 'I wasnâ€™t screened, but I got a pamphlet,' she said, presenting a ""health alert"" card that warned: 'You have traveled to a country with an outbreak of COVID-19 and are of higher risk.' It advised recipients to, 'Stay home for the next 14 days and monitor your health. Take your temperature with a thermometer two times a day and watch for symptoms.' Melissa Kosar, 20, a New Jersey resident enrolled in a foreign study program in Strasbough, France, also received an overnight wake up call Thursday from her mom ordering her to come home. 'My mom woke me up at like 2 oâ€™clock in the morning, French time, and was like, ""I just booked your flight, and you need to get on your flight at like 1:40 p.m.,""' Kosar explained. 'I didnâ€™t think I was leaving at all yesterday and then, right after Trump gave that message, my mom was like, ""Youâ€™ve got to leave right now."" She said Trump was banning travel to and from Europe. Then we found out later it wasnâ€™t including U.S. citizens. It wasnâ€™t exactly clear. Anyway, I already had the flight and was probably going to have to come home anyway.' Arriving at JFK, she said, she felt exhausted and disoriented, noting, 'I still havenâ€™t slept and need a nap.' But she was happy, if confused, that she was allowed to exit the airport quickly. 'I was surprised, honestly,' she said. 'It was very easy. I was expecting some screening. People were saying, Oh, you might get quarantined when you come back. But Iâ€™m not sick at all. Iâ€™m happy I didnâ€™t have any issues. Of course, if there are sick people coming in, thatâ€™s a problem.' John Sladavic, 75, and his wife Doreen, 72, arrived at about 6 p.m. Thursday on a Delta flight from Paris. They said that airport was mobbed with people who were scrambling to book last second flights to the United States. 'People were leaving early, so it was packed, and the airport wasnâ€™t prepared for it,' John Sladavic said. 'We had to wait almost an hour and a half there just to get through passport control. We met one woman who paid $1,500 for her flight, so she could leave before Saturday.' Despite the delay, they breezed through customs at JFK. 'I kept waiting to be tested and it never happened,' Doreen Sladavic said. 'But I still feel safe,' she added, prompting her husband to crack, 'Iâ€™d feel safer if we had a different president.' Americans stuck abroad are now clamoring to get back to the US before Trump's Europe flight ban starts at the strike of midnight. This Twitter user said Americans at the Frankfurt airport in Germany were 'angry' with Trump for the order that could leave many stranded. 'Americans are expressing huge frustration at Frankfurt airport. Telling me they're angry with Trump for effectively ordering them home with unclear edicts about border closures. People spent thousands on new tickets and remain unsure when they have to enter US and what happens then,' Twitter user Richard Engel wrote. McIntire also tweeted a picture of the chaos at the Paris-Charles De Gaulle airport where Americans were scrambling to pay as much as $20,000 for last minute flights."
97,13 people are infected with coronavirus after group of friends shared CIGARETTES and DRINKS at a party in Thailand,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108195/13-people-infected-coronavirus-friends-shared-CIGARETTES-DRINKS-party-Thailand.html,"Thailand has today issued a new coronavirus warning after a spike of 13 cases were traced to a group of friends who shared cigarettes and whisky while on a night out. Dr Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary, said that the cluster of cases was caused by party goers who became infected while enjoying Bangkok's nightlife. He told reporters:'There was inappropriate behaviour, sharing drinks, cigarettes and not avoiding social activities after returning from an at-risk country.' Adding: 'Don't share cigarettes and drinks.' The group repeatedly met to socialise in Bangkok on February 21, 27 and 29, reports Thai PBS World. Dr Sukhum Kanchanapimai told the publication that the friends had been 'drinking from the same glass of whisky and smoking the same cigarette in an enclosed air-conditioned room for a long time'. One of the friends had earlier been in contact with tourists from Hong Kong. The group's diagnosis saw the highest daily jump of 11 cases in the country on Thursday. However none of the newly diagnosed patients are believed to be 'super spreaders'. Today Thailandraised its official coronavirus count by five cases, bringing the total to 75. Three of the cases reported on Friday are connected to a confirmed patient who returned from South Korea and went out with friends and family, including the three, to an entertainment venue before being quarantined, saidKanchanapimai. Officials were monitoring the condition of eight other people linked to that case. One person has died of the virus in Thailand. Thirty-five people have recovered and been discharged from hospital. On Monday police raided a house in the Saraburi province, north of Bangkok, after receiving a tip off that workers were putting used face masks in a washing machine before ironing them flat and selling them as if they were new, Coconuts reported. Thousands of masks were seized and taken to a local health department for further investigation. There is a huge demand for surgical masks as the coronavirus continues to spread across the globe. One of the workers told authorities that the used face masks were sourced from an unidentified dealer, according to Colonel Pairot Trisophon from Viharn Daeng Police. The worker said that a face mask would sell for the price of One Thai Baht ($0.05 AUD) and that the group could turn around 300 to 400 masks in a day. Colonel Pairot said that police were seeking the whereabouts of the homeowner, who was identified as a 47-year-old named Jintana Namwichai. There are now more than118,000 cases of coronavirus across the globe. Some 4,291 people have died and 114 countries have been infected. The World Health Organisation declared the worldwide spread a pandemic and advised people to wash their hands at least five times a day with soap and water or hand sanitiser to protect themselves against the virus.

98,"The coronavirus pandemic is putting up to 50 MILLION travel and tourism jobs at risk, with BA warning it will lay off staff and ground aircraft",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-8108413/The-coronavirus-pandemic-putting-50-MILLION-travel-tourism-jobs-risk.html,"Up to 50 million jobs in the travel and tourism sector are at risk due to the global Covid-19 pandemic, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), and BA is warning that it will cut jobs and ground aircraft. The latest figures from the WTTC, which represents the global travel and tourism private sector, show that global travel could be adversely impacted by up to 25 per cent in 2020. This is the equivalent to a loss of three months of global travel, which could lead to a corresponding reduction in jobs of between 12 and 14 per cent. Gloria Guevara, WTTC President & CEO, said: 'WTTC figures show the stark impact on the travel and tourism sector of the present Covid-19 outbreak, with analysis now suggesting that up to 50 million jobs are at risk in the sector globally. 'When the time is right, WTTC and the global private sector will be ready to help and support the government and countries to recover. 'The Covid-19 outbreak clearly presents a significant threat to the industry as a whole, to those employed within it, and those wishing to continue travelling. 'Travel and tourism has the strength to overcome this challenge and will emerge stronger and more robust by taking all necessary measures to tackle Covid-19 and the understandable concern which surrounds it.' The WTTC, which is headquartered in London, is calling for a series of measures to be taken to enable the swift recovery of the sector once Covid-19 is under control. These include the removal or simplification of visas, the lifting of the 80-20 'use it or lose it' airport slot rule for airlines, the reduction or elimination of travellers' taxes and support for hard-hit destinations, such as cash-injections for marketing campaigns. As the WTTC released its figures, BA's CEOAlex Cruz told staff in a global message seen by Reuters that the airline will ground aircraft like never before and lay off staff due to coronavirus, in a battle by the company to tackle what he called the most serious crisis in aviation history. 'It is a crisis of global proportions like no other we have known,' he wrote. 'Please do not underestimate the seriousness of this for our company.' Cruz told staff in the message that jobs would be lost 'perhaps for a short period, perhaps longer term' and that the company was in discussions with trade unions. There were 6,729 new coronavirus cases recorded globally on Thursday, bringing the total confirmed number to 134,317. The death toll rose by 351 to 4,968. It led to several countries being effectively put into lockdown as they closed schools, mass events and shops, while in the US, the mayor of New York declared a state of emergency in the city. The death toll in Italy â€“ the hardest-hit country after China â€“ climbed from 827 to 1,016 and total infections soared by 21 per cent to 15,113."

Taking to Twitter, the viral thread was kicked off by Rae Paoletta from New York, who shared a picture of her cat giving her an intense look, along with the caption: 'Help, I think my new coworker is planning to eat me'. She was quickly inundated with thousands of replies from other users, battling to keep their dogs, rabbits and even rats off their keyboards. Many joked that their dogs couldn't understand why their owners weren't throwing a ball, while others said that their cats had become their new phone assistants, in the cute thread. The viral thread came as research by standing desk manufacturer Vari.com found that it's not all fun and games, with40 per cent of people who work from home admitting they donâ€™t like the pressure and actually work an extra 1-2 hours per day, feeling the need to perform and show their worth. The statistics found that 25 per cent actually work more hours at home than in the office, and this can affect personal and family life. "
100,"Wash your hands, don't hug people - and stop putting biohazard signs on your colleagues' cubicles: Architect of the Capitol BANS coronavirus jokes among its thousands of staffersÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106877/Architect-Capitol-BANS-coronavirus-jokes-like-posting-biohazard-signs-workers-cubes.html,"The other 'AOC' - the Architect of the Capitol - asked those who work on Capitol Hill not to make jokes about the coronavirus outbreak. 'We respectfully request refraining from posting joking signs (such as biohazard) on colleagues of cubicles,' wrote Architect of the CapitolJ. Brett Blanton in a letter dated Thursday and addressed to the entire Congressional community. Blanton suggested that such pranks could spook the Capitol complex's cleaning staff. In a section of his letter labeled, 'Refraining from Jokes,' Blanton wrote, 'Finally,we ask that you consider all of those who are working very hard to clean and disinfect such a large and open campus,' the Architect of the Capitol wrote. He then made the no-biohazard sign ask. The letter also contained a number of standard precautions, urging lawmakers and staff to clean and disinfect their personal workstations, wash their hands for 20 seconds and use hand sanitizer when soap is unavailable. The AOC also advised members of Congress to use 'social distancing.' As outlined by the Office of Attending Physician 'members should adopt a stance that avoidsx close direct contact with other individuals, such as shaking hands, giving/receiving hugs, taking selfies, etc.' A sign hanging on the door of a House committee room Thursday informed the public, 'Due to heightened health concerns, we respectfully ask that you refrain from shaking hands with staff or the Members of Congress.' 'Thank you for understanding,' it said. The letter and signs come after a handful of lawmakers have self-quarantined, first because they came into contact with an individual who had the coronavirus at CPAC - the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Just today, Sen. Lindsey Graham announced he would also self-quarantine due to being at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's Florida resort, last weekend. The press secretary of the Brazilian president - both of whom were in contact with President Trump - tested positive for the virus. Late Wednesday the news broke that a staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, had also tested positive for the virus. In response, Cantwell's D.C. and Washington offices closed and staffers were told to work from home. The Architect of the Capitol letter said that some member suites would be targeted for deep cleaning. Visitors and tourists will no longer be permitted on Capitol Hill after Thursday due to the coronavirus outbreak."
101,East Africa sees its first coronavirus case as woman is confirmed in Kenya after travelling back from US via London,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108717/East-Africa-sees-coronavirus-case-woman-confirmed-Kenya.html,"East Africa has confirmed its first case of coronavirus after a Kenyan woman tested positive for the illness. The region scaled up emergency measures to contain any further spread after the 27-year-old tested positive for COVID-19 in Nairobi. The woman was taken ill seven days after travelling back from the US viaLondonon March 5. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said the woman was in a stable condition as she recovered from the respiratory virus. 'We wish to assure all Kenyans that the government will use all the resources available to fight coronavirus,' Mr Kagwe said, as the government rolled out a raft of new containment measures. The government had traced all the contacts of the patient since she arrived back in Kenya on March 5. 'At the moment, there is absolutely no need for panic and worry,' he added. There are now 14 countries in Africa with confirmed cases of the virus that has swept the globe, infecting more than 130,000 people and killing nearly 5,000. But to date the continent has been spared the worst of the pandemic. Only five people have succumbed to coronavirus so far - all in north Africa - with the sub-Saharan region recording no deaths and very low numbers of confirmed cases. But countries in East Africa - which until the positive case in Kenya, had only recorded negative test results - have been taking precautions. Some flights have been restricted, with Kenya Airways suspending its route to Rome, and charter flights from Italy to the Kenyan coast on hold. It has also suspended international conferences, a top earner in Nairobi, a hub for such events in the region, and non-essential travel abroad for politicians. The government announced more expansive restrictions on Friday, including a temporary ban on major public gatherings, prison visits and activities between schools. Other countries in the region have been rolling out their own measures. Rwanda shares a border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has confirmed cases. The country has placed washing basins with soap and sanitiser on streets for commuters to use before boarding buses. Authorities in Kigali, the capital, have also banned concerts, rallies and trade fairs - although like in Kenya and Uganda, church services have been proceeding and bars, restaurants and entertainment precincts remain open. Neighbouring Burundi, meanwhile, has quarantined 34 people in a hotel in Bujumbura as a precaution. Uganda has ordered that visitors from a number of affected countries self quarantine for 14 days, or consider simply not visiting at all. South Sudan's health ministry said meanwhile that it was 'temporarily suspending direct flights between South Sudan and all affected countries' Kagwe, the Kenyan health minister, also addressed a rumour circulating on social media that people with black skin cannot contract the virus. 'I would like to disabuse that notion. The lady (confirmed with coronavirus in Kenya) is an African, like you and I,' he said."
102,Grand Princess cruise British couple tell of 'terrifying flight' home on windowless cargo plane from the US where SIX coronavirus victims were held in a metal box - and cabin crew wore hazmat suits to serve sandwiches,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108315/Grand-Princess-cruise-British-couple-tell-terrifying-flight-home.html,"A British couple have told how their Â£11,000 cruise from hell on the Grand Princess where 21 passengers caught coronavirus ended with them being airlifted back to the UK on a windowless cargo plane where 'air stewards' wearing hazmat suits served them sandwiches and bottles of water. Denise and Len McConkey say they and 100 other passengers endured a 'truly terrifying' flight back to the UK - as six passengers with confirmed Covid 19 were on board and kept in a metal box in the cargo hold and they were barked at by cabin crew using a megaphone. Speaking to MailOnline back home in London where they are self-isolating until March 25, Denise said passengers from the California cruise were loaded onto a jumbo cargo plane after disembarking and were met at the airport by 'frightening' federal agents wearing protective clothing. 'It was truly terrifying,' said Mrs McConkey. 'We were met at the plane by these federal agents all dressed in hazmat suits. It was like that scene in ET. 'We boarded but there were separate areas for those who had been diagnosed with the virus, those thought to have it and us other passengers.' Mrs McConkey, who runs a mini cab firm in Elton, south London, said an agent told them the plane belonged to a friend of President Trump who had called in a favour to transport the passengers. 'It had no windows and the inside was just bare with these seats clamped onto the metal interior. 'They spoke to us with this scary megaphone - no tannoy or anything and there were loads of places on the bare interior where you could trip up which wasn't ideal for the many elderly travellers. 'It was like we were cattle or something. My dad was so frightened he didn't eat or drink for the whole time. It was a 10-hour flight and it was just exhausting. 'No-one knew where we were going or where we'd be landing - in fact when we touched down we were told we were in London but we were in Birmingham. The organisation was a shambles and no-one really seemed to know what they were doing.' The McConkeys said those with coronavirus were shuffled on board before everyone else and shut in a metal box marked with a biohazard sign. Mrs McConkey said: 'We couldn't see inside the box. There was a big metal door with a swing handle, a bit like a large meat fridge. There was another door on the inside so you couldn't see what was going on. The agents in suits went in to see them. 'We thing that there were six people inside because they all had to fill in a form and an agent came out with six forms in his hand. She went on: 'The cabin crew didn't really act as such. They were just five men in suits. They gave us sandwiches, salads and water on a plastic tray, but you had to look after yourselves. 'There was no safety briefing at all. A man with a megaphone said: 'You all know how to use a seatbelt so let's put them on.' 'He told us that if a blue light flashed then we should all return to our seats as it meant we were hitting turbulence. It was very worrying as we're all used to a safety briefing on board a plane. 'Luckily there was no turbulence - the first we saw of the blue light was when we were coming down to land. We didn't know we were landing because there were no windows. It was very disorientating.' The McConkeys who were confined to their ship cabin for several days have now been told they have to self-isolate for a fortnight and they have had to send their two daughters out of the house. 'One is staying with a friend but the other has had to go to a hotel. It's been a nightmare and one I hope we never experience again.' Mrs McConkey, her father and stepmother Edwin, 82 and Jean, 78, and her husband Len, 66, had booked the holiday of a lifetime - 15-night cruise from San Francisco to Hawaii and back - at a cost of around Â£11,000. But on the return leg from Hawaii passengers began to go down with coronavirus and were eventually told to confine themselves to their cabins. Mrs McConkey said: 'It was an utter nightmare from start to finish. From the moment we were confined to our cabins on the Princess Grand it was a shambles of organisation. 'I can only imagine what it's like to be on a prison ship but I'm pretty sure it's similar to what we experienced. 'It was ridiculous because we couldn't get food and drinks. If you asked for a cup of tea is would take six hours to get to you. The crew were clearly struggling to deal with the situation.' After circling for days after being forbidden to dock at San Francisco they disembarked in Oakland and were transferred to a cargo plane. Following their ordeal, all the passengers were driven home in separate taxis. Mrs McConkey said: 'I was pleased about that. The taxi took us all the way home and we stopped off on the way to pick up a McDonald's - that was our first meal back. We were all starving hungry.' She added: 'We're all so relieved to be back. It was a total nightmare and so exhausting. We're just so pleased to be back in Britain sleeping in our own beds again. Thank goodness it's over.'"

Italian barista serves espresso on a SHOVEL days before the country was put on lockdown over coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109039/Italian-barista-jokingly-serves-espresso-SHOVEL-anti-virus-measure.html,"Italy may be at the centre of one of the worldâ€™s worst coronavirus outbreaks â€“ but it hasnâ€™t stopped some people from finding a moment of humour amid the gloom. This video captures a barista in Florence serving coffee to a customer on a shovel, while joking that it will protect against the virus. The clip was taken in the Tuscan city last week, just days before the entire country was put on lockdown and all shops except for supermarkets and pharmacies shuttered to try and control the spread of the disease. â€˜Anti-virus measures,â€™ the barista can be heard saying in Italian while handing the cup of espresso to the waiting customer. â€˜Anti-virus measures,â€™ he responds, laughing. â€˜Thank you.â€™ Italy officially has the worst coronavirus outbreak outside of China, with 15,000 cases reported and more than 1,000 deaths. Hospitals in the badly-hit north have reported leaving patients in corridors to die as intensive care units were overwhelmed with cases. The country reported its first cases of coronavirus late in January in two tourists from China. It appeared authorities had the spread largely under control until February 21, when a cluster was discovered in Lombardy with no record of travel outside the country. Authorities have not yet discovered how that cluster originated. Since then, the virus has swept across the country. Italy now has the highest rate of infection per-person anywhere in the world, including China. China has since dispatched teams of doctors who helped battle the coronavirus outbreak there to Italy to help, along with tonnes of medical supplies including badly-needed ventilators. Following Italyâ€™s example, dozens of other European countries have also begun shutting down public spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus in a strategy known as â€˜flattening the curveâ€™. Children were staying at home across Europe today as France, Portugal, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Belgium became the latest countries to close schools over coronavirus fears. France has called for a 'massive applying of the brakes' with schools and universities closed for at least two weeks while Disneyland Paris is shutting its doors on Sunday. Portugal is also closing schools, limiting visits to retirement homes and shutting down nightclubs with large public events already cancelled. Four towns have been shut down in Spain where police were today stopping cars on a road near Barcelona. In Italy, which is already in lockdown, Catholic churches in Rome have now been shut as the Vatican falls in line with the rest of the country. Football fixtures across Europe have been taking place behind closed doors amid calls for the Euro 2020 tournament to be postponed. Meanwhile, some European passengers were boarding the last flights to America this morning before Donald Trump's unexpected travel ban comes into force tonight. The drastic measures leave Britain increasingly out of step with the rest of Europe after Boris Johnson yesterday declined to impose a ban on schools or public events. Europe now has a total of 28,550 cases, more than half of them in Italy, and 1,198 deaths. "

106,"Meet Hope Hicks new man! He's 53-year-old Goldman Sachs exec Jim Donovan, who was nominated by Donald Trump for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in 2017 but turned down the job to 'focus on his family' - a wife and four children",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107185/Hope-Hicks-new-man-53-year-old-Goldman-Sachs-exec-Jim-Donovan.html,"Hope Hicksâ€™ new man is Goldman Sachs managing director Jim Donovan, Goldman Sachs managing director, DailyMail.com can reveal. The couple have been dating since at least January when they were spotted holding hands during a dinner at posh restaurant Masseria in Washington D.C. Since then, the pair have enjoyed a romantic weekend in Los Angeles â€“ during which they dined at celebrity hotspots Mr Chow and Nobu â€“ and spent last weekend together in the capital. Massachusetts native Donovan, 53, has four children, two girls and two boys, with estranged wife Christine, 48, a physical therapist. It is unclear whether the couple have divorced. In March 2017, he was nominated by President Trump for the job of Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and would have reported to Steve Mnuchin. But two months later, he dropped out of contention citing family concerns. In a statement released at the time, he said: â€˜I am deeply honored by President Trumpâ€™s decision to nominate me as Deputy Secretary of the U.S Department of the Treasury. â€˜However at this time, I want to focus on my family, and I can no longer accept it. I hope to be able to serve this administration in the future and fully support President Trump and Secretary Steven Mnuchinâ€™s ongoing work to reform the tax system and the U.S economy.â€™ The family were pictured on horses together in a Facebook photo posted in February, 2018. They are members of the Piedmont Fox Hounds Hunt Club in Upperville, Virginia. Along with Hicks and Mnuchin, Donovanâ€™s political connections include Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush. He worked on Bush's 2016 presidential campaign. Along with his role at Goldman Sachs, where he has spent 23 years, he also works as an adjunct professor of corporate strategy at the University of Virginia. DailyMail.com has reached out to Donovan for comment. In LA, the former Trump comms director, who is due to return to her new job at the White House this month, enjoyed a string of romantic outings with Donovan including a double date on Friday, February 21 and a lengthy lunch in Malibu on Saturday, February 22. They were also photographed canoodling together in D.C. in January and again last week after she moved back to the nation's capital. Hicks, 31, has been single since splitting from former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter after they both left the White House in Spring 2018. Porter, 42, who had a girlfriend when he hooked up with Hicks, was forced to resign after DailyMail.com revealed his alleged history of domestic abuse in January 2018. In November 2018, Hicks relocated to Los Angeles to take up a top job with Fox. A little over a year later, she announced she was quitting to return to Washington D.C. DailyMail.com can now reveal that Hicks' new man appears to be one of the reasons for the cross-country move â€“ with the pair first spotted canoodling in D.C. in January. Exclusive pictures taken show the couple holding hands while chatting with friends during a dinner at Michelin-starred Italian restaurant Masseria on January 25. The restaurant, one of the capital's most fashionable, specializes in four and five course tasting menus with prices starting at $98 per person. A source told DailyMailTV: 'They kept holding hands behind his back and were clearly besotted with each other. They couldn't stop smiling.' Hicks returned to Los Angeles shortly afterwards to work out the terms of her departure from Fox and has been busy tying up loose ends. She was seen dropping into Fox headquarters and enjoyed a mid-week visit from her mother Caye, 63, and sister Mary Grace, 33, who spent some of their time sightseeing before leaving, presumably back to Connecticut where they live. Soon after their departure, Hicks' man arrived just in time for the weekend, taking Hicks out to dinner with friends atMr Chow in Beverly Hills. A beaming Hicks made the introductions outside the celebrity hotspot and, according to a source, kept taking hold of her hand during the pricey meal. The pair left together after the two-hour supper and drove back to her Brentwood apartment where they spent the night. The next day, the couple drove out to Malibu where they enjoyed a three-hour lunch at celebrity hotspot Nobu. Hope was seen taking her lover's arm as they made their way into the famous sushi restaurant which is adored by stars ranging from Kim Kardashian to Liam Hemsworth. The restaurant boasts stunning views over the Pacific Ocean and has a secluded private deck with a miniature Japanese garden and comfy wicker arm chairs. Like Mr Chow, lunch doesn't come cheap with a sashimi salad appetizer setting diners back $36 while the famous black cod with miso costs $38. More expensive dishes include the $70 spicy garlic Maine lobster while a simple plate of fish and chips costs $44. Drinks include Lanson Brut Rose champagne for $152 a bottle, premium Hokusetsu YK35 sake which costs $525 and exclusive cocktails such as the tequila-based Paloma Blanca which costs $22. Afterwards, the pair spent another night at Hicks' apartment with neither emerging until the following morning when the 31-year-old was seen strolling up to her local branch of WholeFoods to pick up breakfast. An onlooker told DailyMailTV that the former model couldn't stop smiling during the short outing and was constantly on her phone. Soon afterwards, her new man was seen jumping in a luxury car outside her apartment block which took him to LAX where he boarded a flight bound for D.C. Hicks is due to join him in the capital this month ahead of starting her new job as counselor to the President. Her return to the White House has been welcomed by insiders, among them her replacement as Director of Communications, Stephanie Grisham. When news broke of Hicks' return, Grisham released a statement in which she said Hicks is 'one of the most talented and savvy individuals I have ever worked with'. She added: 'She has always impressed me with her quiet confidence, loyalty and expertise, and I am beyond thrilled to welcome Hope back to the White House.' Hicks will not be returning to her old communications role and will instead be working closely with Jared Kushner and White House political director Brian Jack. In a separate statement, Kushner said: 'There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks. 'We are excited to have her back on the team.'"
107,Microsoft announces its 2020 Build developer conference will now be a 'digital event' after Washington state bans gatherings of 250 people or more amid the coronavirus pandemicÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8108397/Microsoft-takes-developer-conference-virtual-stop-spread-Covid-19.html,"Microsoft has moved its annual 'Build' developer conference online for 2020 in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus and protect its developer community. The decision to move Build online comes as Washington state bans gatherings of more than 250 people amid the increasing spread of the deadly pandemic. The technology giant said instead of cancelling the event outright - as others have done - it will instead hold all of the sessions and talks virtually. Very few details of how the event will work have been revealed but the company said it had made the decision because 'the safety of our community is a top priority.' Scroll down for video The Microsoft Build conference had been scheduled to take place between May 19 and 21 in Seattle and is traditionally used to unveil updates to Windows software. The Washington state company said in a statement it was following health and safety recommendations to help prevent the further spread of the Covid-19 virus. Washington governor, Jay Inslee, announced a ban on events with more than 250 people until the end of March. Build isn't until May but Microsoft is working now to move it online in case that is extended further to a point where it would impact on Build. 'In light of the health safety recommendations for Washington state, we will deliver our annual Microsoft Build event for developers as a digital event, in lieu of an in-person event. 'We look forward to bringing together our community of developers in this new virtual format to learn, connect and code together. 'Stay tuned for more details to come,' the company said in a statement. Microsoft's announcement follows the cancellation of a number of major technology and cultural events including E3, South by South West and Mobile World Congress. Google and Facebook have also cancelled their developer conferences, which had been due to take place in May, with both now expected to have online events. E3 â€“ the annual video games convention in Los Angeles, had been scheduled for June and attracts around 100,000 visitors. Apple hasn't announced whether its developer event WWDC - where it reveals new versions of iOS and macOS - will go ahead. All of the major tech conferences make conference sessions available online, and keynote speeches where major announcements are made are streamed live. On Thursday, Twitter confirmed it had made it mandatory for all staff globally to work from home as it increased its efforts to curb the spread of the virus. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 4,500 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 125,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 â€“ possibly 9,700 â€“ were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 â€“ doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests â€“ caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."

The wrappings are worn like badges of honour during their eight-hour shifts at the Keimyung University Daegu Dongsan Hospital. The hospital is in the southern city at the centre of what has become the largest national outbreak outside of China - where the virus first emerged. The pads, plasters and tape protect their faces from developing lesions while wearing their protective gear for hours on end. Nurse Kim Eun-hee said: 'I'm trying hard.' Teams of full-time and volunteer nurses operate at the hospital - which is one of the biggest in Daegu. They have been lauded for their efforts online, as one comment on South Korea's Naver portal read: 'You guys are truly heroes to me. I am infinitely grateful to you.' Letters of support are also displayed at the hospital. 'The whole nation is behind you,' read one, from a well-wisher who sent thermometers and snacks. Around 200 nurses are working eight-hour shifts at the facility, hospital representative Jung Sang-min told AFP, nearly half of them volunteers. 'More nurses wear bandages than doctors because they spend more time tending patients,' he said, adding that it takes about half an hour to don the protective suits they wear. 'The nurses are the ones who truly dedicate the most in this fight,' Jung said. South Korea on Friday reported 110 new infections, its lowest for three weeks, and for the first time the figure was less than the number of recovered patients discharged. Nurse Park Hye-mi told AFP: 'Soon something good will happen.' It comes after social media posts revealedItalian nurses have been bruised by constant face mask use and left slumped over their desks from exhaustion as they battle the coronavirus crisis. One nurse, Alessia Bonari, posted a picture of her bruised face after wearing protective gear for hours during a shift in Milan. Describing life at the hospital, she revealed how she could not drink or go to the bathroom for six hours after putting on her protective gear. Another nurse,Elena Pagliarini, was pictured slumped over her desk while still wearing her mask at a hospital in Cremona where she had been working around the clock."
109,"Owner of Pomeranian, 13, whose nose was removed to fight off cancer admits strangers judge her for not putting the pet down - but insists her dog is 'happier and healthier than ever'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8108429/Tiny-Pomeranian-left-without-nose-following-battle-cancer.html,"A tiny Pomeranian dog has been left without a nose after surviving a gruelling cancer battle. Poa, who is now known as 'Poa No Nose' by her owners who live in Seattle, Washington, and has her own Instagram account @poanonose, underwent surgery to remove the upper part of her snout to fight off a fast-growing cancer. The 13-year-old pet, who is three quarters Pomeranian and one quarter American Eskimo, was taken to five different vets before they took the drastic measure to save her life. Owner Anna Prosser, a producer and host, said: 'The vet reminded me that Poa didn't look in mirrors. 'They said as long as she could get snuggles and treats, she would heal and be perfectly happy. 'Even when she was at her sickest, Poa made it clear that she had no intention of giving up. So, given that option, I knew it was the right choice.' Poa had surgery in August, three months after the cancer was diagnosed, and wore a head cone while she recuperated. Anna said: 'On some of the most terrible days, Poa sneezed blood, refused to eat, and was agitated all through the night. 'On good days, she slurped wet dog food and didn't hide any of her medicine in her doggy bed. 'It was some of the hardest work I have ever done in my life, but little by little, day by day, she became stronger, until today she seems even happier and healthier than she was before.' Poa even managed to grow a full coat of hair despite struggling with Alopecia X most of her life. Now, even at 13, she still loves to play and walk, and especially snuggle and give kisses. Anna said: 'The first thing people is ""Can she eat?"" and ""Does her tongue stay moist?"" The answer to both of those questions is ""yes"". 'At first, especially when she was fresh out of surgery, it very was jarring to look at. Some people saw Poa and reacted with anger toward me. 'They felt like any dog who looked like her must be suffering, and that I, as her owner, should have made the call to put her to sleep instead of making her endure the aftermath of surgery. 'However, the more they see her happily going about her day to day as a basically normal dog with no nose but plenty of personality, they begin to see her for what she is. 'It is a reminder that even the smallest of us can be very strong. Even the most scarred of us can be beautiful, and that love really can survive anything.' She added: 'I have been overwhelmed by how many people feel encouraged by her and express love for her. 'She was a very cute dog before, but now that she's different, and her face tells a story of survival and hope, people seem to connect to her in a whole new way. 'Messages about her strength giving others hope mean the world. We try to return the favor by posting pictures that make people feel happy, and captions that remind people that they are beautiful and worthy of love, just the way they are.' Anna added: 'These have been some of the happiest times of our life together as companions. 'She's been there for me though so many of life's hardest times, and I feel so happy and proud to have been able to return the favour for my little bestie.'"
110,Hunter Biden's child support is finalized with his stripper baby mama after he tried to use the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to avoid going to Arkansas,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106579/Hunter-Bidens-child-support-finalized-stripper-baby-mama.html,"Hunter Biden has finalized his child support agreement today with his stripper baby mama just in the nick of time to avoid traveling to Arkansas, according to new court papers. The 50-year-old businessman was due to show up to court in Independence County this week to hash out the final terms of the agreement with Lunden Roberts, who is the mother of his 18-month-old child. Biden wasmercilessly slammed by a judge on Wednesday for his Tuesday attempt to put off a deposition and hearing in the case, claiming he was worried aboutflying from LA to Arkansas because he might contract coronavirus and pass it on to his wife Melissa Cohen, who is due to give birth within 2Â½ weeks. But on Thursday, Biden got what he wanted and the hearing was called off after coming to an agreement with Roberts. He will pay anundisclosed amount of monthly child support, healthcare for the child, whose gender is being kept secret, and foot Roberts' legal bill. Hunter, whose father Joe Biden is favourite to become the Democratic Presidential candidate, had at first denied the child was his. Roberts claimed in legal papers that Hunter admitted to her that the baby, who was born in August 2018, is his. DNA testing proved he is indeed the child's father. Neither the name nor the gender of the child have been publicly released. Biden's lawyer, Brett Langdon, said Biden was worried about flying from Los Angeles to Arkansas because he might contract the coronavirus and was also concerned about publicity because he has been a target of Republicans for his ties to a Ukrainian oil company. 'The defendant can come by plane, train or automobile,' Judge Meyer wrote. 'Life and work will and should continue in our communities and courts. 'No health threat specific to the defendant has been identified, reasonable precautions are appropriate.' Meyer, who took over the case in January after previous judge Don McSpadden recused himself, cited her predecessor in her ruling. 'On December 3, 2019 Judge McSpadden prophetically penned a letter warning the parties not to ''drag out'' this matter,' she wrote. Meyer said the due date was known well before the hearing was agreed by Biden's lawyer Brett Langdon, who also knew that Biden was required to attend. 'The defendant's spouse is not allowed to attend his deposition per the prior protective order restricting onlookers,' she wrote. 'And her appearance at the pretrial hearing is not required nor even suggested.' Biden had also asked for both the deposition and the hearing to be put off until after the presidential election, saying he would continue with the level of child support he was paying until the final decision was made. Biden had already agreed a temporary package of support. Roberts gave birth in August 2018. Neither the name nor the gender of the child have been publicly released, and in court papers, the child is referred to by the initials NJR. Biden had repeatedly sought to delay hearings in the case against Roberts, angering Judge Meyer. But earlier this week, he insisted there is good reason not to go ahead. 'This continuance is sought for good cause shown and is not sought for the purpose of delay or to cause prejudice to (Roberts) but rather so that justice may be obtained by all parties and in the best interest of the child,' Langdon wrote to the court. Langdon argued that Biden's travel to Arkansas would be 'oppressive.' The attorney does not explain why he waited until the 11th hour to ask for the delay. The deposition was due to start in Little Rock at 9am on March 11. His motion to delay was filed at 12:27pm on March 10. Biden has already accepted he is the father of Roberts's 18-month-old child, who was conceived while the former vice-president's son was living with his dead brother's widow. They split around the time Roberts first claimed Biden was the father of her child and he married South African Cohen â€” who describes herself as a 'jungle girl' â€” in May last year just 10 days after they met. He met Roberts, 28, when she worked as a stripper, dancing under the name 'Dallas,' at the Mpire Club in Washington, D.C. The former stand-out high school basketball player had been a student at George Washington University. A temporary agreement on child support was reached in December but the court was trying to work out exactly how much Biden is worth before it made a final order"
111,"Surgeon, 69, feared to be France's worst ever paedophile who may have raped 349 children over 30 years goes on trialÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109711/Surgeon-feared-Frances-worst-paedophile-raped-349-children-goes-trial.html,"A retired surgeon suspected of raping or sexually abusing as many as 349 children over nearly three decades has today gone on trial behind closed doors in France in what could be the country's biggest-ever paedophilia scandal. The trial in the western town of Saintes is the first of hundreds of legal complaints against defendant Joel Le Scouarnec to come to court. It is due to run until March 17. Le Scouarnec, 69, is charged in this opening case with raping and sexually abusing four children between 1989 and 2017. The alleged victims included two of his relations, a patient and his neighbour's then six-year-old daughter. Because the victims were minors at the time, the Saintes court ruled on Friday that proceedings would be closed to the public, radio franceinfo said. Le Scouarnec, a specialist in abdominal surgery, was arrested in 2017 when the young girl living next door told her mother that he had exposed himself and molested her. Investigators said a search of Le Scouarnec's home yielded images of child abuse as well as notebooks where the surgeon detailed acts of sexual violence against children from 1989 to 2017. Le Scouarnec has told investigators that he had 'already acted out with children. He has however denied any full sexual penetration and said his diaries included an element of fantasy. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. In 2005, he was convicted of possessing images of child sexual abuse but the surgeon was allowed to continue practising until his arrest in 2017. After the arrest in 2005 he was given a four-month suspended sentence and no order was issued that he undergo any treatment.  "
112,Swing and a miss: CBP discovers half a kilo of cocaine mailed from Colombia to New York that was stuffed inside steel iron golf club shafts,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8109425/CBP-discovers-half-kilo-cocaine-stuffed-inside-steel-iron-golf-club-shafts.html,"An international drug smuggling ring swung and missed in its latest attempt to move cocaine from Colombia all the way to New York. A team ofU.S Customs and Border Protection officers were sifting through incoming mail at Miami International Mail Facility on Monday when they discovered half a kilo of cocaine stuffed inside a set of golf clubs. CBP agents conducting a secondary search of the parcel drilled open one of the golf club's shaft and found a white powdery substance. An on-site lab test confirmed the powder as cocaine. In all, the Border Patrol officers confiscated 1.14 pounds of cocaine with an estimated street value of $30,000. 'Drug Trafficking Organizations are relentless and creative in their attempts to smuggle drugs by any means into the U.S.,' Christopher Maston, CBP Port Director of Field Operations at Miami International Airport, said in a statement, according to NBC 6. 'Our CBP officers are highly skilled in detecting all types of concealment methods to intercept harmful drugs and to keep them from impacting our communities.' At least $233million worth of narcotics have been seized this fiscal year. USBP chief Rodney Scott announced Wednesday that Border Patrol agents have confiscated6,564 pounds of cocaine,6,573 pounds of methamphetamine, 298 pounds of heroin, 239 pounds of fentanyl and 119,077 pounds of marijuana. 'USBP agents continue to seize an increasing amount of dangerous drugs, keeping them out of your neighborhoods and communities,' Scott said. "
113,Stem cells used to grow tiny but functional human organs that can fit together on a computer chip and could be used to finally end animal testing in medical research,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8106889/Scientists-develop-new-way-grow-tiny-organ-samples-minimize-need-animal-testing.html,"Medical researchers have developed a radical new alternative to drug testing on laboratory animals. A joint effort from Wake Forest School Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Ohio State University, the new method relies on miniaturized replicas of human organs, called organoids. The team replicated several different types of organs, including a tiny human liver, heart, lungs, blood vessels, testes, colon, and brain. To make the organoids, stem cells were used to generate 3D tissue cultures, which are around one millionth the size of the normal corresponding organ, according to a report in Popular Mechanics. â€˜We tried to make the organs very much related to how they look inside of you, very similar to how they would look on the macro scale if we were implanting them into you,â€™ Wake Forestâ€™s Anthony Atala said. To ensure each organoid develops accurately, the team used multiple cell types, including immune cells, blood vessel cells, and fibroblasts, which build connective tissue in and around organs. Each organoid functions as close to the same as the source organ it replicates, including the tiny heart replica, which beats around 60 times per minute. Importantly, the organoids arenâ€™t meant to function independently, but are instead linked together in a single biological system small enough to fit on a computer chip. Researchers can then expose these minute biological samples to equally minute amounts of experimental drugs to see how they affect both individual organs and the system as a whole. Atala and his team wanted to show the organoid systems could be used to replace animals in lab experiments, and so they exposed the tiny organoid systems to seven drugs that had previously recalled by the Food and Drug Administration because they caused either liver or heart failure. The seven specific drugs were chosen specifically because they had previously passed standard lab tests and made it onto the market without their negative effects being discovered. â€˜It had been tested in human cell lines by industry and there was no toxicity noted,â€™ Atala said. â€˜It was tested in animal models, no toxicity noted. In Phase 2 and 3 human trials, no toxicity.â€™ â€˜It took 11 years on the market for them to connect the dots to see the heart failure was caused by the medication and the drug was recalled.â€™ In every case, the organoid mini-systems showed the negative effects of the drugs tested, suggesting they could be even more accurate than animal testing. â€˜Itâ€™s always hard to predict how long these things will take due to regulatory oversight, but definitely the hope is that we can reduce and maybe even eliminate animal trials with these systems,â€™ Atala said. Scientific experiments done on live animals are classified by their severity. There are five categories which each experiment fits in to. Sub-threshold When a procedure did not actually cause suffering above the threshold of regulation, i.e. was less than the level of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm that is caused by inserting a hypodermic needle according to good veterinary practice. Non-recovery When the entire procedure was carried out under general anaesthesia without recovery. The animal never woke up after going under the influence of the anaesthetic and died. Mild Any pain or suffering experienced by an animal that was, at worst, only slight or transitory and minor so that the animal returns to its normal state within a short period of time. Moderate The procedure caused a significant and easily detectable disturbance to an animal's normal state, but this was not life threatening. Most surgical procedures carried out under generalanaesthesia and with good post-operative analgesia (i.e. pain relief) would be classed asmoderate. Severe The procedure caused a major departure from the animal's usual state of health and wellbeing. This would usually include long-term disease processes where assistance with normalactivities such as feeding and drinking were required, or where significant deficits in behaviours/activities persist. It includes animals found dead unless an informed decision can bemade that the animal did not suffer severely prior to death. "
114,"France implements harsh new law that makes it illegal to hot rod e-bikes to make them go faster, punishable by up to a year in prison, a $34,000 fine, and a three year license suspension",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8106261/France-proposes-harsh-new-law-make-illegal-hot-rod-e-bikes.html,"The French government has rewritten a part of its law to crack down on electric bike modifications, which it says pose a risk to public safety and increase the likelihood of accidents. A new amendment, L317-1, makes it a crime to modify or hot rod e-bikes, something that applies to owners, importers, distributors, and dealers. People who violate the new law can be fined up to $34,000 (30,000 Euros) and face up to a year in prison. In France, e-bikes are generally considered any bicycle with an electric motor thatâ€™s capable of speeds up to 15mph (25kmh), according to a report from Electrek. Any bicycle that travels faster is legally classified as a moped, sometimes called â€˜speed pedelecs,â€™ which are bound by a different set of traffic laws and allowed to travel at speeds of up to 28mph (45kmh). Violation of the law could also lead to the e-bike being immobilized until its owner can prove itâ€™s been brought back to code. It could result in the personâ€™s driverâ€™s license being revoked for up to three years. While e-bikes have become popular in the last few years, theyâ€™ve also prompted concerns about public safety. In 2018, a 56-year-old woman, Sakine Cihan, died from head trauma after she was hit by an e-bike that was traveling at 30mph. The manâ€™s bike was later found to have been illegally modified to be able to reach such high speeds. The man who hit Cihan, 32-year-old bricklayer Thomas Hanlon, was cleared of charges related to the accident earlier this month, largely due to the fact that the woman had walked nine feet into the crosswalk against a red light. The womanâ€™s sister, Sehriban Tezerdi, urged the government to ban e-bikes in the aftermath. â€˜Something urgently needs to be done before anyone else dies,â€™ she said. â€˜In court they said she stepped out in front of the bike and that she walked straight into it. Iâ€™m acertain itâ€™s because these electric bikes are silent â€“ they are silent killers â€“ and there was no sound to alert her to its fast approach.â€™ â€˜They need to be banned... I know it was an accident but there will be many more if something isnâ€™t done now.â€™ "
115,Disgraced Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter is pictured downing shots during lavish spending spree which saw him blow $250k in campaign funds on FIVE mistresses and lavish vacations before being forced to resign,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107467/Prosecutors-release-trove-evidence-showing-Rep-Duncan-Hunter-wasted-250K-campaign-funds.html,"Prosecutors have released a trove of evidence against former Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter, including photos of him downing shots and on vacation with his wife, ahead of his sentencing for misusing $250,000 of campaign cash to fuel his ritzy lifestyle. The 43-year-old California Representative fought the allegations against him for more than a year but finally pleaded guilty in December 2019 to a federal charge of conspiracy to misuse campaign funds for personal use. Hunter and his wife and former campaign manager, Margaret were accused in a 60-count indictment in August 2018 of illegally misusing the funds. Hunter, who was first elected in 2008, allegedly blew his campaign cash on entertaining a string of mistresses, family trips abroad with his wife, and on a a first class ticket for his familyâ€™s pet rabbit Eggburt. In January the disgraced Congressman was forced to resign from the 50th district seat that he held for almost six terms. Hunterâ€™s sentencing is scheduled for March 17. Prosecutors recommend Hunter be given a 14-month federal prison sentence. The defense is likely to seek a lesser term or no prison time at all. Margaret Hunter, the lawmaker's wife, pleaded guilty in June to conspiring with him to 'knowingly and willingly' convert more than $200,000 in campaign funds for their personal use. Prosecutors released a memo on Wednesday, along with the evidence files, to prove to the public that Hunter deliberately misused funds â€“ even though he said the claims were a politically motivated plot against him. Hunter recklessly spent money on fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, garage doors and on luxury oversea vacations with his wife and kids and designer face cream, prosecutors say. He used funds for a trip to Pittsburgh to attend a Steelers football game in 2010, using campaign money to cover the cost of airfare, a hotel stay, rental vehicle, meals and a luxury box at the game, as per10News. In August 2011 he used campaign funds to finance a lavish trip to Las Vegas with his wife. When asked by his campaign treasurer about the Las Vegas charges on the campaign credit card, Hunter said they were 'all campaign related.' He even dipped into campaign funds for small things likevideo games, beachwear, and coffee. Hunter had extramarital affairs with at least four women and subsidized his rendezvous getaways with them using political donations to his campaign, prosecutors said. Records show that Hunter and his wife were practically broke during their time in Congress. Despite the congressman's wealthy upbringing and $175,000 a year Congressional salary, the Hunters overdrew their checking account more than 1,000 times in a span of just seven years, according to the sentencing memo. 'There was in fact not a single month between 2009 and 2017 when the Hunter family bank account had a positive balance throughout the month,' the filing said. Witnesses told prosecutors that Hunter and is wife were tight on money and Hunter had to check his bank balance before buying a bottle of water. The same witness said Hunterâ€™s politician bigwig father regularly boosted his sonâ€™s income with frequent $1,000 payments to help with the cost of private-school tuition for his three kids, car repairs and even money for clothes. Hunter's father is Duncan Lee Hunter, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Californiaâ€™s 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009 who sought the Republican Party nomination for presidency in 2008. Hunter succeeded his father's Congress seat. 'Rather than admit his guilt and resign his seat in April 2016 when originally questioned, or even in August 2018 when originally charged, Hunter chose to mislead the more than 700,000 people who reside in the 50th congressional district. As we now know, Hunter lied to the people about his guilt. Not once, but countless times. In doing so, he conned voters into electing a soon-to-be-convict,' prosecutors said in Wednesday's memo. 'Our very democracy is at risk when a criminal like Hunter wins an election by weaponizing the tropes of fake news and the deep state. This is not a mere philosophical debate in the 50th Congressional district; it is a fact. 'Hunterâ€™s false narrative about being an innocent politician framed by a partisan Justice Department influenced his 2018 re- election to Congress,' the memo added. Among the expenditures detailed by prosecutors were: $1,008.72 at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort by Duncan for ski trip with mistress $2,569.96 in 22 trips to Barnes & Noble, with Margaret buying books and puzzles for family and friends $6,312.81 by both at Alberstons and Haggen Food & Pharmacy for family groceries $41.04 for a video game for Duncan $704 for five adult and three children's tickets to How the Grinch Stole Christmas by Margaret $65.19 at the Washington D.C.

116,"Back to reality: Paulina Porizkova, 54, shares a sexy topless photo of herself from her Costa Rican vacation as she returns home to New York and all the 'horrible news' of COVID-19Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8106667/Paulina-Porizkova-54-shares-sexy-topless-photo-Costa-Rican-vacation.html,"Paulina Porizkova just got back from a fabulous island vacation â€” and while she's not exactly thrilled to be back in the US in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, she has some pretty fond memories of her trip. On Thursday afternoon the54-year-old Czech bombshell posted a throwback snap taken just a few days earlier, showing herself posing topless in Costa Rica. Paulina faced away from the camera, smiling as she got dressed in a pink bra and underwear in her rented villa. In the sexy snap, Paulina's skin looks sunkissed and her hair is perfectly tousled. Even while getting dressed, the star makes it clear she's a professional supermodel. 'Seems like I could have picked a better time to come back from vacation â€” like never!' she captioned it. 'Oh well â€” in the midst of this sad weather and horrible news, allow me to go back in time â€” only a few days ago... Putting on some pretty pink lingerie to wear under my pretty pink gap dress.' A week ago, she'd shared a photo of herself in that pink Gap dress â€” one that she bought on sale for $25 in 1999 and has worn every summer since. In fact, Paulina helped the dress to go viral last year when she opened up about her bargain fashion find - inspiring Gap to bring the design back to stores. The news prompted dozens of Paulina's fans to call for Gap to enlist the supermodel as a campaign star, while others insisted that they rename the pretty pink dress 'the Paulina'. Paulina has also shared other photos from her holiday, including ones of her swimmingin a pool at a rental home calledVilla Neruda. The $600 per night accommodations have three bedrooms and four baths, and are a short drive fromPlaya Manzanillo and Playa Hermosa. She also shared a shot of herself at the top of a waterfall, wearing just a tiny black bikini. Looking incredibly fit and toned, Paulina showed off her incredible figure while admitting the trip was a much-needed break after months of mourning for her estranged husband, Cars frontman Ric Ocasek, who died in September. In the photo, Paulina posed like the pro that she is, holding one arm above her head and shifting her weight to one side as she flaunted her incredible figure. 'And at the end of the dusty road is this â€” a beautiful waterfall,' she wrote. 'And you cool down and wash the dust off. And then get back on the ATV for some more adventures and dirt.' Commenters went wild over the snap, praising the 54-year-old for looking so fantastic. 'Fit and Fabulous! Way to represent us girls in our 50's!' wrote one. 'Paulina you are absolutely gorgeous!!! Your body is perfect,' said another, while a third commented: 'You look like you did in the 80's Paulina.' 'Gosh ... amazing body! How old are you again?' wrote one more. Others called her an inspiration, and another pleaded: 'Can I have your figure for just 5 minutes to Rock a bikini?!'   Paulina said that she was in need of a vacation, and it appears to be the first one she has taken since traveling to New Orleans in August. At the time, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model also posed a couple of photos of herself enjoying the pool in bikinis. Now, though, her trip fulfilled a different need, not just for relaxation, but for healing. In September, her estranged husband, Cars frontman Ric Ocasek, died at the age of 75. 'Imagine, after going through an emotional hell â€” to land here,' she wrote about the trip. 'Being surrounded by saltwater the temperature of your mother womb, the sounds of monkeys chattering in trees, the scent of damp green leaves and night blooming jasmine, sipping a Negroni while the sun sets over the ocean on the horizon. Grateful doesnâ€™t even begin to describe it. 'I hope you can handle a few weeks of totally shameless vacationing from me,' she added. Paulina has previously opened up about suffering fromdepression after Ric's death. At an annual check-up, she shared an Instagram photo and revealed that she decided not to use medication to get through the hard time. 'Ok, time to restart the systems. First, my annual physical with our longtime family doctor. And agreeing that my current depression needs to be processed rather than medicated. At least for now,' she wrote, ending her post with the hashtag '#startingtheyearright.' Paulina has been documenting her anguish on Instagram for several months, most recently sharing a glimpse into her family's ongoing grieving process after Ric's death. She snapped a photo of one of her two sons crouching down by his father's grave and posted it online, revealing that their children â€”Jonathan, 26, and Oliver, 21 â€” are working together to design a headstone for their dad. 'A simple little mushroom taken off our porch, for now, marks the resting place of their dad...' she captioned the photo. 'The real thing is being designed jointly by both of them: a fitting tribute to the father they adored.' Paulina's poignant post came just days after she opened up to her followers about how hard she was finding it to post day-to-day content from her life without it feeling 'narcissistic.' 'Hey everyone, I'd like to rejoin you, but at the same time, I have the hardest time posting,' she shared. 'Photos of myself, or what I like, seem so narcissistic at the moment... There is so much destruction and pain in the world right now...' What's more, Paulina is dealing with getting older, and has candidly spoken about the feeling associated with that. Posting a selfie without makeup or filters, she revealed her internal struggle to see herself in that light. 'Iâ€™ll be turning 55 soon. At first glance, I think â€” ew. I look so old,' she admitted. 'Grief is certainly no beauty maker. My eyelids are starting to droop. The jowly bits next to my mouth donâ€™t only make me look older but also somehow bitter. The gray in my hair is an easy fix, although, honestly, Iâ€™d love to just grow it out and stop coloring. 'Now, how can I help to make all this â€” what we consider flaws â€” to be seen differently, to be seen as confidence and beauty of a mature age rather than something that needs to be eliminated?' she asked. 'I used to think gray hair was aging, that it was a sign of giving in to being old, but thanks to many glorious and rocking hot women on Instagram, Iâ€™ve totally changed my vision to gray hair being sexy and confident.' Paulina recalled Pink sharing a private conversation she had with her then-six-year-old daughter, Willow, about beauty when she accepted the Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2017. The singer explained that she made her daughter a PowerPoint presentation featuring 'androgynous rockstars and artists that live their truth' after the little girl told her she was the 'ugliest girl' she knew because she looked 'like a boy.' Pink said she told her daughter, 'We take the gravel and the shell and we make a pearl. And we help other people to change so they can see more kinds of beauty.' In her post, Paulina applauded Pink for teaching her child that they should 'help other people discover their beauty' rather than trying to fix themselves. 'Now, that is something to strive for,' she wrote. 'Not change yourself to fit in the box, but to blow up the f*****g box.' The former American's Next Top Model host said she'd like to end her post with a rousing, 'Let's blow up the f*****g box, ladies,' but admitted she's not entirely free from focusing on her looks. 'The truth is that I am a mid-fifties woman,' she wrote. 'Iâ€™m vain and insecure, and next week I could decide to have surgical help to fit the comfortable and warm and familiar box instead of crusading to blow it up. #selfie #truth #beauty #sexyhasnoagelimit.' Paulina and Ric were separated and going through a divorce when he died at the age of 75 on September 15. It was later revealed that he had cut her out of his will, claiming he was 'abandoned' by her. But since they were not legally divorced, Paulina, as his widow, may be entitled under New York law to an 'elective share' of his estate. Ric specifically addressed the rule in his will, stating: 'Even if I should die before our divorce is finalâ€¦ Paulina is not entitled to any elective shareâ€¦ because she has abandoned me.' However, unless it can be proven in court that she did abandon him, she will likely be entitled to a one-third share of the musician's assets, which are listed as $5 million in 'copyrights', $100,000 in 'tangible personal property,' and $15,000 in cash. Paulina met Ric on set while The Cars were filming the music video for Drive in 1984, and she became his third wife in 1989. She announced in May 2018 that they had split the year before after 28 years of marriage. Though they were divorcing, they continued to share a New York townhouse and that is where Paulina found the famed rock star dead on the morning of Sunday, September 15. A medical examiner determined he died from hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with pulmonary emphysema being a contributing factor."
117,DEA posts billboards in Los Angeles announcing $10million reward for help catching the world's most wanted cartel kingpinÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8104859/DEA-posts-billboards-Los-Angeles-offering-10million-ransom-arrest-cartel-kingpin.html,"The Drug Enforcement Agency has posted billboards throughout Los Angeles in hopes the public will help them catch the world's most wanted cartel kingpin. The anti-narcotics agency has paid for adverts along two highways offering a $10million reward for information that leads to the arrest of Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of theJalisco New Generation Cartel. El Mencho is believed to be sick and hiding out in Mexico's Pacific coast mountainous region from where he is directing the transnational organization. One of the billboard is located on 5 Freeway near Slauson Avenue and the other went up on Freeway 10 near Paramount Boulevard. El Mencho, 53, is charged with conspiring to distribute massive amounts of drugs 'for illegal importation into the United States' and using a gun 'during and in relation to these drug trafficking crimes', according to an October 2018 indictment presented in a Washington court. TheSan Francisco-born drug lord is also charged with drug trafficking in the state of Mississippi and was designated as a 'kingpin' under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act in April 2015. It is believed that El Mencho, a former ally of JoaquÃ­n 'El Chapo' GuzmÃ¡n, is suffering from kidney problems and is frequently receiving dialysis for his sickness, according to a Mexican government official who spoke to Union Jalisconewspaper in December. El Mencho's organization operates in 24 of 32 states in Mexico and has shipped cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl-laced heroin to the United States. The cartel, is known to be in control of between one-third and two-thirds of the U.S. drug market. On Wednesday, the DEA announced the arrest of more than 600 members of the cartel who were mostly operating in the states of Texas, California, New York, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Colorado. The organization also has a presence in New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Michigan, New Jersey and Massachusetts. El Mencho, formed his syndicate in 2010 with members of the now-defunct Milenio Cartel, and extended its influence throughout Europe, Asia and Australia, and neighboring countries in Central America,Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel has reigned terror across Mexico, dumping piles of bodies in streets and hanging them from overpasses, while filling the city of Guadalajara with mass graves. Members are at times seen aboard SUVs and pickup trucks patrolling the streets of some of the towns they control with machine guns and hand grenades. They once used rocket launchers to shoot down a Mexican military helicopter. Very little is known of El Mencho's personal life except that he was an aficionado of cockfighting events before coming a top target of the Mexican government. Two of El Mencho's three children are being held by the United States government. Jessica Johana Oseguera, 33, was arrested last February 26 inside a D.C. federal courthouse while appearing at a hearing for her brother, RubÃ©n 'El Menchito' Oseguera GonzÃ¡lez, 30, who was extradited from Mexico on February 20 to face drug charges. Oseguera, a mother of two American-born children,is charged with five counts of violating the Kingpin Act by allegedly laundering money for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. El Menchito has multiple charges relating to conspiracy to distribute narcotics. El Mencho's wife,Rosalinda GonzÃ¡lez Valencia, posted a $67,000 bail bond in September 2018 after spending three months in prison following her arrest over money laundering charges. "
118,"'Big, hairy' male donor hands that were grafted onto Indian female amputee, 18, stun doctors by growing lighter, hairless and more feminine to match her bodyÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8107465/Doctors-left-baffled-Indian-amputees-new-hands-adapt-body.html,"Amputee Shreya Siddanagowder's new hands have been mystifying doctors after their appearance changed to better blend in with her body. Indian student Siddanagowder didn't hesitate when she was offered the hands, even though they were big, dark and hairy, and once belonged to a man. Now though, not only have her new hands become more slender, they have also changed colour to match her skin tone, much to the surprise of doctors who carried out the rare 13-hour transplant. 'The donor was a tall man with big spindly fingers,' Siddanagowder's mother Suma told AFP by phone from their home in Pune in western India. 'Now nobody can make out that they are a man's hands... She has even started wearing jewellery and nail varnish.' Siddanagowder's life was turned upside down in 2016 when, aged 18, she was involved in a bus accident that crushed both her arms. A delay in getting first aid meant that both her hands had to be amputated below the elbow. Only 200 successful hand transplants have taken place worldwide -- including nine in India -- since the first in the United States in 1999 on a man whose left lower limb had been blown off by a firework. The first in India was conducted in 2015 at the Amrita Institute of Medical Science (AIMS) in the southern state of Kerala, where Siddanagowder's family took her. The biggest problem was finding a donor. For cultural reasons, Indian families are often reluctant for the hands of their loved ones to be made available after their death. 'Usually you have to wait for a long time,' said Subramania Iyer, a member of a team of doctors who operated on Siddanagowder. As a result, those seeking a transplant 'are so desperate that they don't mind if the hands are from a different gender', Iyer, a specialist in reconstructive surgery, told AFP. Eventually, the hospital obtained a pair of hands from a man in August 2017. Siddanagowder and her family accepted. The donor hands were first attached by the bones before the tendons, blood vessels and skin were painstakingly stitched together. After the transplant, she had to undergo more than a year of physiotherapy for her body and brain to get used to the new hands and obtain mobility and sensation. Iyer said that the colour of Siddanagowder's hands quickly began to show 'a lot of change', but that it is difficult to pinpoint why. 'It could be because of MSH.... a brain-controlled hormone that stimulates melanin production. We are wondering if MSH levels can really influence the skin colour.' Melanin is a natural pigment that gives skin -- as well as hair and eyes -- their colour. Dr Shehla Agarwal, a leading dermatologist in New Delhi, said that the absence of testosterone explained why the hands became less hairy, and agreed that other hormonal changes might explain the change in colour. But she also cited other possible factors. 'The donor male may have been exposed to more sunlight and physical activity compared to the woman,' Agarwal told AFP. Shreya on her part is loving the transformation - she even wrote her recent college exam with her new hands - and so are her doctors. 'We all feel very happy for her,' said Iyer. 'The best moment was when she sent me a hand-written note on my birthday. I could not have asked for a better birthday gift.'"
119,"Professor, 36, accused of raping a student he met on a sugar daddy website is hit with additional charges after two more women came forward including one who said he wanted to make her his 'personal prostitute'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106471/Professor-accused-raping-student-faces-new-charges.html,"A communications professor atBridgewater State University in Massachusetts who was arrested last week on suspicion of raping a female student was back in jail on Tuesday night, this time after two more students came forward with accusations. Nicholas Pirelli, 36, was taken into custody by the BSU Police on a warrant charging him with trafficking of a person for sexual servitude, distributing obscene matter, sexual conduct for a fee and criminal harassment. Pirelli was arraigned on the new charges on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty. Bridgewater State Police Chief David Tillinghast told the Enterprise News that after news of Pirelli's arrest last week spread on campus, as many as five women have come forward raising concerns about the professor's actions. Two of the women's accounts in particular sparked investigations and led to the new charges being filed against him. According to court records, one student at BSU said she joined the 'sugar daddy' website seeking.com to earn money by talking to men, or sending them photos of herself, but said she had no intention of meeting any of them in person. But earlier this year, she was contacted by a man named 'Nick,' later identified as Pirelli, who allegedly tried to compel her to get together. Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Oâ€™Connell said on Wednesday at Pirelliâ€™s arraignment that what started as 'casual talk' eventually escalated to highly sexually-charged exchanges, with Pirelli allegedly expressing a desire to be dominated by a woman, reported the Boston Globe. At one point, the educator allegedly confided in the student that he has a vast collection of sex toys and offered to pay her for sex, according to the documents. Pirelli is also quoted as writing to the student: 'When a woman is dominant, I want her to tie me down, choke me, and feel strong enough to put me in chastity if she wants to. I want her to feel like she owns every part of my body and can do whatever she wants to it.' The alleged victim told police she repeatedly rejected Pirelli's offers of sex for money, even though the professor electronically sent a total of more than $300 to her Venmo account between January and late February. On February 16, according to the court filing, Pirelli texted the student asking if she had ever had anal sex. She had replied that she had not, and Pirelli offered to 'ease her into it.' He then allegedly offered the woman $200 if she had dinner with him and used a sex toy on him during the meal. The woman told police she was shocked by the proposal and began limiting her interactions with Pirelli, who on one occasion allegedly sent her an unsolicited photo of his erect penis. 'It is clear that Pirelli attempted to recruit [the woman] as his own personal prostitute by enticing her with the promise of money in exchange for sexual acts,' the filing alleges. The criminal harassment charge against Pirelli stems from the account of another student of his, who accused him of sending more than $150 to her Venmo account unprompted, following her on social media, sending her unsolicited emails and seeking her out in the student lunch room. The student said when she found out through her friend that Pirelli was the other woman's 'sugar daddy,' she 'felt a pit in her stomach.' The student told police she repeatedly told Pirelli to stop contacting her, but he continued sending her emails. A judge set Pirelli's new bail at $6,000 and ordered him to wear a GPS device and stay away from the BSU campus. Pirelli was initially arrested on March 4 and charged with rape, indecent assault and battery on a person older than 14 stemming from an incident that allegedly took place on October 20, 2019. The alleged victim in that case is a student at Bridgewater State University but is not enrolled in any of Pirelli's classes. According to court documents, Pirelli and the woman connected via the website seeking.com, Enterprise News reports. The site aims to match 'sugar babies' with sugar daddies,' with Pirelli allegedly telling the student he planned to 'spoil' her. The student told police she sent photos and videos to Pirelli, with some showing her in the nude and undressing. Pirelly allegedly told the student that they would need to be 'discreet' after learning that she attended the university. Pirelli is said to have sought someone who would dominate him with whips and chains. He sent the student photos of himself after she sent hers. The educator and the woman began talking through text applications and he would send her money on various occasions using Venmo. They then met in person, agreeing to meet at a Dunkin'Donuts in West Bridgewater to 'see if they had a good connection in person.' Pirelli sent the woman $20 on Venmo to get to the location. Court documents reveal that Pirelli offered to help her with an essay she was working on to secure an on-campus job, telling the student to come to his office. Prior to her arrival, Pirelli reportedly sent her $50 to go shopping. It was then that the woman claims Pirelli raped her, according to court documents. She claimed that the pair only worked on the essay for about 30 minutes before he locked the door to his office and began forcibly kissing her. She told police that Pirelli then performed forcible anal oral sex on her. The woman said that she continued communicating with Pirelli after the alleged attack in an effort 'to let him down easy' as she grew worried about her standing as a student and ability to get the on campus job. She reported the incident to Bridgewater State University police on March 3. While being interviewed by police, Pirelli is said to have made misleading statements and made it so that he could not be credible. Pirelli was released from jail last week after posting $2,500 bail. BSU shared that the educator was placed on paid leave as soon as they learned of the accusations. 'He has been placed on administrative leave with pay,' a university spokesman said. 'He has been asked not to come to campus without permission from the university.' A statement from the school also said: 'Bridgewater State has zero tolerance for misconduct, abuse or violence against any members of our campus community and is committed to preventing and holding accountable anyone responsible for acts of physical and sexual assault. We are working closely with the district attorney's office in their prosecution of this alleged crime.' Pirelli is due back in court on April 30. "
120,Nine middle school kids in Colorado eat marijuana edibles and go to the hospital after vomiting and feeling dizzyÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106279/Nine-middle-school-kids-Colorado-eat-marijuana-edibles-hospital-vomiting.html,"Nine middle school kids in Colorado were left sickened, bewildered, and hospitalized on Monday after eating marijuana-infused candy. At about 2:15pm on Monday, nine students at Adams City Middle School in Commerce City, Colorado began vomiting and feeling dizzy after they told the school's health clerk they had consumed marijuana edibles. In all, 11 kids at the school the marijuana edibles. 'No one was, at any time, in any life-threatening danger,' Adams 14 School District spokesman John Poynton told KKTV. According to the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, teen marijuana use has reached its highest point in 30 years. Also, people who eat marijuana edibles are 33 times more likely to visit the emergency room than those who inhale the drug,the Annals of Internal Medicine says. One of the unforeseen consequences of legalizing marijuana in Colorado seems to be that more children are visiting the emergency room after using the drug. One study showed that two years after recreational marijuana was legalized in 2014, the number of kids visiting the ER spiked. Exposure to the drug accounted for nearly half of the visits to theChildren's Hospital Colorado, Aurora. 'When you take high-THC marijuana-concentrated oil and you combine that with candy, you're asking for trouble,' said Henny Lasley with Smart Colorado. Smart Colorado is an advocacy group for children founded in 2013 to protect children from the dangers of marijuana. Though they come from the same plant, each marijuana product reacts differently in the body based on how it is heated. Smoking marijuana heats it to nearly 1,500 degrees Farenheit. At this temperature, the burning plant releases carcinogens (though far fewer than come from a cigarette) and smoke that constricts blood vessels and can damage the lungs. The heat also changes the psychoactive component of the plant, THC, from THCA to Delta-9THC. This new form of THC makes its way to receptors in the brain within five to 10 minutes, typically. The effects fade within 60 to 120 minutes. Weed edibles are made by dissolving THC into a fatty substance, typically oil or butter, and cooking the snack at about 300 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, both Delta-9THC and another psychoactive compound are released. The result is a less carcinogenic, but more potent drug. The food has to be processed by the liver, an extra step that delays the onset of a high, which makes it hard to control. Edibles' second psychotropic compound, 11-OH-THC is strong and slips easily through the blood-brain barrier. The body also keeps metabolizing the edible, making the effects of THC last far longer - sometimes as long as 10 hours. "

Miriam Estefany GirÃ³n Luna, 19, a former beauty queen in her native land, was trying to scale a 22-foot steel mesh barrier separatingCiudad JuÃ¡rez, Mexico, andClint, Texas, when she fell and landed on her back. Her partner,Dilver Israel DÃ­az GarcÃ­a, 26, alerted a unit of Border Patrol agents with the El Paso Sector, who called forEmergency Medical Services. An ambulance transportedGirÃ³n Luna to Del Sol Medical Center Hospital in El Paso, Texas, where doctors performed an emergency C-section but were unable to save the baby. Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Librereported that GirÃ³n Luna, who worked back home as a social worker, suffered cerebral hemorrhage, lacerations of the liver and kidneys, and a fracture of the pelvis. GirÃ³n Luna underwent several surgeries before the medical staff declared her dead Tuesday at 2:39pm, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. 'The smugglers quickly left them alone, fading off in the darkness, leaving them to make the final legs of the journey by themselves,' said U.S. Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner Mark Morgan on Thursday.As they attempted to climb the wall, the husband could do nothing but watch as he saw his pregnant wife fall to the ground.' 'This is absolutely tragic. But what is also part of the tragedy is whatâ€™s preventable. Do not listen to the smugglers,' Morgan added. 'They do not care about you. They will abuse you and they will leave you behind to die. That is the truth. Those are the facts.â€ DÃ­az GarcÃ­a was placed in custody of CBP for processing. Eduardo HernÃ¡ndez, Guatemala's vice minister of Foreign Affairs, who visited GirÃ³n Luna while she was hospitalized, said the government would be offering her family support in flying her body back to her hometown of San Marcos for a proper funeral service. According to theWashington Post, at least five Guatemalan migrants seeking unlawful entry into the United States have suffered broken bones and have been diagnosed with other injuries. 'This is a very worrisome trend,' said Tekandi Paniagua, an official with the Guatemalan consulate in Texas. 'People are taking more and more risks, and they're losing their lives.'"
122,"Body-positive underwear brand launches a diverse new campaign that features women of all shapes and sizes, from XS to 3XL, including a drag queen and even some customers",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8104839/Body-positive-underwear-brand-Parade-debuts-diverse-campaign.html,"An underwear brand is hoping to change society's narrow view of what it means to be sexy with a diverse new campaign featuring women from all backgrounds and of all shapes and sizes modeling its designs. Parade, which was first launched just a few months ago, debuted a fun and colorful campaign for its latest collection, Cotton Candy, earlier this week - unveiling images of women sizes XS to 3XL posing alongside one another in the pastel colored designs. And it's not just their sizing that makes them unique and diverse; the brand made sure to select campaign stars who come from a wide range of backgrounds, calling on professional models, a drag queen, musicians, and even some of its most dedicated customers to post in front of the cameras. 'We choose to feature women in a variety of body types, from XS to 3XL, but weâ€™re also celebrating all of these incredible women in our creator community that come from a variety of backgrounds,' CEO and founder Cami Tellez told DailyMail.com. 'Weâ€™ve included musicians, actresses, comedians, YouTube creators, and real members of our community, which we call the Parade Friends.' Cami went on to add that the brand hopes to create a new standard for women when it comes to underwear, moving away from the stereotyped ad campaigns of old, which only featured women of a certain size, usually posed in overtly provocative ways. 'I started Parade because I grew up going to the mall, seeing supermodels blown up on massive storefronts and thinking: this is what it means to be a woman,' she explained. 'While Parade is only 17 weeks old, our ambitions are to set a new paradigm for inclusivity in the underwear industry - we believe all women are dynamic, freewheeling and expressive people who deserve better underwear.' While still relatively new as a company, Parade has worked hard to spread this body-positive messaging as far and wide as it can, offering up a range of fun, yet functional, underwear styles that are available in sizes XS to 3XL. 'I believe that brands inherently write cultural scripts and Iâ€™m excited that weâ€™re launching a womenâ€™s underwear company at a cultural turning point that no longer embraces this one-note idea of sexiness,' Cami said. 'At Parade, we believe in underwear as connective tissue â€” itâ€™s between bodies, which are always political, and style, which is creative. We want to rewrite the American underwear story for all women.' Cami is not taking this mission on by herself however. In addition to working closely alongside her co-founder Jack DeFuria, the brand CEO also enlisted a group of passionate women to model the company's designs. For the latest collection, which Cami reveals was inspired by 'delicate spun sugar, pulling taffy, Dippinâ€™ Dots, syrupy sundae toppings, and our childhood sweet tooth', the brand featured the likes of drag queenWest Dakota, video artistOndine ViÃ±ao, and curvy modelCharlie Max. In the images, the women model the different styles available in the collection - the boyshort, the brief, the cheeky, the thong, and the newly-launched high-rise thong, which Cami revealed was added to the line-up as a result of numerous requests from customers. 'At Parade, we make product by talking directly to our community, and this style was created alongside our almost 600 Parade Friends who asked us for a higher-rise but still comfortable thong in our core fabric platform, our recycled knit Re:Play,' she said. Alongside the underwear, the models wear pretty pastel tops, bringing to life the bubblegum-filled fantasy world that Parade hoped to bring to life through the new designs. 'We think color evokes more than just a mood, it can create an entire world - pastels are so much more than just a spring color, itâ€™s the melted ice at the bottom of a slushee, a bite into a funfetti cake, the nostalgic smell of cherry Lipsmackers,' Cami said of the range. 'As Creative Director and CEO, Iâ€™m inspired by things that provoke the senses and spark joy - we think through taste, touch, scent - weâ€™re really aiming to render a full world with each collection.'"
123,Nearly 140 new minor planets are discovered beyond Neptune that scientists hope will help track down the mysterious Planet Nine,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8105437/Nearly-140-new-minor-planets-discovered-Neptune-help-Planet-Nine.html,"Scientists have identified nearly 140 new minor planets in the darkness just beyond Neptune's orbit. The new findings were made after searching through data gathered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) â€“ a project focused on investigating the dynamics of the universe's expansion by mapping the southern sky. Researchers found a total of 316 minor planets in the data and determined 139 had not been documented before. These objects ranged in distance from about 30 astronomical units (AU), which is close to Neptune's orbit, right out to over 90 AU. Those involved with the study have not only applied a new approach in finding planets, but also believes it will aid future searches for the mysterious Planet Nine. The Dark Energy Survey uses technology to map galaxies, detect supernova and find patters of cosmic structures that help experts learn about the expansion of our universe. It collected infrared and near-infrared data of the southern sky from 2013 through 2019. A University of Pennsylvania graduate student Pedro Bernardinelli said: 'Dedicated TNO [trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)] surveys have a way of seeing the object move, and it's easy to track them down.' 'One of the key things we did in this paper was figure out a way to recover those movements.' Using the first four years of DES data and high-tech software, the team started with a dataset of seven billion 'dots' that represented possible objects detected by the software. Then objects that were present on numerous nights were eliminated, which includes stars, galaxies and supernova â€“ narrowing down the list to 22 million. And then the team cut back to just 400 candidates that were spotted over at least six nights of observation. To filter their list of candidates down to actual TNOs, which are planets located in the far reaches of the solar system, the team identified 139 objects that have never been seen before. These objects ranged in distance from about 30 astronomical units (AU), which is close to Neptune's orbit, right out to over 90 AU. According to the researchers involved, they believe the new way of using TNOs to find planets could help aid their mission to hunt down the elusive Planet Nine. Planet Nine was first theorised by experts at Caltech in 2016 when they spotted that a group of icy objects on the edges of the solar system have tilted orbits. They suggested the orbits of these lumps of ice - so-called Trans-Neptune objects (TNOs) - were warped by the gravitational pull of a ninth planet in the solar system. The objects had elliptical orbits that pointed in the same direction and were tilted 30 degrees 'downward' compared to the plane in which planets circle the sun. While Planet Nine has never been spotted, a number of astronomers - including scientists at NASA - have since released research that supports the theory. Astronomers believe that the orbits of a number of bodies in the distant reaches of the solar system have been disruptedby the pull of an as yet unidentified planet. First proposed by a group at CalTech in the US, this alien world was theorised to explain the distorted paths seen in distant icy bodies. In order to fit in with the data they have, this alien world - popularly called Planet Nine - would need to be roughly four time the size of Earth and ten times the mass. Researchers say a body of this size and mass would explain the clustered paths of a number of icy minor planets beyond Neptune. Its huge orbit would mean it takes between 10,000 and 20,000 years to make a single pass around the sun. The theoretical Planet Nine is based on the gravitational pull it exerts on these bodies, with astronomers confident it will be found in the coming years. Those hoping for theoretical Earth-sized planets proposed by astrologers or science fiction writers - which are 'hiding behind the sun' and linked with Doomsday scenarios - may have to keep searching.

124,Epstein's suicide watch companion says that the sex offender was 'not depressed' but asserts that there WAS 'enough space to hang himself',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8105857/Jeffrey-Epsteins-suicide-watch-companion-says-sex-offender-not-depressed.html,"A former prison inmate who spent hours with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein while he was on suicide watch claims the accused sex trafficker was 'not depressed.' Bill Mersey met the sex offender in 2019 while they were incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correction Center (MCC) in New York City. Mersey, a native of New York, was serving a yearlong sentence for tax evasion at the time. 'When I got to MCC, the first thing I knew, it was going to be really boring,' Mersey explained to Fox Nation for the documentary'The Final Hours of Jeffrey Epstein.' The inmate would soon join the 'Inmate Companion Watch' in an effort to have something to do. The program pairs at-risk inmates with fellow prisoners. 'The responsibilities of suicide watch was essentially to be alert for four hours, sit in front of a window across from one inmate that you're watching,' Mersey added. 'And write down every 15 minutes what's going on.' Epstein, who was awaiting sentencing for charges related to sex trafficking, first attempted suicide on July 23. He was found unconscious in his cell with marks on his neck at the time. 'We had normal guy conversations, a lot of sports, a lot of crime, tons of crime,' he recalled. 'The majority of the conversations were first and foremost about his safety and how to handle prison -- over and over again.' 'He solicited advice on how to handle the general population. He thought that intimidation was going to be a problem.' And while the situation was clearly impacting Epstein, Mersey asserts that the financier was not suicidal. 'He was not depressed, although I would have conversations with him and every so often he'd sort of drift off and I'd go, 'Ah, he's thinking about the s---storm he's in the middle of.'

125,Winona Ryder comes to defense of ex-Johnny Depp and calls Amber Heard's claims of domestic violence 'impossible to believe' in legal declaration,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8107383/Winona-Ryder-defends-ex-Johnny-Depp-against-abuse-claims-defamation-lawsuit-against-Amber-Heard.html,"Johnny Depp got some moral and legal support from an old flame in his defamation case in Virginia against ex-wife Amber Heard. Winona Ryder, who was engaged to Depp during their four-year courtship, came to the defense of the Pirates Of The Caribbean star by filing a declaration claiming she found it hard to believe he would ever commit an act of domestic violence. 'I do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of Johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true,' she said during her legal declaration that was obtained by The Blast. 'I find it extremely upsetting knowing him as I do.' Depp filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife in March 2019 over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in December 2018, in which she claimed she was abused by Depp. As part of the suit, Depp claimed that Heard had in fact physically abused him during the marriage rather than the other way around, a claim Heard has denied. During the opening of Ryder's declaration, shegave a brief history of her relationship with Depp that began back when they first met in 1989 and included starring together in the 1990 romance fantasy Edward Scissorhands. 'I knew Johnny very well years ago. We were together as a couple for four years, and I counted him as my best friend, and as close to me as family. I count our relationship as one of the more significant relationships of my life. I understand that it is very important that I speak from my own experience,' the Stranger Things star stated. Eventually Ryder, 48,gave her thoughts about Heard's accusations of domestic abuse during her two-year marriage to Depp. 'I obviously was not there during his marriage to Amber, but, from my experience, which was so wildly different, I was absolutely shocked, confused and upset when I heard the accusations against him.' The actress added, 'The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations.' Ryder maintained that the man she knew during their romance was never violent or abusive towards her or anyone else. 'I truly and honestly only know him as a really good man- an incredibly loving, extremely caring guy who was so very protective of me and the people that he loves, and I felt so very, very safe with him,' the Reality Bites star explained. She did add that she didn't want to go as far as to call 'anyone a liar.' Depp and Heard were married in February 2015. She ended up filing for divorce in May of 2016, along a temporary restraining order against him, stating in a court declaration that he had been verbally and physically abusive during their relationship. The two sides reached a settlement and finalized the divorce in January 2017, which included the dismissal of the restraining order and Depp paying her $7 million, which she donated to charity. "
126,Great-grandmother of 18 celebrates her birthday each year by posing for a glamorous photo shoot orchestrated by her granddaughter,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8106315/Great-grandmother-18-celebrates-birthday-year-posing-glamorous-photo-shoot.html,"A glamorous great-grandmother of 18 celebrates her birthday every year by posing for playful photo shoots taken by her granddaughter. Florence Knapp, 78, from Des Moines, Iowa, has rung in her past three birthdays in front of the camera after almost dying from kidney failure in January 2018. Her granddaughter Kourtney Knapp, 32, buys her new outfits and pays for her to get her hair, nails, and makeup done to match each year's theme. 'Just before my grandma's 76th birthday she was really sick and they said her kidneys were failing,' Kourtney recalled. 'I realized I needed to start making more memories with her and taking more photos. 'She recovered just in time for her birthday so I decided we would start doing birthday photo shoots every year.' Florencecelebrated her 76th birthday with a Pepsi-themed cake smash, and in the playful photos, she can be seen modeling a printed T-shirt and a blue tutu. 'Everyone thought we were being patriotic but it was actually because my grandma has always loved Pepsi,' Kourtney explained. Florencedressed up as a 1920s flapper to hit the casino for her 77th birthday, and she donned rose gold sequins when she turned 78. Kourtney admitted that she eggs on her grandmother and urges her to adopt cheeky poses and coquettish smiles during the birthday shoots, but she insists that she enjoys the attention. 'My grandma loves it. She gives me a hard time about it â€” she is so stubborn â€” but I know she loves it. She loves getting all dressed up and being pampered,' the mother of six said. 'She thinks it's so funny doing the photo shoots. She probably thinks I'm crazy,' she added.'She laughs and smiles the whole time. She is a really good trooper with it; she always does such a good job.' Kourtney noted that her grandfather passed away when she was pregnant with her oldest son, and she didn't have 'any good pictures of him' because she wasn't a photographer at the time. 'It makes such a huge difference having nice photos to hold onto so I'm just glad I can do that for her and for my family,' she said. The photographer, who started her business Kourtney Klick Photography eight years ago, also arranges full family photos shoots with Florence every Christmas. Kourtney gathersFlorence's five children, 19 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren for both group and individual pictures with her over the holidays. 'The first year I took photos of all my grandmas kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids it was a surprise Christmas present for her,' she said. 'She was so happy, she loved it. She was showing everyone the photos. Now I get her involved with the pictures every year. 'It's a long process and it's always crazy, but it makes my grandma happy for Christmas and that's all that matters,' she added. 'Everyone loves my grandma. All of our family, all my friends, they all love her. She has all her great-grandkids wrapped around her little finger. 'My kids love her so much. My oldest son, she is his favorite person ever. It's amazing for them having their great-grandma around and she still acts like a young person.'"
127,Ex-Patriots fullback Patrick Pass's wife shares troubling pictures of him in a hospital bed to plead with the players' union to reject team owners' proposal that cuts benefits to disabled retirees,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106465/Ex-Patriots-fullbacks-wife-pleads-union-reject-CBA-proposal.html,"With current NFL players set to vote on a collective-bargaining proposal that will affect thousands of their retired former colleagues, the wife of one ex-New England Patriots fullback has posted pictures of her incapacitated husband to plead with the union to reject the owners' offer because it limits disability protection. 'I was iffy about posting these pics,' wrote former Patriots player Patrick Pass's wife Monique. The pictures attached to the Tweet show a lifeless Pass sprawled across a bathroom floor. In others he's seen incapacitated in the hospital. 'I need ppl to see life after NFL,' she continued. 'This was a month ago, my husband suffers from severe migraines and vertigo from his career. My mom called me to tell me she found my husband passed out in her basement bathroom.' Pass had a seven-year career, mostly with the Patriots. According to Monique, he now relies on total and permanent disability benefits, which could be limited if the current NFL players union votes to approve the owners' CBA proposal before Saturday's deadline. Most of the reporting regarding the NFL owners' proposal has centered around the possibility of adding a 17th regular season game, another round of the playoffs, or the players' possibly improving their share of revenue from 47 to 48 percent. But as the former director of disability benefits for the NFL/NFLPA told the Daily Mail,the offer contains several proposals to curtail retired player benefits. 'The CBA it appears to benefit more players than it hurts,' said Paul Scott, who still helps current and former NFL players obtain benefits through his company, Benefits Huddle. 'I'm not defending it one way or another, but on the surface, increasing pensions, more guys having access to benefits [is good]. 'But on the flip side, they're tinkering with the disability and the disability processes and the disability amount by instituting certain offsets for different categories of players. Specifically, players who submitted a disability application with 15 years of their last credited season, known as 'Inactive A' players, can expect to see certain offsets that would limit their benefits when they need them most. One such offset involves social security benefits, which would be deducted from a player's benefits under the proposed CBA. 'Right now guys in Inactive A, their T&P disability is in addition to their social security disability,' Scott said. 'If you're getting $11,250 a month, plus $2,000 in social security, you're getting $13,250.' But under the proposed CBA, instead of adding $2,000 to their monthly benefit, that amount will be deducted from the $11,250 that they were getting from the NFL. What's worse, that figure would be diminished further by proposed offsets involving player pensions. 'If you're getting $11,250 a month, and let's say your pension at 55 is $5,000 a month, you don't get $11,250 plus $5,000,' Scott said. 'You get $11,250 minus $5,000. So your disability is reduced from $11,250 down to $6,250.' A few thousand dollars here or there may not be a major issue for a former player like Peyton Manning, who earned nearly $250 million in his career. But for fullbacks such as Pass, most of whom earned far less than $1 million annually, those offsets could be a major problem. 'Let's say they were approved for total and permanent disability based on their spine and knees ten years ago, and now they've been diagnosed with dementia,' Scott told the Daily Mail. 'The wife can't handle three kids and a disabled 300-pound husband, so they pay for caregivers three or four days a week and if the CBA is approved by the union, their benefits will be reduced.' The problem is not an unfamiliar one for Monique Pass, who has increasingly used the hashtag '#VoteNo' when tweeting about the CBA proposal. 'Billionaire owners are making money off of the disabled and decrepit,' read one recent tweet. She directed another tweet at Carolina Panthers offensive tackle Russell Okung, who recently filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, contending the NFLPA negotiated the agreement with the league in bad faith. 'Good morning Russell,' she wrote. 'My husband is a former NFL player Patrick Pass from NE PATRIOTS 2000-2007 .. we got the news yesterday about taking money away from former players on T&P!! My husband's exact words this morning if this passes they will see a lot of suicides.' In her own Twitter post, former NFL tight end Ryan Neufeld's wife Dawn shared a similar belief: 'Money problems cause depression. Depression causes suicide. Add a sprinkle of #CTE into the mix I fear we will see a rise in former players dealing with depression and suicidal tendencies. Families, mine included, have built our lives around [Ryan's] disability payments. It's sad.' Another issue is that the CBA proposal could narrow the definition of 'disabled' as it pertains to former NFL players, according to retiredoffensive lineman Adam Haayer. 'Why is no NEWS outlet talking about the NFL CBA and their redefining of disability,' Haayer wrote on Twitter. 'How they are going to take money from disabled retired players? How they have a better definition of 'disabled' than the government.' Unfortunately for players like Pass and Haayer, the CBA proposal is expected to be approved, Scott told the Daily Mail. 'It's always class warfare between the active players and the former players - the haves and the have nots,' Scott said. 'My thing is, all these offsets, they may look good on paper and on your bottom line, but they're causing a heck of a lot of guys and their families a heck of a lot of strain.'"
128,Civil Liberties group sues US government for records of facial-recognition use at airports claiming the technology 'enables surveillance on a massive scale',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8106543/Watchdog-sues-data-airport-facial-recognition.html,"A civil liberties watchdog sued the US government Thursday seeking the disclosure of records on the use of facial recognition technology being deployed at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was seeking to force the Department of Homeland Security to release records on its contracts and policies for the technology which has been expanded in recent months. ACLU staff attorney Ashley Gorski said the lawsuit aims to require disclosure of what the government is doing with the data it collects with face-scanning machines. The expanded airport deployment is 'putting us on an extraordinarily dangerous path toward the normalization of face surveillance,' Gorski said in a statement. Attorneys suggested the technology raises 'profound civil-liberties concerns' and 'can enable undetectable, persistent government surveillance on a massive scale.' Scroll down for video 'But because key facts about this surveillance are still secret, the public lacks the information it needs to hold these agencies to account. We're suing to bring some much-needed transparency.' The ACLU said DHS and other federal agencies have declined to respond to freedom of information requests on contracts with airlines, airports and other entities, and on retention policies regarding biometric information collected. 'The little we do know about the government's plans for face surveillance at airports is deeply disturbing,' Gorski said. Facial-recognition technology is used at more than 20 airports across the US to verify travelersâ€™ identification when flying internationally. ACLU said US officials have left open the possibility of mandating face surveillance on all US citizens traveling internationally and that non-citizens are currently unable to opt out of being subjected to the scans. However, privacy advocates argue the technology can be used to track people, as ICE, the FBI and local officials have used the software to determine if a person is a suspected criminal. The lawsuit comes amid increased deployment - and complaints -about the use of facial recognition for law enforcement and private applications. Backers of facial recognition at airports say it can ease long lines and make it easier to catch suspected criminals. But civil liberties activists argue it may be used for intrusive surveillance of innocent people. The ACLU last year sued the FBI to seek disclosure of its database believed to hold at least 640 million images and other biometric data. The images gave the organization the ability to match individuals or request matches again specific people in order to identify the person in question. Facial recognition software works by matching real time images to a previous photograph of a person. Each face has approximately 80 unique nodal points across the eyes, nose, cheeks and mouth which distinguish one person from another. A digital video camera measures the distance between various points on the human face, such as the width of the nose, depth of the eye sockets, distance between the eyes and shape of the jawline. This produces a unique numerical code that can then be linked with a matching code gleaned from a previous photograph. A facial recognition system used by officials in China connects to millions of CCTV cameras and uses artificial intelligence to pick out targets. Experts believe that facial recognition technology will soon overtake fingerprint technology as the most effective way to identify people. "

The latest figures come after Boris Johnson said the government was moving from 'contain' to 'delay' in its fight to stop the spread. Scotland has also recorded its first fatality from the virus taking the UK death toll to 11.  As of 9am today, a total of 32,771 people had been tested, 798 positively, while ten patients who tested positive in the UK have died. Wales earlier announced 13 new cases, taking the total number of infections there to 38. In Scotland, the number of confirmed case has risen to 85 and in Northern Ireland, 29 people have tested positive, an increase of nine today. * Follow our live blog for the latest updates on the coronavirus crisis Today's total rise in confirmed cases in the UK from 590 to 798 is the largest day-on-day increase since the outbreak began - 35% up on the equivalent figure for Thursday. One week ago, on March 6, the total number of cases stood at 163. Today's total of 798 is almost five times greater than the equivalent figure one week ago. While the number of confirmed cases stands at 798, it as been suggested up to 10,000 people could be unknowingly carrying the bug. Dr Hilary Jones urged the government to reconsider their new advice and decisions regarding the latest talks. He told host GMB host Kate Garraway: â€œItâ€™s very likely this virus is widespread in our society right now. â€œOh far more [than 10,000] I would imagine, far more.â€ In an alarming revelation, the UKâ€™s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he thinks coronavirus is likely to become an â€œannual virusâ€. He told BBC Radio 4â€™s Today programme that the Governmentâ€™s approach is about flattening the â€œbroader peakâ€ of the epidemic and developing an immunity among the population. â€œWhat we donâ€™t want is everybody to end up getting it in a short period of time so we swamp and overwhelm NHS services - thatâ€™s the flattening of the peak,â€ he said. â€œYou canâ€™t stop it, so you should end up with a broader peak during which time youâ€™d anticipate that more people would get immunity to this. That in itself becomes a protective part of this process. â€œThis is quite likely, I think, to become an annual virus, an annual seasonal infection.â€ Earlier today, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued new guidance on those travelling to Spain. It advised all but essential travel to parts of the country, including Madrid,Â  La Rioja, the municipalities of La Bastida and Vitoria (both in the Basque Country) and Miranda de Ebro (in Castilla y LeÃ³n). An FCO spokesperson said: â€œWe are advising against all but essential travel to the regions of Madrid, La Rioja and the municipalities of La Bastida, Vitoria and Miranda de Ebro. â€œAirlines are continuing to run flights as normal to and from these areas.â€"

Kimberley Finlayson, 52, was a mum-of-four and award-winning co-founder of FMC, a dentistry publishing and communications company based in Shenley, Hertfordshire. She is the first British coronavirus victim to be named. Her grieving husband Ken tested negative for Covid-19 and has been quarantined at the Sanglah hospital as a precaution since March 8.  Mr Finlayson, a fellow co-founder of FMC, will be allowed to leave after a second negative test. Their four children were not on the holiday with them and have been left devastated back home in the UK. Do you have a coronavirus story? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk. Mrs Finlayson - described as the ""driving force"" of her company and a ""flexible innovator"" - fell ill within days of arriving in Bali and was in a serious condition when she was admitted to Sanglah hospital on Monday. The mum, who had pre-existing health conditions, died in the early hours of Wednesday. Health authorities in Bali said the British woman had contracted coronavirus outside the country and was Indonesia's 25th Covid-19 patient. They said she suffered from a number of pre-existing conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroidism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her husband's health is said to be ""fine"" and he is expected to remain in hospital for a few more days. The Finlaysons had stayed at the five-star Capella Ubud hotel between February 29 and March 3, the day Mrs Finlayson was treated at a private hospital for a fever, Tribun-Bali reported. She was moved to Sanglah hospital on Monday and died within 48 hours. The Capella Ubud hotel has moved its guests to other hotels and stopped taking new arrivals. A deep clean has taken place and staff have been tested for coronavirus and told to self-isolate at home. No other guests or staff have been diagnosed with Covid-19, it is understood. Indonesian health officials were trying to track down people who had contact with Mrs Finlayson. Colleagues at FMC, which employs 45 people, were devastated after being told of Mrs Finlayson's death. Jason Newington, a co-founder and managing director of the firm, told Mirror Online: ""Itâ€™s been such a shock. She was a big part of the company."" In a statement, a spokesperson for FMC said: ""Kimberley Finlayson, one of the co-founders of FMC, has passed away following a short illness. ""A driving force behind the scenes of the company, Kimberleyâ€™s career was defined by a commitment to excellence that helped make FMC the UKâ€™s biggest independent dental publisher. ""She approached the world with an infectious passion, creativity and determination that will forever be written into the fabric of the business. ""She leaves behind an organisation committed to honouring her memory."" The spokesperson, in a statement published by Dentistry magazine, added: ""Kimberleyâ€™s career in dental publishing lasted more than 30 years, but the greatest highs undoubtedly came after establishing FMC with Jason Newington, and her husband Ken. ""Indeed, following that moment, her career was studded with so many highlights that it is difficult to single out just one. A rash of awards forÂ DentistryÂ magazine came throughout the 2000s as the magazine asserted its dominance over the UK dental sector. ""It wasnâ€™t limited to one title: Kimberleyâ€™s ability to inspire her entire team helped FMC earn finalist status as Publishing Company of the Year on numerous occasions during the same period."" Her projects included Stars of Dentistry, which won a national award for event of the year at the Independent Publishing Awards, and the London Dentistry Show. The spokesperson added: ""Woe betide anyone whose dedication slipped below Kimberleyâ€™s exacting standards. ""She demanded much from her people, yet gave back so much more. ""Her generosity outmatched even her determination to excel. ""She championed her family with the same fierce pride with which she approached her business, and her four children were the centre of her world. ""Those fortunate enough to know her will remember a whirlwind of energy and ideas â€“ and an ability to make things happen that few can match. ""Kimberley leaves behind a legacy that will live on for decades to come."" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: â€œWe areÂ supporting a British man in hospital in Bali, and are in touch with the Indonesian health authorities and his insurance provider.â€ Indonesian officials told local media that Mrs Finlayson's body was cremated on Wednesday ""according to the procedure for handling the corpses of people infected with infectious diseases due to viruses"". Ten people have died in Britain after testing positive for coronavirus. All were aged over 60 and had underlying health conditions. A British man in his 70s, who was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, died in Japan last month."
2,What coronavirus does to the human body - and how many people it will really kill,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/what-coronavirus-body-how-many-21685462,"This new strain of highly contagious coronavirus ravages the body - causing symptoms that are similar to the flu - and experts now believe it can live inside the lungs for at least five weeks Coronavirus has infected tens of thousands of patients around the world, yet little is still known about the highly contagious illness. An outbreak of the flu-like disease, now known as Covid-19, first emerged among a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China in late December and it has rapidly spread to Europe and the Americas. The latest studies have found that infected people can pass coronavirus on to others before they even know that they have it, and it takes about five days before signs such as a high fever or a cough to appear. This new strain of coronavirus ravages the human body - putting the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions at risk of death - and experts believe it can live inside respiratory tracts for at least five weeks. Do you have a coronavirus story? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk. The global pandemic has led to travel bans and border closures, the shuttering of buildings such as schools and museums, and put the entire country of Italy and its 60million residents under an unprecedented lockdown. Amid drastic measures to curb the spread of Covid-19, there is no vaccine or specific treatment, and researchers are still learning about how it attacks the body, how it can be treated and if there are any long-term effects. Many of the answers so far have been coming from doctors in China and specifically Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, which were ground zero for the outbreak. Coronavirus infects the tissues and airways deep inside the lungs. Symptoms resemble the flu and include fever, dry cough,fatigue and shortness of breath. Some people suffer muscle pain, a sore throat , a runny nose or diarrhoea. The disease can progress to pneumonia - a lung infection - and cause severe lung damage or organ failure in severe cases. In the most severe cases, a patient can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and die. CT scans of coronavirus patients' lungs show white patches, which indicate ground glass opacity, or fluid. In one case, a 44-year-old man, who worked at the Wuhan seafood market where the virus was initially thought to have been passed to humans, went to a hospital after suffering a high fever and cough for almost two weeks on December 25 last year. A chest CT scan showed white patches and scans taken later showed the opacities had spread significantly. The man was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, but he died a week later. In the US, doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City were the first in America to analyse CT scans of Covid-19 sufferers. The doctors said they identified specific patterns in the lungs of dozens of patients who were hospitalised in China at the height of the epidemic there. The ground glass opacities, or patches, became more dense over time, and the patterns were similar to those found in patients who contracted SARS or MERS. The doctors found ""fully involved lung disease"" in 25 patients who had scans between six and 12 days after they reported symptoms. Connor Reed, 25, was the first British person to contract the illness. He caught it in Wuhan, where he works as an English teacher. Mr Reed, originally from Llandudno, North Wales, has told how he feared he would die and he felt like he was ""suffocating"" and his lungs sounded like ""a paper bag being crumpled up"". He was hospitalised and weeks later tested positive for coronavirus as the illness spread and was identified in China. The UK's Department of Health says on its website: ""Typical symptoms of coronavirus include fever and a cough that may progress to a severe pneumonia causing shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. ""Generally, coronavirus can cause more severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and those with long-term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease."" British health chiefs say most people who contract coronavirus will only suffer mild symptoms. According to the World Health Organisation, about 80 per cent of patients recover without requiring specialist treatment. About one in six suffers a serious case and suffers breathing difficulties. Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, said about one per cent of coronavirus patients in the UK could die. Those who are most at risk include the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. The virus is still very new and doctors are still studying the potential long-term effects. Some signs have emerged during a recent study in Hong Kong, where more than 130 people have been diagnosed. Doctors there said some patients who have recovered from Covid-19 are now suffering from reduced lung function - by as much as 30 per cent - and can no longer do some of the activities they enjoyed in the past. Some are left gasping for air when they they walk quickly, said Dr Owen Tsang Tak-yin, head of the Infectious Disease Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital. He added: ""Some patients might have around a drop of 20 to 30 per cent in lung function."" Experts are still investigating, but it is is spread by droplets in an infected person's coughs or sneezes, which can be brought in through the mouth, nose or eyes of others. Spiked coronavirus particles invade human cells and multiply, causing the infection to develop and spread through the body. Once in the lungs, the virus can cause serious damage and become life-threatening. According to researchers, the lungs can fill with fluid and dead cells, and make it harder for the lungs to supply oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide. The NHS said: ""Because it's a new illness, we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person. ""Similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. ""It's very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food."" Health officials said the virus can live on hard surfaces such as plastic for up to 72 hours and soft surfaces for about 24 hours. There is no specific treatment for coronavirus and it could be a year before a vaccine is rolled out for public use. The NHS said: ""Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. ""Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness. ""You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you have recovered."" In Italy, doctors have been forced to make life-or-death decisions, ultimately overlooking elderly and sicker patients and leaving them to die while focusing on saving younger people or those who have a better chance at recovering. The Department of Health is telling people to stay home for seven days if they have a high temperature and a new, continuous cough. ""This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious,"" it said. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Call NHS 111 for advice. The Department of Health added: ""You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them youâ€™re staying at home. We will not be testing people who are self-isolating with mild symptoms."""
3,Crystal-clear lake waters hide ancient forest where you can swim above the trees,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/usa-canada/ancient-forest-submerged-crystal-clear-21686834,"The Clear Lake has an ancient forest submerged in its crystal-clear waters and you can swim above the trees Adventurers can explore an ancient hidden forest by swimming right above its 80ft-high trees.  Visitors who head to the Clear Lake in Oregon, USA, will find a sunken forest nestled amidst the crystalline waters, and it's nothing short of spectacular.  Unsurprisingly the sunken forest is particularly popular with divers thanks to the weaving tree snags which are home to an abundance of wildlife and fascinating plants.  A particular highlight are the 80ft-high tree trunks which you can see from both in the water and from the surface.  The cold spring water flows which spring from the basalt rocks are also popular with divers.  Meanwhile the clarity of the waters means that there are views up to 100ft to be had, meaning you can often still see the surface. (A word of caution - the waters are pretty cold, so come prepared!).  If you're not a seasoned diver, you can still take in the picturesque views on the water; although no motorised boats are allowed, there are plenty of water sports on offer from canoeing and kayaking to stand-up paddling.  Again, because of how clear the waters are, you can still catch a glimpse of some of the ancient forest as you make your way along the tranquil waters.  The lake was formed around three thousand years ago when a volcanic eruption catapulted a giant flow of lava towards the McKenzie River, scorching the forest in its path.  Nowadays it's surrounded by lush green scenery, colourful plants and an impressive variety of wildlife.  In fact, the nearby McKenzie River trail is a hit with hikers and cyclists thanks to the breathtaking landscape it offers (not to mention there are single track trails along the fascinating lava fields).

6,Truth behind The Beatles split finally explained as unseen photo of Paul McCartney emerges,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/truth-behind-beatles-split-finally-21584294,"The Beatles changed the face of music forever until their break-up in 1970, devastating their millions of fans around the world The Beatles are still the undisputed biggest band to ever have existed. They exploded onto the scene in the 1960s and cracked not only UK but had billions of fans around the world. Screaming girls followed them wherever they went - and every single or album they released shot straight to the top of the charts. John, Paul, George and Ringo eventually stopped touring because they couldn't hear themselves above the din of their excited fans. The Beatles iconic final ever gig was on the roof of their record label, Apple Corp, in the centre of London on January 30, 1969. Huge crowds, many of them on their lunch breaks, gathered on the street to watch history in action and police had to be called to stop the show. They ended on Get Back with John Lennon quipping ""I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we've passed the audition"". Just over a year later, The Beatles were over - leaving their fans heartbroken and inconsolable. They never performed together again. Rumours of huge rows, arguments and splits between the band, and especially the legenedary song writers, Lennon and McCartney, have swirled for more than 50 years. Furious fans blamed Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, and McCartney's, Linda. But Beatlemania was over - and the music world would never be the same again. Three years before the band split for good, John, Paul, George and Ringo were rocked by the death of their long-term manager, Brian Epstein. It left a huge power vacuum at the heart of the band. Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, released in 1966, the year they stopped touring, is regarded as the last album where The Beatles all worked together as a band and were all still pulling in the same direction. Following Epstein's death from a medical drugs overdose, The Beatles lack of business experience added pressure to their already insane schedule. Paul McCartney became the unofficial leader of the group, with John Lennon later admitting the band would not have continued without his efforts. But he also claimed he felt Paul had only taken charge because he was concerned about launching his own solo career. Meanwhile, Paul has since said he felt The Beatles move from musicians to businessmen was a major factor in their break-up. But there were other tensions within the band. George Harrison was writing more and more and many of his songs had been rejected for use on albums by Lennon and McCartney, leaving him frustrated. He was the first Beatle to release a solo album in 1968. But the same year, the boys were back in the studio to record The White Album. One change this time was the almost constant presence of Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, who was there for virtually all the recording sessions. Lennon, encouraged by Yoko, was keen to be ever more experimental, something that jarred with McCartney and already bubbling tensions started to increase. By the time The Beatles album was released in November 1968 the band were no longer carrying out joint interviews - all their public appearances were solo. By this time Lennon had also descended into heroin addiction, creating further issues within The Beatles. At the start of 1969 Apple Corp was in serious financial trouble and Lennon had recruited an outside team to manage his interests within the band. McCartney then recruited his brother-in-laws, Lee and John Eastman, to represent his own interests and after a series of meetings, they were taken on for the whole band. But a series of unfortunate business decisions, which resulted in The Beatles losing control of some of their income from the music they'd made meant the atmosphere within the band further soured. Before long, Ringo, George and John had decided to leave the Eastmans and recruited another expert, Allen Klein to manage their interests and legal matters. This revealed the huge schism and lack of trust between then four men who made up the most successful group in rock history. The Beatles were now only occassionally recording together, with several of them pursuing outside interests and projects. John and Yoko had settled on an international peace project, which was spearheaded by their single Give Peace A Chance. Ringo even fled abroad to spend quality time with his family while George focused his attention on the new acts that had been signed to Apple Records. And, even though tensions showed no signs of easing between the four men who had known each other since they were teenagers growing up in Liverpool, The Beatles weren't yet done with releasing music. The few recording sessions they had all been involved with produced their final album - and iconic cover - Abbey Road. August 18, 1969 was the final time all four Beatles would ever record music together. However, this wasn't written in stone when the album was finished. In the years following their break-up a tape emerged of John, Paul and George meeting at their Abbey Road studios to discuss a follow up to the album. Ringo was in hospital being treated for stomach problems and the rest of the band recorded the meeting so he could be a part of it. John had suggested another album with a single release just before Christmas. Crucially, he also wanted to get rid of the joint writing credits between himself and Paul and instead proposed he, McCartney and George wrote four songs each with Ringo contributing two. In the tape Paul can be heard saying that ""I thought until this album that Georgeâ€™s songs werenâ€™t that good"". Despite the plans, Lennon went on to record Cold Turkey, written about his heroin addiction, with the band he formed with his wife, The Plastic Ono Band. It was an unexpected success and after performing at a festival in Toronto, Canada, John made the decision that he wanted to quit The Beatles. He flew back to London to tell the rest of the band that he wanted ""a divorce"" but as they were at a crucial stage of renegotiating their royalty payments, Paul, George and Ringo persuaded him to keep quiet about his decision. Paul was devastated that John wanted to dissolve the band and fled to the farm he shared with wife, Linda, and their young family. Depressed and left reeling from the what he knew would soon be the end of the band, Paul started secretly recording his first solo album. A release date of April 17, 1970, was agreed with the label. After a threat of legal action from a US film company against The Beatles it was decided that earlier recordings, given the working title Get Back, would be cobbled together into one final album. The finishing touches were put to Let It Be and it quickly became apparent that it's release would clash directly with the date agreed for McCartney's first solo album. Ringo went to Paul's house personally to tell him of the issues - and was met with fury and thrown out. It was then that things truly reached the point of no return - still furious, Paul sent out a press release to journalists along with an advance copy of his first solo album. It contained the bombshell news that he was quitting The Beatles - and made front page news around the world. He didn't claim the band had broke up but tellingly did discuss his ""break with The Beatles"" and that he had no plans to record with his bandmates again. Paul also claimed he was unhappy with the work producer Phil Spector had done on the Let It Be album. The impact was immediate, and brutal for McCartney, whose first two solo offerings were almost universally slated by critics. Ringo, George and John, who had kept to his word and not revealed his plans to quit the band, all felt betrayed by Paul's actions, which they felt were being used to promote his own album. He was also vilified by Beatles fans around the world who placed the blame for the break-up solely at his door. Paul was said to be ""devastated"" by the reaction to his press statement. For months afterwards, the remaining trio insisted this was not the end for the band. John said in an interview that Paul was simply ""causing chaos"" and was only ""sulking"" as he claimed he had done when Epstein wouldn't let him have his own way. Harrison added that it would be ""very selfish"" for The Beatles not to record together again because their music meant so much to their fans. Brutally, he added that the three remaining Beatles had been trying to put the band and the future of the Apple label first instead of ""trying to do what's best for Paul and his in-laws"". In a later interview John reiterated his belief that the band would reunite, saying ""it could be a rebirth or a death. We'll see what it is. It'll probably be a rebirth"". Despite the huge legal problems all four of The Beatles would face if Paul went to court to release himself from the band and from Klein's management, on December 31, 1970, he launched legal action against his bandmates. In heartbreaking echos of a marriage divorce, Paul told the court that the differences between The Beatles were irreconcilable and that they had long ceased to function as a band. The judge agreed and he was released from his contract. Many of the solo efforts of The Beatles who had been on the receiving end of Paul's law suit included thinly veiled swipes at their former bandmate. Often the calmest, it was George who seemed to feel the betrayal the most keenly. At a press conference he said: ""Paul is a fine bass player, but heâ€™s a bit overpowering at times. ""To tell the truth, Iâ€™d join a band with John Lennon any day, but I couldnâ€™t join a band with Paul McCartney. ""Itâ€™s nothing personal; itâ€™s just from a musical point of view."" Four years later, the three other members of the band also parted company with Klein after an acrimonious law suit. For the next decade, the four members of The Beatles were offered huge sums of money to reunite for concerts or an album. All were refused, including a proposal they play a reunion concert to raise hundreds of millions for charity. Then, with John Lennon's tragic death outside his apartment building in New York on December 8, 1980, the chance of reunion was over. However, tensions had dramatically thawed between the group in the intervening years. Paul and John even jammed together in 1974 and over the years the remaining Beatles have collaborated from time to time. They notably worked on the Beatles Anthology in 1994 and re-worked two of John's unfinished songs, Free As A Bird and Real Love. George Harrison lost his battle against lung cancer in 2001 and his former bandmate, Paul, paid an emotional tribute to the man who had been his boyhood friend. He said: ""He was a lovely guy and a very brave man and had a wonderful sense of humour. He is really just my baby brother."" Paul and Ringo are the only two surviving members of the incredible band that changed musical history."
8,"""I had COVID-19 and here is my story"": Woman with coronavirus explains what it's really like - with chilling warning",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/woman-coronavirus-explains-what-its-21680170,"Elizabeth Schneider was at a house party where nobody had any cold of flu symptoms when she caught coronavirus COVID-19 A woman with coronavirus has explained what it's really like to be diagnosed and suffer the symptoms of the deadly illness, and has issued a chilling warning to people around the world. Elizabeth Schneider caught COVID-19 at a house party hosted by her friend, but didn't know how serious it was to begin with. Nobody at the small gathering was coughing or showing any signs of illness. But within three days, 40 per cent of the guests were sick - all suffering with symptoms associated with the virus including a high fever. Writing on Facebook , Elizabeth, from Seattle, said: ""The symptoms appear to be different depending on your constitution and/or age. * Follow our live blog for the latest updates on the coronavirus crisis ""Most of my friends who got it were in their late 40s to early 50s. Iâ€™m in my mid 30s. ""For us it was headache, fever (for first 3 days consistently and then on and off after 3 days), severe body aches and joint pain, and severe fatigue. ""I had a fever that spiked the first night to 103 degrees and eventually came down to 100 and then low grade 99.5. ""Some folks had diarrhea. I felt nauseous one day. Once the fever is gone some were left with nasal congestion, sore throat . ""Only a very few of us had a mild itchy cough. Very few had chest tightness or other respiratory symptoms."" The symptoms lasted between 10 and 16 days for the affected guests, but thankfully none of them were hospitalised. Despite their symptoms, Elizabeth says many of the group struggled to get tested. She ended up going through the Seattle Flu Study, and was quickly told she was positive. She has now completed her self-isolation period and the symptoms have gone but she's still being very careful. She said: ""I have surpassed both deadlines so I am no longer isolating myself however I am avoiding strenuous activity and large crowds and I obviously will not come near you if I see you in public."" She now has a warning for people around the world as coronavirus continues to spread. She said: ""Hand washing doesnâ€™t guarantee you wonâ€™t get sick, especially when folks without symptoms are contagious and could be standing right next to you in any given social situation. ""You more likely than not will not die, but do you want to risk spreading it to a loved one over 60 or someone with an immunity issue? Stay healthy folks! ""I also truly believe the lack of testing is leading to folks believing that they just have a cold or something else going out into public and spreading it. And worse folks with no symptoms are also spreading it as in the case of a person attending a party or social gathering who has no symptoms. ""I know some folks are thinking that this canâ€™t/wonâ€™t impact them. ""I hope it doesnâ€™t but I believe that the overall lack of early and pervasive testing damaged the publicâ€™s ability to avoid the illness here in Seattle. ""All I know is that Seattle has been severely impacted and although Iâ€™m better now I would not wish this very uncomfortable illness on anyone."" I had COVID-19 and here is my story. I made this post public out of several requests from my friends who asked me to share. I hope it gives you some good information and peace of mind! First how easily you can get it. I believe I caught it when attending a small house party at which no one was coughing, sneezing or otherwise displaying any symptoms of illness. It appears that 40% of the attendees of this party ended up sick. The media tells you to wash your hands and avoid anyone with symptoms. I did. There is no way to avoid catching this except avoiding all other humans. 40% of folks were all sick within 3 days of attending the party all with the same/similar symptoms including fever. Second, the symptoms appear to be different depending on your constitution and/or age. Most of my friends who got it were in their late 40s to early 50s. Iâ€™m in my mid 30s. For us it was headache, fever (for first 3 days consistently and then on and off after 3 days), severe body aches and joint pain, and severe fatigue. I had a fever that spiked the first night to 103 degrees and eventually came down to 100 and then low grade 99.5. Some folks had diarrhea. I felt nauseous one day. Once the fever is gone some were left with nasal congestion, sore throat . Only a very few of us had a mild itchy cough. Very few had chest tightness or other respiratory symptoms. Total duration of illness was 10-16 days. The main issue is that without reporting a cough or trouble breathing many of us were refused testing. I got tested through theÂ  Seattle Flu Study . This is a RESEARCH study here in Seattle and they have been testing volunteers for strains of the flu to study transmission within the community. A few weeks ago, they started to test a random subset of samples for COVID-19 infection. They sent my sample to the King County Public Health Department for confirmation; however, I was told that all of the samples that have tested positive in the research study have been confirmed by Public Health. As of Monday March 9th, it has been 13 days since my symptoms started and more than 72 hours since my fever subsided. The King County Public Health Department is recommending you stay isolated for 7 days after the start of symptoms or 72 hours after your fever subsides. I have surpassed both deadlines so I am no longer isolating myself however I am avoiding strenuous activity and large crowds and I obviously will not come near you if I see you in public. I was not hospitalized. Not every country is hospitalizing everyone with a COVID-19 infection and in my case, and in many other cases, I didnâ€™t even go to the doctor because I was recovering on my own and felt it was just a nasty flu strain different from the ones I have been protected from with this seasonâ€™s flu vaccine. I also truly believe the lack of testing is leading to folks believing that they just have a cold or something else going out into public and spreading it. And worse folks with no symptoms are also spreading it as in the case of a person attending a party or social gathering who has no symptoms. I know some folks are thinking that this canâ€™t/wonâ€™t impact them. I hope it doesnâ€™t but I believe that the overall lack of early and pervasive testing damaged the publicâ€™s ability to avoid the illness here in Seattle. All I know is that Seattle has been severely impacted and although Iâ€™m better now I would not wish this very uncomfortable illness on anyone. One thing that I believe may have saved me from getting worse respiratory symptoms is the fact that I consistently took Sudafed, used Afrin nasal spray (3 sprays in each nostril, 3 days at a time and then 3 days off), and used a Neti pot (with purified water). This could have kept my sinuses clear and prevented the symptoms from spreading to my lungs. This is not medical advice: Iâ€™m simply sharing what I did and correlating it with the fact that I had no respiratory symptoms. The two could be entirely unrelated based on the viral strain and viral load that I received. I hope this information helps someone avoid getting sick and/or push to get tested sooner rather than later so you know to isolate before it gets worse or to get medical care if you have respiratory distress. Hand washing doesnâ€™t guarantee you wonâ€™t get sick, especially when folks without symptoms are contagious and could be standing right next to you in any given social situation. You more likely than not will not die, but do you want to risk spreading it to a loved one over 60 or someone with an immunity issue? Stay healthy folks!"

""I have an overhead camera and a HD webcam and it all goes into the same box that my son fitted up that, I believe, is used for gaming.

The President is expected to invoke the Stafford Act, enabling him to direct more Government money to states fighting against the spread of the virus, Bloomberg reports.  States will reportedly be able to ask the Government to cover 75 per cent of their costs in responding to the emergency, under the act. This is thought to include spending on emergency workers, medical supplies, tests, vaccinations and more.  The Stafford Act, named after Senator Robert Stafford, came into being in 1988, providing federal money for disaster areas. Trump is due to hold a press conference at 3pm local time in Washington.

It comes after Brazillian President Jair Bolsonaro, who dined with Trump on Saturday, was reported to have contracted coronavirus.  Bolsonaro has denied the claims, taking to Twitter to confirm he is awaiting the results of a second test. He tweeted: ""Coronavirus exam done with the team that were with JB in USA have not yet been completed."" He later posted on social media to say he had tested negative for the virus. Bolsonaro dined with the US President at Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday night, along with his press secretary, who was diagnosed with the disease following the trip. Pictures and video show Trump, Bolsonaro and his press secretary Fabio Wajngarten all in close proximity on March 7. The UK now has 798 confirmed cases of coronavirus after a record daily jump in cases of 208, with the number of deaths now at 10. Earlier, the UKâ€™s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said 60% of the British population must contract coronavirus to successfully fight the bug which has now killed more than 5,000 people worldwide. The Queen has now cancelled her engagements in Cheshire and Camden next week as Charles and Camilla have axed a forthcoming tour of Cyprus, Jordan and Bosnia.  Spain has declared a state of emergency, with Madrid on lockdown and resorts Ibiza and Majorca closing bars. Meanwhile, a 52-year-old British woman who died from the bug on holiday in Bali has been named and pictured. All Premier League and EFL fixtures have now been suspended until April 3. A number of clubs' players and staff have either tested positive or been forced to self-isolate."
17,Coronavirus UK cases soar as 208 more patients diagnosed taking total to 798,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-coronavirus-uk-cases-soar-21686938,"The latest figures show the biggest 24 hour jump yet as the government moves into the 'delay' phase of its plan to stop the spread of the killer bug The total number of coronavirus cases has soared to 798 after a further 208 were diagnosed in the last 24 hours. The latest figures come after Boris Johnson said the government was moving from 'contain' to 'delay' in its fight to stop the spread. Scotland has also recorded its first fatality from the virus taking the UK death toll to 11.  As of 9am today, a total of 32,771 people had been tested, 798 positively, while ten patients who tested positive in the UK have died. Wales earlier announced 13 new cases, taking the total number of infections there to 38. In Scotland, the number of confirmed case has risen to 85 and in Northern Ireland, 29 people have tested positive, an increase of nine today. * Follow our live blog for the latest updates on the coronavirus crisis Today's total rise in confirmed cases in the UK from 590 to 798 is the largest day-on-day increase since the outbreak began - 35% up on the equivalent figure for Thursday. One week ago, on March 6, the total number of cases stood at 163. Today's total of 798 is almost five times greater than the equivalent figure one week ago. While the number of confirmed cases stands at 798, it as been suggested up to 10,000 people could be unknowingly carrying the bug. Dr Hilary Jones urged the government to reconsider their new advice and decisions regarding the latest talks. He told host GMB host Kate Garraway: â€œItâ€™s very likely this virus is widespread in our society right now. â€œOh far more [than 10,000] I would imagine, far more.â€ In an alarming revelation, the UKâ€™s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he thinks coronavirus is likely to become an â€œannual virusâ€. He told BBC Radio 4â€™s Today programme that the Governmentâ€™s approach is about flattening the â€œbroader peakâ€ of the epidemic and developing an immunity among the population. â€œWhat we donâ€™t want is everybody to end up getting it in a short period of time so we swamp and overwhelm NHS services - thatâ€™s the flattening of the peak,â€ he said. â€œYou canâ€™t stop it, so you should end up with a broader peak during which time youâ€™d anticipate that more people would get immunity to this. That in itself becomes a protective part of this process. â€œThis is quite likely, I think, to become an annual virus, an annual seasonal infection.â€ Earlier today, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued new guidance on those travelling to Spain. It advised all but essential travel to parts of the country, including Madrid,Â  La Rioja, the municipalities of La Bastida and Vitoria (both in the Basque Country) and Miranda de Ebro (in Castilla y LeÃ³n). An FCO spokesperson said: â€œWe are advising against all but essential travel to the regions of Madrid, La Rioja and the municipalities of La Bastida, Vitoria and Miranda de Ebro. â€œAirlines are continuing to run flights as normal to and from these areas.â€"

More patients died of the virus today at Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust in Greater Manchester and Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust across Surrey and parts of south London. Now three people have died of Covid-19 at each of these groups.  The total death toll in the country has increased more than 50% in the last 24 hours.  Twenty-two other NHS Trusts have recorded at least one death each since the start of the month. Many of these patients were elderly, and had underlying health conditions.  But dad-to-two Nick Matthews, at 59, was reportedly the youngest person in Britain to die from Covid-19 after being treated at a University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust facility.

Three people have died at both of those NHS Trusts after being tested positive for the virus. The list below collates data accurate as of 5pm on Sunday March 15, 2020. It lists the deaths recorded at each NHS Trust. Some, however, are yet to announce any deaths of patients whom have tested positive for Covid-19.

""Both patients were admitted with underlying health conditions and subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. ""The families have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. We will not be commenting further and ask that everybody respects the family's privacy."" Dr Chris Brookes, chief medical officer for North Manchester General Hospital, said: ""Sadly we can confirm that two patients being treated for Covid-19 have died in our specialist regional infectious diseases unit at North Manchester General Hospital. ""The two patients were elderly and both had underlying health problems. One of the patients was a man in his 80s and the other patient was a woman in her 70s. ""Their families have been informed and our thoughts and condolences are with them at this difficult and distressing time."" David Loughton, chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said: ""Sadly we can confirm that a woman who was being cared for at New Cross Hospital, and had tested positive for Covid-19, has died. ""The patient, who died on March 14, was in her 60s and had underlying health conditions. ""Her family has been informed and our thoughts and condolences are with them at this difficult and distressing time. ""The media are asked to respect the wishes of the families and the interests of staff at the hospital to avoid any disruption to operational services."" The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 exceeded 1,300 today. More than 400 of these are in London, but a further 175 are in the southeast of England. Public Health England has offered clarity on the worst-affected upper tier local authorities, which include Westminster, Hertfordshire and Hampshire. The majority of these areas are in the south of England, including boroughs of the capital. However, Leeds, West Yorkshire, has almost 20 recorded cases of the virus. Many authorities in England are yet to record a confirmed case.  The list below is in numerical order. Hampshire:Â 53 Kensington and Chelsea:Â 40 Westminster:Â 35 Hertfordshire:Â 32 Southwark:Â 30 Lambeth:Â 26 Barnet:Â 25 Oxfordshire:Â 24 Surrey:Â 23 Camden:Â 22 Q: Will my pension be affected? A: It depends what type of pension youâ€™re paying into, how far off retirement you are, or if you have already retired. As a general rule of thumb, the longer you are from retiring, the less reason there is to be concerned. Q: Iâ€™ve got a private pension and am a few months off retiring? A: The closer you get to retiring, the more of your pot your pension provider will shift from equities (shares) into other assets, such as cash. Doing so will limit the impact of the slump should you opt for an annuity â€“ an insurance policy that pays out in retirement. Q: Iâ€™m retired and I opted for a drawdown pension. How am I affected? A: Drawdowns allow you to flexibly take cash out of your pension pot as and when you want. But your funds remain invested and, therefore, at the mercy of stock markets, so can go down as well as up. Q: Iâ€™m in a defined benefit pension, including a final salary scheme, will I be affected? A: Unlikely. While the share slump could well hit the fund youâ€™re in, itâ€™s the responsibility of the firm thatâ€™s behind it. As long as the firm â€“ or â€œsponsorâ€ â€“ is doing OK, youâ€™ll be fine.

They were being cared for at 12 different NHS Trusts across the country, including ones in Manchester, Epsom, Wolverhampton and Bristol.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed on Sunday that everyone over 70 in the UK will be asked to self-isolate for months to protect themselves from coronavirus. He admitted it was a ""very big ask"", but a measure which is for their own ""self-protection"". Asked to confirm reports of the drastic measure which emerged last night, Mr Hancock said: â€œThat is in the action plan, yes. â€œAnd we'll be setting it out with more detail when it is the right time to do so because we appreciate that is a very big ask for elderly and vulnerable people.â€ He said the strategy would be introduced â€œin the coming weeks.â€ And he said the government is prepared to ban large gatherings if necessary. Mr Hancock coronavirus is ""a very significant challenge"" that will ""disrupt the lives of almost everybody"" in the UK. Speaking to The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC, he added: ""The thing the NHS needs now more than anything else is more ventilators. We've been buying as many as we can but we need to produce more too. ""We are going to take the powers to make sure that we can quarantine people if they are a risk to public health, yes, and that's important. ""I doubt that actually we will need to use it much, because people have been very responsible."" A series of drastic measures which will have a profound impact on everyday life are expected to be brought in over the coming weeks. New government plans could see schools and pubs close, the army called in to stock supermarket shelves and all over-70s may have to self-isolate for four months. Today it also emerged that police could arrest sick people refusing to stay in quarantine as the government draws up emergency coronavirus laws. The government will have the power to force people into quarantine, close shops, pubs and restaurants if necessary to tackle the spread of coronavirus. Q: Will my pension be affected? A: It depends what type of pension youâ€™re paying into, how far off retirement you are, or if you have already retired. As a general rule of thumb, the longer you are from retiring, the less reason there is to be concerned. Q: Iâ€™ve got a private pension and am a few months off retiring?

The 59-year-old man, who had underlying health conditions, died in a hospital in Bristol city centre. His devastated wife called him her ""soul mate,"" according to reports today.

2,Laura Woods set to replace Alan Brazil as talkSPORTâ€™s main breakfast show host,https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/laura-woods-set-replace-alan-21696423,"EXCLUSIVE: Woods has been a hugely successful and popular stand-in and co-host on the station and is now preparing to do the show every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday Laura Woods is set to become talkSPORTâ€™s main breakfast show host.  It comes after after Alan Brazil admitted he was going into â€œsemi retirementâ€ and present the show just twice a week as first revealed in Mirror Sport in January.  Sky Sports star Woods has been a hugely successful and popular stand-in and co-host on the station and is now preparing to do the show every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. It is likely that Rangers legend Ally McCoist will be alongside Woods for the start of each week as part of the shake-up after Brazilâ€™s 20-year stint in the show. Brazil, 60, still has the best listening figures on the station and is hugely popular but talkSPORT bosses are making the change with the legendary presenter set to also be involved in some big sporting events. Brazil said: â€œAfter 20 years of early-morning starts, Monday to Friday, that's me entering into semi-retirement with talkSPORT. ""From this week, I'll only be assaulting the airwaves on Thursdays and Fridays. ""But I'll still be hurting your eardrums in the build-up to the weekend football action - whenever it restarts - and around even more when the big events come along.â€ They were going to announce the change to Brazilâ€™s schedule last week but it is a sensitive time with the coronavirus. Brazil has become known down the years for his easy style, loveable gaffes but also his late night drunken antics, especially during the Cheltenham Festival when his no-shows have been legendary. To keep with tradition, Brazil did not show up on Friday and called in sick with a bad back with Woods stepping in at the last minute to co-present. Regular stand-in Max Rushden will host from Monday to Wednesday this week while the details are finalised for Woods to take over on a more permanent basis. She is already hugely popular with the listeners."
5,Government's new coronavirus plans in full from shutting pubs and isolating over-70s to calling in army,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-governments-new-plans-full-21695359,"A series of 'wartime-style' measures which will have a drastic impact on everyday life are set to be brought in as the UK battles the coronavirus pandemic The UK government is gearing up for a 'wartime-style' mobilisation effort to reduce pressure on the NHS as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold. A total of 21 people have now died of the flu-like virus in the UK, with the total number of confirmed cases reaching 1,140. A series of drastic measures which will have a profound impact on everyday life are expected to be brought in over the coming weeks. New government plans could see schools and pubs close, the army called in to stock supermarket shelves and all over-70s may have to self-isolate for four months. Here's a list of the plans in full. Follow our LIVE blog for updates on the coronavirus outbreak People in Britain aged over 70 are likely to be instructed to stay in strict isolation as part of a planned response to COVID-19. A government source has told ITV's political editor Robert Peston that the policy could be announced within the next five to 20 days and would last four months. The source said chief medical officer Chris Whitty and the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance are, however, waiting for the best time to roll out measures that will obstruct people's lives. The government is concerned that some older people could die at home from neglect after they are quarantined, so want to start the self-isolation as late as possible. Gatherings of 500 or more people face being banned this week. Meanwhile leaked government plans suggest that pubs will temporarily close after next week. Bars and restaurants also face shutting their doors some time after next weekend, when the ban on mass public gatherings is enforced. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the NHS to buy up thousands of private hospital beds as the coronavirus death toll doubled today. Eight thousand private hospital beds will be used to relieve pressure on the NHS as it battles the flu-like virus. The plan to pay the private sector Â£300 a day for a bed followed demands by Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth and the GMB union. Other measures being planned include hotels and other buildings being used as temporary hospitals, privately-run hospitals being converted into emergency medical care centres and commissioning several companies to make respirators that can keep acutely ill victims alive. The PM has told health equipment firms to move heaven and earth to churn out as many life-saving ventilators as they can. Schools would close for a few weeks but children of key workers will be allowed to continue attending, with skeleton staff providing childcare. As the US banned flights from the UK, planes en route to Spain had to turn around mid-air yesterday. The airline Jet2 has taken the decision to cancel all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands with immediate effect after the country entered lockdown. TUI has also released a statement telling all customers that holidays booked to Spain between today and Monday have been cancelled. Thousands of British troops are on standby to help keep the UK functioning if coronavirus hits â€œpeak virusâ€ next month. This could be enforced within 20 days to save lives and prevent the NHS 'falling over'. Under the codename Operation Rescript, Lieutenant-General Tyrone Urch has drawn up contingency plans to keep supermarkets shelves full and petrol stations topped up with fuel. Hundreds of Army drivers could be drafted in to keep the nation supplied with food and fuel.

6,Man transforms Â£250 prison van into 'stunning' summer house for his wife,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/man-transforms-250-prison-van-21697041,"A retired man who couldn't believe his eyes when he saw how much a new conservatory or outbuilding would cost, so decided to take matters into his own hands  When you think of a summer house, you probably don't picture an old prison van.  But one man has completely transformed that very vehicle into a unique space for he and his wife to relax in. Retired Graham Skidmore, 74, from Barrow Hill, Worcestershire, bought the police van, which was used to transport prison inmates to court, for Â£250. He then transformed the inside and furnished it, with the total cost for the project setting him back Â£750.  This is a massive saving, compared with the Â£42,000 he was quoted for a conservatory or the Â£12,000 it would have set him back for a new outbuilding.  Upon seeing his handiwork, Graham's wife Sandra, joked: ""I hope he doesn't lock me and throw away the key."" The father-of-four is very happy with the new summer house, admitting that it offers better views than from their house. He said: ""The position is superb. ""Those views are more open than the views we get from the windows in the house. ""I go out there now and with half an hour's sun in the winter, the place is warm and I've fallen asleep in there three times."" Before, starting his DIY project, the van had five cells inside and a latrine running down the middle. Graham stripped the whole thing bare over five months, keeping a few of the original features - including heavy duty prison doors and a hatch that the prison guard driver would have used to speak to prisoners. He recalls how he initially planned to make the space out of a horse box, as he used to work in that industry. ""I rang a few friends to try and get one of these glasonite containers. ""They are built very lightly to take more weight when they are carrying horses. ""Everyone I spoke to said they didn't have any of the size I wanted. They were all about 20ft long. ""I would have to cut it down and a lot more work."" He continued: ""But one guy said 'I tell you what I have got, I've got a prison van container just up the road from you.' ""I thought that's going to be dreadful. I let it fly for a week and then thought I'd go and have a look. ""When I went down, there were 20 all in a row. I thought that is exactly what I want. I bought it there and then."" He then went on a mission to complete the job cheaply. He haggled and found bargains, adding his son's old patio doors, reduced furniture from a garden centre and a sofa a neighbour was throwing away. ""It's not been easy, but it has quite amazed me,"" he said of the process. Sandra added: ""It's absolutely stunning. I never thought it would turn out like this."""
7,"Will the next virusÂ start in here? Wild animal market still selling live wild otters, rats, herons and turtles 11 weeks after coronavirus breakout",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/coronavirus-market-still-selling-rats-21694123,"EXCLUSIVE: Creatures are being cooked alive for customers in grim conditions at Vietnam's Thanh Hoa Bird Market, barely 11 weeks since Coronavirus is said to have originated at similar market in China Herons, reptiles, otters and rodents are still being sold at a wild animal market in Vietnam amid fears new diseases could be unleashed. Creatures are slaughtered on the spot and some are cooked alive for customers at Thanh Hoa Bird Market, where 50 stalls stretch a kilometre along the roadside outside Ho Chi Minh City. Conditions are grim. Flies hover over products and waste drips into drains. It is barely 11 weeks since coronavirus is thought to have originated at a similar market in Wuhan, China. But at Thanh Hoa â€“ and hundreds of other similar markets across the world â€“ life, and death, continues apace. Even RABID dogs are traded, it is claimed. Animal charities warn the trade could spark a new virus and called for an immediate global ban on wild animal markets. China banned the selling and eating of wild animals in an attempt to control the coronavirus outbreak â€“ widely accepted to have emerged at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Snakes, rats and bats were sold there before the shutdown on January 1. But in many countries bans are not in place â€“ as our exclusive images from Long An, southern Vietnam, reveal. Experts warn markets are hotspots for â€œzoonotic diseasesâ€ which can be transmitted from animal or insect to humans. Thanh Hoa market straddles National Highway 62, 50 miles south of Ho Chi Minh City. It is one of Vietnamâ€™s largest live wildlife meat markets. Describing scenes during trade on Friday, one horrified visitor said: â€œBirds are displayed from morning to night. Products were kept for long enough to attract flies and looked very unhygienic. â€œThe waste is sprayed down into the drain. Buyers find it unbreathable due to the stink of bird droppings and food. â€œLive birds are locked in cages and in some cases legs are tied into bunches. Sellers also sew their eyes, tape beaks, break wings, pluck feathers and use a mini gas cylinder to quickly cook them alive. Dead ones are processed and stored. â€œBesides birds, it is easy to find turtles, snakes, otters, rabbits, rats and poultry. One trader said he provides about 70kg of bird every morning and sold about 80,000 birds â€“ equal to 16 tons â€“ every year.â€ Just last month local birds were linked to the virus H5N6. Some 23,000, mostly ducks and chickens, were culled at 10 farms, Vietnamese media said. Days ago, after mounting pressure, the government ordered its Ministry of Agriculture and Rural development to draft a ban on wildlife markets and submit it no later than April 1. But Mai Nguyen, of Humane Society International, called for a swift clampdown on trade. She said: â€œThe existence of markets like Thanh Hoa is a both an animal cruelty and public safety concern. â€œAll manner of animals and birds are crammed together in often filthy, unsanitary conditions. This could result in a health disaster.â€ And she claimed: â€œIt could contribute to the extinction of species.â€ Investigators have witnessed disturbing trade in wild animals across the globe. HSI president Jeffrey Flocken said: â€œChina has taken decisive action but wildlife markets, particularly in Asia and Africa, are widespread and could easily be the start of disease outbreaks in the future.â€ HSI warned Indonesia has hundreds of â€œextremeâ€ animal markets offering a perfect breeding ground for viruses. At the Tomohon market in North Sulawesi, live dogs sit alongside dead ones burned to a crisp with a blowtorch. Claiming rabid dogs were traded in Indonesia, Mr Flocken went on: â€œWe know from our investigations rabies-positive dogs are sold and slaughtered for consumption in these markets. â€œGiven that dogs are caged and slaughtered alongside snakes, bats and rats, Indonesia must take measures to ensure it does not become the next point of origin of a deadly virus. â€œThe trade can spawn global health crises like the coronavirus, SARS and the deadly bird flu.â€ Just last month HSI teams in Africa witnessed the sale of scales from endangered pangolins â€“ an anteater and a suspected host of coronavirus. The scales are used in Chinese medicine despite having no proven value. The pangolin has been identified as a possible source of the current pandemic. South China Agricultural University said coronaviruses carried by it are a close match to Covid-19. This remains unconfirmed and it is not yet clear whether pangolins were sold in Wuhan. So efforts to locate the source go on â€“ with snakes and bats also touted as possible hosts. In India, pangolins once on sale in Manipur are now understood to have been taken â€œundergroundâ€ to avoid detection following a 2017 trading ban.Â Â  Markets in Africa also pose a risk. HSI investigators in Lofa County, Liberia, captured footage of pangolin scales being sold at a market four weeks ago. Wendy Higgins, HSI director, said: â€œA local guy was arrested. Pangolins in Africa are targeted by poachers for scales mainly, but also for their meat.â€Â  Poaching, trafficking and selling of eight pangolin species is banned. But hunting persists and is said to account for a fifth of all illegal wildlife trade. HSI warnings were echoed by Prof Andrew Cunningham, Deputy Director of Science at the Zoological Society of London. He said: â€œLive wild animal markets are ideal places for zoonotic virus emergence to occur. The highest priority for the protection of human health is, therefore, to ban markets and regulate any future wildlife trade.â€ And Dr Richard Thomas, of wildlife trade charity TRAFFIC, said: â€œRegulating markets for disease control is essential and efforts to curtail trade in wildlife products should be a priority.â€ Covid-19 is the latest outbreak believed to have originated in animals. SARS originated at a market in Guangdong, southern China, in 2002. Swine flu stemmed from pigs in Mexico in 2009 and the Zika virus of 2014 was carried by mosquitoes."

Dozens of people were waiting outside a Tesco with their shopping carts even before opening time. Customers were also spotted in front of a branch of Superdrug in Woolwich, south-east London. They reportedly cleared out the store's selection of hand sanitiser despite a limit of two per customer.  Retailers in the UK have urged customers not to stockpile , asking everyone to work together to ensure there is enough food for the country.  Members of British Retail Consortium sent a letter to consumers which reads: ""We know that many of you are worried about the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19).   Do you have a coronavirus story to share? EmailÂ  webnews@mirror.co.uk   ""We want to let you know that we are doing everything we can so that you and your families have the food and essentials you need. ""But we need your help too. ""We would ask everyone to be considerate in the way they shop. ""We understand your concerns, but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. ""There is enough for everyone if we all work together. ""Together we can make sure we are looking out for family, friends, neighbours. ""Together we will care for those around us and those who are elderly, vulnerable or choosing to remain at home."" Shelves at supermarkets across the UK have been left empty and messy as shoppers flocked to stores - even though the Government has told Britons not to ""panic buy"". A person posted a photo of a Tesco in North London yesterday with the caption: ""Ridiculous scenes in Tesco Colney Hatch this morning. ""Shelves cleared like there's been a riot. ""The selfishness of some people filling their trolleys with multiple packs and leaving none for others is staggering."" The supermarket chain has restricted sales of essential food and household items as a result of coronavirus stockpiling.  Waitrose has also introduced a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes,Â  BBC Â reports.  According to a survey from Retail Economics, as many as one in 10 UK consumers is stockpiling, based on a sample of 2,000 shoppers.  Last week, anÂ  amusement arcade Â replaced toys with toilet rolls ""to spread some cheer in the wake of the coronavirus crisis"".  Owner Eddy Chapman said: â€œI think all this panic buying of toilet roll has been loo-dicrous, and so I came up with this idea to hopefully get people to calm down.â€ The UK total of confirmed coronavirus cases currently stands at 1,174 after 34 new patients were diagnosed in Wales today. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The goal here is to protect life and the measures that we take have got to be sustainable and making sure they are sustainable is a critical part of deciding when you bring them in, but we will stop at nothing to fight this virus."""

One man was man mugged outside Savers with someone grabbing his loo roll, while a stampede formed at Aldi as frantic customers raced to get their hands on newly delivered stock.   Many shelves have been stripped bare in the last week or so, with shoppers spotted filling up their trolley and leaving vulnerable adults unable to pick up their weekly goods, reports DevonLive .  The Government has urged people not to panic buy and says there will be enough items for everyone. Here is a list of the restrictions in place at each supermarket. Milk, pastas and anti-bacterial wipes all have a five-item maximum on the number people can buy. The restrictions started online on Sunday morning and in stores on Saturday afternoon. The supermarket has sold out of many types of pasta online Waitrose is restricting online sales of certain anti-bacterial soaps and wipes. The supermarket is in talks with supplies to increase orders, reports BBC. Some stores have also introduced their own restrictions at a local level. A post on the Morrisons website, reads: ""You may notice that delivery slots for our online groceries service are becoming less readily available as demand for home deliveries increases. We're working hard to facilitate as many orders as we can, however please be aware that you may need to book your slot further in advance than usual. ""You will also discover that there is a maximum order number on selected products so we can make sure our customers still have access to essential products."" A post on the Asda website, reads: ""Like most retailers, we have seen a heightened demand for products both in stores and online â€“ particularly on items like hand sanitizer and cleaning products and as a result, have implemented a two item limit on purchasing these items. ""Whilst we are doing everything we can to maintain the availability of products for all our customers, we are asking our customers to shop responsibly in our stores and online so that everyone has access to the essentials. ""We are also grateful to our colleagues for their efforts to make sure our shelves are being refilled regularly and would ask customers to be patient with them as they try to meet this increased demand for products on the shop floor."" The supermarket will be setting a limit of five units per customer on a small number of products such as hand wash, toilet rolls and cleaners. Aldi has restricted all items in its store to four units. The budget chain tweeted to say it had seen an ""unprecedented demand"" across its range and its wants to make all of its customers can purchase everything. It added: ""All our stores remain open and continue to serve our valued customers. We have good product availability and our colleagues are working tirelessly to restock and replenish shelves as quickly as they can."" No restrictions have been confirmed yet. Toilet roll has been rationed to two 12-packs per customer. The website and app crashed yesterday as people rushed to buy food. The outrage came as the company said it was struggling to fulfil demand and that new customers would not be able to use the site.  ""In this time of unusual demand, we have made the call to temporarily prioritise deliveries for you, our existing customers. This means, after today we will not be processing new customer bookings for the time being,"" it wrote on Facebook .  ""Naturally, we are very sorry to have to disappoint anyone that chooses Ocado, and weâ€™re working hard to increase our delivery capacity."" The High Street chemist Boots has restricted the sales of hand sanitisers to two per person. As of Saturday afternoon, 21 people in the UK have died from the virus so far, with 1,140 people testing positive.

The Armenian, who only spent 18 months at the Emirates, headed for Italy in the summer as he looked to resurrect his career.  And now the Italians want to keep the playmaker but several pieces of the jigsaw still need to fall into place as negotiations begin, reports Gazetta dello Sport .   Mkhitaryan has struggled since he came to England with Manchester United in 2016.  Arsenal are not desperate to keep the midfielder but much will rest on how much they want for the 31-year-old. Roma will also be wary about the length of contract the player requests given his age. The Italians will supposedly rebuff Mkhitaryan if he seeks a three-year deal. Injuries have been an issue for the Borussia Dortmund man meaning he has made just 16 appearances, although he has still scored seven times. Mkhitaryan is not the only Premier League loanee playing at the Stadio Olympico with Roma also keen on keeping Chris Smalling. The defender was willing let go by United last summer but has proved to be a big hit. Arsenal are also thought to be keen on Smalling though which could play a part in negotiations for Mkhitaryan. Roma boss Paulo Fonseca has been vocal in his praise for both players this term. ""Mkhi during this season got some injuries but he is returning now and he is proving his quality,"" he told Sky Sports. ""Chris is a great, great man, a great, great professional. I would like Chris to stay. We are speaking. ""I don't know if it is possible because of the situation with Manchester United, but I would like so much for Chris to stay here with us because he is very important."""

The victim was reportedly found with the knife still embedded in his back as he lay dead in a pool of blood. He has been named locally as Jaydon McFarlane, 19. Detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate launched a murder hunt before arresting three people, including two teenagers. The youth's body was found in the road in Ashford, Kent on Saturday morning. The alarm was raised shortly before 12.30pm after the man was discovered by a passer-by at a junction in Ashford. Detective Chief Inspector Gavin Moss urged anyone who was walking, cycling or driving in the area of Brookfield Road, near Clockhouse before or after 12.27pm, to come forward. He added: ""In particular, I would like to invite any motorists or cyclists who were in the area to contact us and submit their dashcam or video footage for detectives to review.' Neighbours said that they had been told the victim still had the knife embedded in his back when he was found by the passer-by who raised the alarm.

Scotland reported its second death. The true number of Covid-19 infections was likely much higher as patients with mild symptoms are not being tested and other carriers may not be showing any symptoms. The Governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance suggested there could be as many as 55,000 coronavirus cases already in the UK, and researchers have said as many as 250,000 could die of the Government doesnâ€™t change tactics.

The Foreign Secretary said the government does not have a precise number of UK nationals travelling overseas. But he said the government would be concentrating on â€œthe most vulnerable.â€ Mr Raab made the comment in the House of Commons after confirming new travel advice urging against unnecessary travel.t would be â€œunrealisticâ€ to expect the government to be able to repatriate all British people travelling abroad, Dominic Raab has said. He said: â€œGiven the volume - we donâ€™t have precise numbers - but the volume of British nationals who are abroad, not permanently, not living abroad necessarily, but travelling abroad - to expect that the government can repatriate them all I think would be unrealistic. â€œWhat we do do is make sure that weâ€™re in a position to protect the most vulnerable.â€ Read more on Raabâ€™s speech here The Archbishops expressed the desire that church buildings may, where practical, remain open as places of prayer for the community, observing social distancing recommendations. They also invited clergy to maintain the ancient pattern of daily prayer and, where possible, the eucharist â€“ live streaming their worship if they have the resources to do so. And they urged congregations to be in the forefront of providing practical care and support for the most poor and the most vulnerable during the crisis. â€œBeing a part of the Church of England is going to look very different in the days ahead,â€ they wrote. â€œOur life is going to be less characterised by attendance at church on Sunday, and more characterised by the prayer and service we offer each day. â€œWe may not be able to pray with people in the ways that we are used to, but we can certainly pray for people. And we can certainly offer practical care and support.  â€œPlease do carry on supporting the local foodbank and buy extra provisions for it. Ensure the night shelters wherever possible are kept open. There are many very encouraging schemes happening right across our country in communities to focus on caring for the most vulnerable and do continue to play your part in those. â€œThen by our service, and by our love, Jesus Christ will be made known, and the hope of the gospel â€“ a hope that can counter fear and isolation - will spread across our land.â€ The Archbishops of Canterbury and York are calling for Church of England churches to put public worship on hold and become a â€œdifferent sort of churchâ€ in the coming months to face the challenge of coronavirus. In a joint letter, Archbishops Justin Welby and John Sentamu said it was now necessary to put public services on hold until further notice. But they said that far from having to â€œshut up shopâ€, the Church of England must face the challenge by becoming a radically different kind of church rooted in prayer and serving others. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted he wants to â€œhelpâ€ schools to stay open despite mounting calls for them to shut. He said he is following the medical advice - and if that advises schools to be shut, the government will take that step. He added it was â€œonly rightâ€ that Ofsted inspections are suspended.

Victoria Morrison, 30, is devastated that she cannot spend the day with Kyle, eight, and must instead remain in isolation. Her other son Tyler, two, came down with a soaring temperature and a cough last week, prompting her to call 111.

FCO travel advice can range from advising against all travel to a whole country to recommending travellers seek advice before travelling to a particular area, based on how safe it is to visit. Mr Raab told MPs: â€œUK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lock downs in various countries. The speed and range of those measures across other countries is unprecedented. â€œSo I have taken the decision to advise British nationals against all non-essential international travel.â€ The FCO has said that whether travel is essential or not is a personal decision and circumstances differ from person to person. They say those who make the decision to travel should check their travel insurance. UK inward and outward travel has already fallen by a significant amount since the outbreak of coronavirus. Ryanair, Virgin and EasyJet have cut flights by 80% this month and IAG has decreased capacity by 75%. In the last week 430 changes have been made to FCO Travel Advice â€“ more than in the entirety of 2019.

2,Mum's sadness at being separated from dying son on Mother's Day because her other son has coronavirus and she has to isolate,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-mums-sadness-being-separated-21706417,"EXCLUSIVE Kyle Morrison, from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, will be separated from his mum Victoria on Mother's Day because his two-year-old brother Tyler has coronavirus symptoms A mum will be apart from her son who has a terminal brain tumour on Mother's Day because her other boy has been told he has coronavirus. Victoria Morrison, 30, is devastated that she cannot spend the day with Kyle, eight, and must instead remain in isolation. Her other son Tyler, two, came down with a soaring temperature and a cough last week, prompting her to call 111. NHS professionals diagnosed Tyler over the phone and told Victoria to isolate with him for two weeks at their home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. They were told to stay away from Kyle however, whose diagnosis in September last year with a rare form of cancer makes him extremely vulnerable to the coronavirus. While Tyler fights through his illness alongside Victoria, Kyle has gone to stay with his grandma. It means the Andrew Lanes Primary School boy, who doctors said had just a year to live, faces spending Mothers Day away from his mum. Victoria told Mirror Online: ""I'm actually dreading this Mother's Day. ""As I'm talking about it now I well up because this could be my last with Kyle and that thought breaks my heart. ""It literally crushes it."" On September 11 this year Victoria Morrison dropped her son Kyle off at Andrew Lanes Primary School in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. A few hours later she received a call from a staff member saying she had to come in and pick him up. When Victoria arrived five minutes later she immediately knew something was seriously wrong. ""He was having a stroke,"" the mum explained. ""The right side of his face had dropped. The eye and the corner of his mouth was drooping. It was really noticeable."" The Lego fanatic was convinced that he was fine, but doctors at the Lister Hospital near Stevenage disagreed with Kyle's diagnosis and made him stay in overnight. The next morning he was put through an MRI scanner and by the afternoon the results were in. ""I got called into the room and got given the news that he had a tumour,"" Victoria explained. ""I was quite blunt. I knew it was going to be a stroke, brain tumour or blood on the brain. ""I said 'tell me now which one is it' and the doctor did."" Kyle and Victoria were raced to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge where doctors carried out further tests. What they discovered turned a traumatic day into a devastating one for the Morrison family. Kyle had a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) tumor. While brain tumor sufferers in the UK do not have a great prognosis - with only 15% living five years after diagnosis - significantly less than one in 100 DIPG sufferers survive for five years. Most children die within one to four months. So far Kyle has been living with the tumour for at last six months and is doing surprisingly well. Victoria said: ""He's absolutely fantastic. I was expecting him to go downhill quite quickly, but he's getting better. ""In January he had an MRI and the doctors said the tumour had shrunk. ""No one can tell me what his life expectancy is now. Some have said eight to 12 months. I have a feeling in my gut he will make it to 12 months."" Although Kyle has not been told that he is terminally ill, hundreds of people count themselves amongst his supporters. With the help of generously donated funds Kyle, Tyler and Victoria flew out to Lapland over Christmas. ""He couldn't understand why he was getting all these gifts,"" the mum said. ""When we flew out there was a big inflatable Santa sitting on his seat and at the hotel he got a present every day. ""The only day he was poorly was on Christmas Day, which meant he couldn't meet Santa. ""Father Christmas video-called him while he lay in bed instead."" Before she went into isolation, Victoria made sure Kyle had as much fun as possible with trips out to the zoo and his local soft play zone. In her spare time she has spearheaded a campaign to raise Â£350,000 for experimental treatment in Seattle. While DIPG has no known cure, the radical therapy - in which doctors take stem cells from the spine and inject them into the tumour - has successfully beaten similar cancers before. Victoria plans to continue fundraising from isolation and once she is allowed out, but for now she's stuck at home, wishing she could spend what could be his last Mother's Day with her boy.

3,"Inside Adele's tumultuous five years off - divorce, 'celeb lover' and a major life overhaul",https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-adeles-tumultuous-five-years-21700314,"Adele admits that since releasing her last album, 25, life has 'tried me so hard' - but all that is starting to change When Adele released her last album 25 five years ago, she was still shopping at Waitrose and living in Blighty with boyfriend Simon Konecki and their young son Angelo. But as the platinum-selling singer gears up to release her long-awaited fourth album this September, both the star and her life have been through some major changes. From her relationship status and friends to her lifestyle and where she calls home, the star's set-up is a world away from the life she wrote about on 25. When her tour wrapped in June 2017 she was newly married to charity boss Simon and bowed out of the limelight to be a stay-at-home mum, introducing herself as such on a raucous night out in New York with bestie Jennifer Lawrence. Sick of renting dud properties, she bought an Â£8.2million mansion in an exclusive Beverley Hills suburb, where she counts Jennifer and Katy Perry among her neighbours. Making the most of her new pad, she generously hosted a no-expense spared wedding for comedian Alan Carr and his partner Paul Drayton in her sprawling garden, and even got ordained so she could be the one to marry them. The flowers alone - thought to have been designed by the Kardashiansâ€™ favourite florist, Jeff Leathamfor - are believed to have cost Â£10,000 alone. But by Christmas 2018, rumours were swirling that her own marriage was on the rocks, with sources claiming she and Simon were living 'separate lives'. His solo appearance at the BRIT Awards that February only set tongues wagging even further.  An insider told The Mirror: ""The Brits were confirmation in a way. Everyone was hoping Adele would come but she stayed away. Things had already broken down for a while."" Friends claimed the couple realised that ""this time they simply were not going to sort it out,"" and that April, their separation was confirmed. It emerged that just a few months prior Adele had signed their marital home over to Simon, and she instead snapped up an Â£8.6million property just across the street. And it's behind the doors of her bachelorette pad that the reeling star is said to have decided to reinvent herself, shedding a massive seven stone through online fitness workouts and sessions with celebrity pilates guru, Camila Goodis. Preferring to work out in the privacy of her own home as opposed to the gym, Adele is believed to have used training videos by The Body Coach Joe Wicks, and trainer Dalton Wong,who also works with Jennifer Lawrence. In her hour of need, her longtime friends and newer showbiz friends including Robbie Williams' wife Ayda Field, James Corden and Emma Stone are said to have been her rock. â€œShe surrounds herself with loyal girlfriends who are as private as she is,"" a source previously said. ""She has the best personality and is very warm and generous.â€ That October, it was claimed Adele also had a new man on the scene in the form of UK grime artist Skepta - real name Joseph Adenuga. ""They have a close bond and thereâ€™s definitely a special connection,"" a source told The Sun of the fellow Londoners. â€œTheyâ€™re spending more and more time together. Some of their friends are hoping and predicting they could end up being a great couple one day.â€ But others later insisted it hadn't proved to be more than a fling. But as Adele turned 31 last May, she opened up about enduring one of the toughest years of her life but assured fans she was moving forward by focusing on herself. â€œThis is 31... Thank f**king god. 30 tried me so hard but Iâ€™m owning it and trying my hardest to lean into it all. 31 is going to be a big olâ€™ year and Iâ€™m going to spend it all on myself. â€œNo matter how long weâ€™re here for, life is constant and complicated at times. Iâ€™ve changed drastically in the last couple of years and Iâ€™m still changing and thatâ€™s OK. â€œBe kind to yourself people weâ€™re only human, go slow, put your phone down and laugh out loud at every opportunity. Learning to really, truly love yourself is it, and Iâ€™ve only just realised that is more than enough.â€ Indeed, she told one group of fans while on holiday in the Caribbean thatÂ  her weight loss journey had been a 'crazy positive experience', and those close to the star claim it has changed her on a personal level. ""Thereâ€™s a lot to do with her weight loss that has really changed her life, but itâ€™s so much more than that. Sheâ€™s had a lot of issues with confidence, self-esteem and a constant fear of being judged,â€ the insider said. â€She isnâ€™t scared of being a single mum, and being happier in herself is making her a better mum. Sheâ€™s really enjoying her time with her son Angelo,â€ they added."
5,Inside celeb self-isolation as stars from Taylor Swift to Lady Gaga go into lockdown,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/coronavirus-inside-celeb-self-isolation-21705729,"Stars from all walks of showbiz from Tom Hanks to Lady Gaga show fans how to self-isolate in the face of the coronavirus crisis Many of the great and the good of the showbiz world have gone into self-isolation. Tom Hanks was one of the first celebrities to go into self-isolation alongside his wife Rita Wilson, both 63, after they were the first celebs to test positive for coronavirus. Now theyâ€™re in self-isolation in a rented home in Australia following treatment for COVID-19 at hospital, a representative has confirmed. Also testing positive and in isolation was actor Idris Elba and London-based Bond girl actress Ogla Kurylenko.  Other stars from all walks of showbiz joined in self-isolation from Susanna Reid, Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga.   Ahead of his hospital visit, Hanks had been updating fans on his condition and his wife from inside their quarantine base.  His latest post was a photograph of a stuffed kangaroo holding an Australian flag as well as two slices of toast smeared with vegemite.  He wrote: â€œThanks to the Helpers. Letâ€™s take care of ourselves and each other. Hanx.â€ Tom had been Down Under to film his latest movie biopic on Elvis Presley and he was accompanied by his wife for the trip on the Gold Coast before being struck by the virus. Elsewhere, Idris has been self-isolating with his wife Sabrina since he found out he had tested positive for the killer bug which has spread across the world in a pandemic. He said in a piece to camera: â€œI feel OK, I have no symptoms so far but have isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. â€œStay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how Iâ€™m doing. No panic.â€ Meanwhile, Taylor treated her fans to a picture of her cat as usual but used the photograph to get across everyone should be self-isolating. The picture showed her cat Meredith snuggled up and sitting comfortable in her pod. She wrote in a message to fans: â€œFor Meredith, self quarantining is a way of life. Be like Meredith.â€ In the same vein, Lady Gaga also has shut off from the world with just her three French bulldogs for company. The Bad Romance hitmaker said the kindest thing she could do was reside at home with her pooches and ride it out. A Star Is Born actress Lady Gaga laid out everyone should be self-quarantining to help with the pandemic sweeping the globe. She wrote: â€œSo I talked to some doctors and scientists. Itâ€™s not the easiest for everyone right now but the kindest/healthiest thing we can do is self-quarantine and not hang out with people over 65 and in large groups. â€œI wish I could see my parents and grandmas right now but itâ€™s much safer to not so I donâ€™t get them sick in case I have it. Iâ€™m hanging at home with my dogs. I love you world, weâ€™ll all get through this. Trust me, I talked to God â€”she said weâ€™re gonna be ok.â€"

Public Health England releases expanded list of those most 'at risk' of catching coronavirus",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-government-release-list-those-21704107,"The government has extended their risk warning to pregnant women for the first time, with a comprehensive list published by Public Health England of people 'at risk' and at 'increased risk' The government has released a full list of those experts consider most at risk from catching and suffering complications with coronavirus. So far 55 people in the UK have died having suffered from Covid-19 that number is expected to increase in the coming days, weeks and months. New public health safety measures put it place today could be in place for 18 months. Previously, advice from the government largely said those who were older, vulnerable and had underlying health conditions were most at risk. Today, they extended their risk warning to pregnant women for the first time. Now, a full list of those classes as more at risk has been issued. They include: The advice went on to say there were some people who were at an even greater risk of ""severe illness"" from COVID-19. People in this category are: The government has advice here on how anyone with concerns who may be at risk should socially distance themselves - and how they can manage while in isolation Boris Johnson announced that those in vulnerable groups - including all those over 70 - would be asked to avoid contact by isolating except in very specific circumstances. Mr Johnson added: ""This advice about avoiding all social contact is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions."" It could mean avoiding social contact for 12 weeks, with entire households now being asked to self-isolate for 14 days if just one member has symptoms. Public Health England chief medical officer Chris Whitty described the new guidance for those more at risk as ""absolutely critical"". Prof Whitty said: ""The group of people who we would want to take this advice particularly seriously are older people above 70, people who in adult life would normally be advised to have the flu vaccination. The latest announcement came shortly before figures confirmed 55 people have now died - a jump of 20 cases in 24 hours. ""So these are people with chronic diseases such as chronic heart disease or chronic kidney disease, and also - as a precautionary measure because we are early in our understanding and we want to be sure - women who are pregnant."" Anyone with a high temperature or a new and continuous cough or anyone in their household with those symptoms should stay at home, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced."
12,Mick Jagger's wedding bodyguard shares incredible tales of adventures with stars,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/mick-jaggers-wedding-bodyguard-shares-21704366,"Daily Mirror showbusiness legend Don Short is dishing all on his adventures with some of the world's biggest stars in his new book The Beatles And Beyond We told earlier how Daily Mirror showbusiness legend Don Short could have been the Fifth Beatle, he was so close to John, Paul, George and Ringo. But he was also a confidant of many other superstars of the 1960s and 1970s. Here, in the second part of our exclusive serialisation of his new memoir The Beatles And Beyond, Don remembers his day as wedding bodyguard to Mick Jagger, a naked proposal from Helen Mirren and boozing with clean-cut Cliff Richard... * Extracted from The Beatles And Beyond, by Don Short, Wymer Publishing, Â£14.99, available at wymeruk.co.uk  Out of the blue, Mick announced he was going to marry Nicaraguan diplomatâ€™s daughter Bianca Perez Moreno de Macias, who he had met in France in September 1970. But then came a surprise twist.  It came as a request from Rolling Stones publicist Les Perrin. Would I agree to be the bridal coupleâ€™s bodyguard throughout the nuptials in Saint-Tropez? I did not have to think twice but fear of the expected furore the wedding would cause clearly meant we needed a second bodyguard, and my colleague Patrick Doncaster agreed to play the role with me. The big day â€“ May 12, 1971 â€“ arrived. Just one glance at the baying fans and invading paparazzi outside the town hall where the ceremony was to be conducted made us realise that Perrin had not underestimated the commotion. The mayor threatened to call the whole ceremony off, such was the tumult. Mick, in his best suit, and Bianca, in an Yves St Laurent white jacket and a long skirt, left it to Perrin to talk the mayor round into allowing the ceremony to go ahead. Risking all and sundry against the huge tide of fans and cameramen, we managed to guide Mick and Bianca through to the hall. Trouble and tempers again escalated when the couple emerged as man and wife. The crowd went ballistic. We placed ourselves either side of the hemmed-in couple now marauded by the flash-popping paparazzi, rival journalists and hysterical fans. Punches were exchanged. Patrick was elbowed and almost bowled over. My own battered frame was savaged relentlessly but inch by inch, we achieved our aim to get the couple into the waiting limousine to make their escape.  Photos of our struggle on the town  hall steps became iconic â€” pictures in which we figured in the full thralls of our bodyguard duties.  Not long after his marriage to Bianca, Mick was assuring me that he was going to quit the scene when he reached the age of 33. â€œAfter that I will find something else to do. I couldnâ€™t bear to end up as Elvis Presley and sing in Las Vegas with all those old ladies coming in with their handbags. Not me.â€ He must have had a change of heart. Unlike Cliff, popâ€™s anti-hero, David Bowie, indulged in everything â€“ cocaine, acid, pot, torrid relationships and band bust-ups. As Ziggy Stardust, he also experimented with gender and sexuality, and throughout his career he alternately stated he was heterosexual, gay and bisexual. When, unannounced, I visited the 24-year-old Bowie at his Beckenham home in the spring of 1971, he opened the front door wearing a dress. His wife Angie, only two weeks away from having their first baby, was thrilled by the way her husband looked. â€œI rather fancy him that way. He looks so lovely in a dress,â€ she said. They both invited me in to stay for lunch. Bowieâ€™s shoulder-length blond hair hung over the flowing pink and blue dress which he wore with knee-length calf boots. David said he liked the dress so much, heâ€™d ordered six more at Â£150 a pop. When the role of James Bond fell vacant in 1972, Roger Moore was the clear choice to follow Sean Connery as 007. After he completed his first Bond film, Live and Let Die, Roger suggested I join him in Thailand, where he was taking on his second 007 blockbuster, The Man With The Golden Gun, with Swedish actress Britt Ekland. One evening Britt (the former wife of Peter Sellers) dined with me in Bangkok. We ordered our food but she insisted it should not be cooked in garlic. She said: â€œI couldnâ€™t do that to Roger. Thatâ€™s how Diana Rigg fell out with George Lazenby when he played Bond in On His Majestyâ€™s Service. Diana kept upsetting him by eating garlicâ€¦â€ There are times in life when we all do foolish things. None more so on my part than when notorious star Oliver Reed duped me into accepting his challenge to a drinking contest. In readiness for my arrival, two bottles of brandy were on the table in Ollieâ€™s hotel suite in Madrid, where he was filming 1973â€™s The Three Musketeers. I wanted to talk to him about the film but he shook his head, insisting we all loosen up before we got to it. Then he threw down the gauntlet... â€œThereâ€™s a bottle of brandy for you and one for me. First one to finish wins,â€ he said. I tried to abstain but Ollie refused to listen. He opened the bottle, pushed it closer to me and filled a glass to the brim. â€œRight, away we go,â€ he stormed, demolishing his first glass in one gulp. I picked up my own glass and sipped it tentatively. One hour later, just as Ollie looked as though he was going to be the clear winner, he slumped back on the couch, appearing completely inebriated. His friend smiled: â€œThat was Ollieâ€™s second bottle of the day. He drank a bottle of brandy before you arrived!â€ During his heady days as a serial chart-topper, there was one memorable lunch with clean-cut pop idol Cliff Richard when he drank two Bloody Marys and a half-bottle of hock â€“ which, at the time, struck me as being slightly at odds with his personality. But as we left the smart West End restaurant, Cliff had an answer for it... He declared: â€œThe greatest Christian that ever lived was a sinner.â€ Cliff hasnâ€™t ever pretended to be an exception. The 26-year-old Royal Shakespeare Company actress had begun her film career but was finding the nude scenes difficult. Helen had an idea she wanted to put to Equity, the actorsâ€™ union, that when an actress filmed a nude scene, everyone in the studio should strip. She told me over lunch in London: â€œWhy should the producer, director and whole crew get away with it? People are sensitive about their naked bodies. They think of their ugly features first.â€ She asked me: â€œHow would you feel if you had to strip in front of 40 fully-clothed women?â€ In South Africa in 1977, during The Wild Geese filming, I ended up in a bar with two bull-necked Afrikaans security guards. The conversation turned heated and in my cups I criticised the apartheid system. Walking back to my bungalow just before midnight, a car screeched to a halt behind me and a large, burly figure knocked me unconscious. I woke under a clear blue sky concussed and dazed. They had dumped me in the wild. I roused to my feet, started to run in sheer fright. I was at a point of exhaustion when I spotted the tiny airstrip where our little plane had landed. I tried to explain my ordeal to a tribesmen by an outbuilding. He shook his head and said, â€œYou are lucky to be alive.â€"

The Spaniard, 32, who now resides in Monaco, took to his plush balcony to greet nearby residents via a famous line from one of his favourite films.  In the video posted on his Instagram account, Fabregas can be seen striding out on to the balcony overlooking columns of hotels and apartments.  A dock with some small boats and a few larger yachts can be seen in the background of the shot. Fabregas walks out, throws both arms up into the air and the 32-year-old then appears to shout: ""Good morning my neighbours!"" An imaginary resident shouts: ""Hey, f*** you!"" as it becomes clear that the audio has in fact been dubbed over the top of the video. Fabregas appears to reply: ""Yes, yes! F*** you too!"" before he moves away from the balcony. The line was made famous by John Landis' Coming to America, released in 1988. The line is spoken by Eddie Murphy, who plays the character of Prince Akeem. Footballers have been doing all they can to entertain themselves after the sporting calendar came to an abrupt halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some have been taking part in the challenge that has been widely shared on the internet involving playing keepy-uppy with a roll of toilet paper. Current Chelsea playmaker Mason Mount, meanwhile, came under fire over the weekend after it emerged he had left self-isolation to enjoy a knockabout with England colleague Declan Rice. The Blues man was subject to the measures after club colleague Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for COVID-19, and was later reminded of his responsibilities by his club after leaving his home to meet up with West Ham's Rice."

16,"Scrap or change VAR, which is robbing football of iconic moments, say MPs",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/scrap-change-var-robbing-football-21708598,"Labour's Toby Perkins led a Westminster Hall debate on axing the controversial technology which he warns is ruining the sport The controversy over VAR reached Parliament today as MPs called for the system to be axed or overhauled. Labour MP Toby Perkins demanded the video assistant referee be scrapped from the sport.  It was introduced to the Premier League at the start of this season, which has been suspended amid the coronavirus crisis. But high-profile matches have been marred by controversial decisions â€“ and outraged fans have chanted â€œF*** VARâ€ in frustration. Leading a Westminster Hall debate, former Shadow Minister Mr Perkism said there was â€œalmost universal agreement that the way VAR is currently being used in the EPL is bad for footballâ€. Soccer is â€œthe most successful, richest, most widely watched and played sport in the history of our planetâ€ because of its â€œsimplicity and its accessibilityâ€, he said. Blasting the â€œsoulless VAR experimentâ€ was â€œrobbingâ€ fans and players of the joy of celebrating goals, Mr Perkins told MPs. â€œA goal can be a thing of beauty - a thrilling movement that builds to a crescendo, with a truly thrilling release; or it can be workmanlike, it can be brutal, the ball forced over the line. It can be fortunate, freakish or amazingly simple, sometimes even comical and farcical,â€ he said. â€œIt can be controversial, a moment to delight and bring a nation together in a shared explosion of joy; or it can be tragic, as an entire ground, indeed a nation, clasps their head in their hands in perfect union. â€œThere is no other moment in any other sport so special as the moment in football in which a goal is scored. â€œBut however the goal is scored, it is rare and it is important - and because of its rarity and its importance, it matters and it is celebrated. â€œAnd it is this, the very fundamental ethos of what it means to love football, that is the moment that VAR chooses to besmirch â€“ that moment of simple joy or simple despair that is robbed by a faceless man sat on an industrial estate in South West London, sat miles away from those who really care as all they can do is wait for his dreadful and often imperfect verdict.â€ Mr Perkins wanted VAR abolished, but called for changes to the offside rule if football chiefs insist on keeping it. He said a goal should not be ruled out for offside if â€œone playerâ€™s toe is a millimetre beyond another playerâ€™sâ€.  The MP for Chesterfeld, Derbs, added: â€œThis is not what the offside rule was designed to outlaw and it needs rewriting, to return to the original principle that if the majority of two players' bodies are basically level then the striker he is considered to be onside.â€  Fans in stadiums to be able to see replays, to reduce the mystery around for decisions for paying supports,â€ said Mr Perkins.  And he called for on-field referees to view goals and build-ups so they could decide whether they made a â€œclear and obvious errorâ€ with their original decision. Scottish National Party spokesman David Linden said reviews took too long when â€œfans were sitting trying to work out what on earth has gone onâ€. â€œIt's perhaps for that reason that so many fans are chanting, 'It's not football anymore' in the stands,â€ he said. â€œThis microscopic analysis is killing the game.â€  But SNP MP Brendan O'Hara branded critics â€œfootballing ludditesâ€, saying decisions had to be correct because they â€œcan cost millions of poundsâ€ and clubs' futures can be â€œmapped outâ€ by right or wrong calls.  He added: â€œIt's not that VAR is wrong in and of itself, but it's the implementation of VAR that should be improved rather than chucking the whole experiment outâ€. Shadow Culture Secretary Tracy Brabin claimed VAR was a â€œscourgeâ€, harming â€œthose iconic moments in football when the ball ripples to the back of the net, terraces eruptâ€. She said: â€œThey have all too often been lost this season, replaced with anxious faces watching the screen to see if the goal has gone to be checked.â€ Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said it was up to the Premier League and clubs to decide on VAR and any changes. He added: â€œI may have a view on this but I am afraid I have no such control.â€ Attendances at top-flight grounds were running at 97.5%, he said. â€œThe Premier League continues to deliver a fantastic experience and the introduction of VAR doesn't seem to have hampered attendances,â€ said Mr Huddleston."
17,Coronavirus: Pregnant women now part of most 'at risk' group says Boris Johnson,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-coronavirus-pregnant-women-told-21703027,"Boris Johnson announced that those in vulnerable groups - including all those over 70 - would be asked to avoid contact by isolating except in very specific circumstances Pregnant women will be told to stay at home for 12 weeks after being added to the 'at risk' list in new coronavirus guidance issued by the government. It is the first time the government have officially grouped pregnant women with the elderly and more vulnerable. Public Health England chief medical officer Chris Whitty described the new guidance for those more at risk as ""absolutely critical"". The latest announcement came shortly before figures confirmed 55 people have now died - a jump of 20 cases in 24 hours.   Boris Johnson announced that those in vulnerable groups - including all those over 70 - would be asked to avoid contact by isolating except in very specific circumstances. Mr Johnson added: ""This advice about avoiding all social contact is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions."" It could mean avoiding social contact for 12 weeks, with entire households now being asked to self-isolate for 14 days if just one member has symptoms. Prof Whitty said: ""The group of people who we would want to take this advice particularly seriously are older people above 70, people who in adult life would normally be advised to have the flu vaccination. ""So these are people with chronic diseases such as chronic heart disease or chronic kidney disease, and also - as a precautionary measure because we are early in our understanding and we want to be sure - women who are pregnant."" Anyone with a high temperature or a new and continuous cough or anyone in their household with those symptoms should stay at home, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. Affected people should only go out to exercise at a safe distance form others and not even leave the house for food. The NHS has stopped advising coronavirus patients to take ibuprofen amid concerns the anti-inflammatory painkiller could only make things worse. A statement read: ""There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (COVID-19) worse. ""But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you. ""If you are already taking ibuprofen or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) on the advice of a doctor, do not stop taking it without checking first."" The Prime Minister said all non-essential travel and contact with others must stop, asking everyone in the UK to work from home if possible and avoid all pubs, clubs and other social gatherings. Asked about whether curfews and criminal sanctions are on the cards as wider social distancing measures are announced, Boris Johnson has said it is unlikely - but added that all measures are under review. The Prime Minster said the UK already has extensive powers to deal with potential breaches of orders. He has told a press conference: â€œmost people would accept we are already a mature and liberal democracy where people understand very clearly the advice that is being given to them.â€ Earlier the World Health Organisation urged all countries to stick to containment strategies, saying the pandemic is controllable. Director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned people with Covid-19 can still infect others after they stop feeling sick. He recommended that when sick people were being cared for at home, both patient and caregiver should wear a mask when together, and the infected person should sleep in a different room. He added: â€œPeople infected with Covid-19 can still infect others after they stop feeling sick, so these measures should continue for at least two weeks after symptoms disappear.â€"

0,British Airways  Airline in fight for survival as industry faces crisis 'worse than 9/11' ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/ba-says-jobs-will-go-as-airline-industry-faces-crisis-worse-than-9-11-coronavirus,"British Airways has warned staff it is in a fight for survival and expects to make job cuts and ground an unprecedented number of planes, as it said the coronavirus pandemic has caused a crisis â€œworse than 9/11â€ for the airline industry. BAâ€™s chief executive, Alex Cruz, said in a message to 45,000 employees entitled â€œThe Survival of British Airwaysâ€ that the airline would be â€œparking aircraft in a way we never have beforeâ€ after the drop in demand was compounded by the shock US travel ban from Europe announced on Wednesday night. It came as the German media reported that the countryâ€™s flagship carrier, Lufthansa, might ground most of its fleet and ask for state aid in the wake of Donald Trumpâ€™s surprise move. Although BA and UK visitors were exempted from the US ban, about a quarter of passengers from Heathrow are in transit from countries in the Schengen passport-free zone and the move will have further deterred potential travellers on BAâ€™s most lucrative transatlantic routes. Cruz told BAâ€™s staff that coronavirus was â€œa crisis of global proportions like no other we have knownâ€, in the messageâ€“ seen by the Reuters. He warned staff that layoffs were coming, â€œperhaps for a short period, perhaps longer termâ€. The company is in discussions with trade unions to shore up its cash position and try to protect jobs. He added: â€œPlease do not underestimate the seriousness of this for our company.â€ BAâ€™s is part of International Airlines Group (IAG) and its main sister carrier, Iberia, has been directly affected by the US travel ban. Madrid, where Iberia is based, is the focus of a major Covid-19 outbreak and on Friday the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to the Spanish capital. BA has already cut hundreds of flights from its winter schedule, mainly to Europe, although it has yet to confirm what further flights will be axed in coming weeks. Airlines have already amended booking terms and conditions to allow passengers to book with more confidence, with easyJet going as far as allowing customers to rebook to any destination without charge, up to the day of travel. Lufthansa, which is the European airline with the most flights directly affected by the US ban, is to ask the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to intervene, according to reports in the Handelsblatt newspaper. Lufthansa is said to be considering a range of options to deal with the crisis, including the temporary suspension of most flights across its network. Air France-KLM are continuing to operate some flights to the US and have yet to confirm what further measures they are taking. Even before the Trump ban, the International Air Transport Association had warned that passenger airlines could lose up to $113bn (Â£87bn) in revenues this year. In the UK, where the regional carrier Flybe collapsed after the outbreak of coronavirus, fears that the wider aviation industry could follow have been raised further, with news of job cuts at Edinburgh Airport. The Unite trade union warned that Edinburgh, following Southampton airport, was on the brink of collapse without government help. Norwegian is in talks with its government for urgent aid to ensure its survival. The Oslo government slashed air taxes on Friday but the airline said it was not enough. Its chief executive, Jacob Schram, said: â€œWe need exact measures to strengthen our liquidity in the short term immediately.â€ The airline, which operates long-haul, low-cost transatlantic flights, on Thursday announced it would be laying off up to half of its staff during the crisis. It has also cut about 4,000 flights."
2,'We're really fed up'  Britons on life in coronavirus hotspots ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/really-fed-up-britons-life-coronavirus-hotspots-china-italy,"While the spread of coronavirus in the UK is in its early stages, Britons around the world have been living with the impact of the virus for some time. In Hangzhou in China, just a few hundred miles from Wuhan, the city where the outbreak started life has slowly been returning to normal for Gav Munro, an artist, and his wife, Juliet, after being isolated at home for five weeks. â€œWe were under self-quarantine at the end of January but by February it had become mandatory and we were restricted to one person per household being allowed out every four days,â€ said the 47-year-old. â€œOn the first night of quarantine, I went for a ride on an electric bike and it was so quiet. That was when I knew it was serious.â€ China has been dealing with the crisis since the beginning of the year. A month ago, the worst affected area, Hubei province, was reporting several thousand new cases a day. On Wednesday there were only eight new infections, the first time the province has recorded a daily tally in single-digits. â€œDuring our time in quarantine I went for walks in the communal garden in the apartment complex,â€ said Munro, who has lived in China for 13 years. â€œI didnâ€™t feel like there was an environment of fear as people werenâ€™t really panicking. Youâ€™d go to the shops and people would help each other out.â€ On 14 February the couple were given a â€œfree passâ€ to leave whenever they wanted. When outside, Munro has been using an app called Alipay Health Code to make sure he does not walk into areas where there may be confirmed cases. The app, which has been criticised for appearing to share private information with the police, gives users a red, yellow or green QR code depending on the status of their health. Munro has found it helpful. â€œItâ€™s amazing,â€ he said. â€œA green code, which I have, means I can go about as normal. A yellow code means someone may be quarantined for seven days, and a red code means 14 days. You have to show the code in every store you go to, but it reassures me that Iâ€™m in a safe area. â€œThe city is slowly getting back to normal and everyone I know is desperate to get back to work.â€ The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agencyÂ advisesÂ people to: Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit â€“ but not eliminate â€“ the risks, provided it is used correctly. Justin McCurry Despite spending more than a month indoors, John Williamson and his wife, Vivi, were in self-quarantine for the second time in Liuzhou in southern China, where there have been a few hundred cases in the province. â€œWe stayed with Viviâ€™s parents in Nanning over 100 miles away after the Chinese new year holiday and didnâ€™t leave for more than 30 days,â€ he said. â€œIt wasnâ€™t mandatory but travel wasnâ€™t recommended at the time. When we arrived back home we decided to self-quarantine again just in case.â€ John, 59, and Vivi, 40, finished their second self-quarantine on Thursday. â€œWe probably wonâ€™t go anywhere beyond the local supermarket and if we do go out, we of course will be wearing masks.â€ John, who teaches English at Guangxi University of Science and Technology, said things had been very different since the virus hit. â€œBefore there were no barriers anywhere,â€ he said. â€œNow there are metal fences all over and access to our building is restricted to only one entrance. â€œAt first I thought the measures were overkill but I think we have the problem relatively under control now. Itâ€™s not that bad but it feels like I havenâ€™t been out for so long. At least when we wanted something we could have it delivered. You could even get coffee from Starbucks.â€ In South Korea, which is now the fourth-most-affected country after China with 7,869 cases, thereâ€™s hope that the country is approaching a turning point. In North Gyeongsang province, near the centre of the countryâ€™s outbreak in Daegu, Amanda*, 25, an English teacher, said many events in April had been cancelled. â€œThere are signs everywhere reminding us to wear masks, wash our hands and use sanitisers,â€ she said. â€œThere are even some places, like pharmacies, where you cannot enter without wearing a mask. Buying them is also limited to two per person to ensure thereâ€™s enough for everyone.â€ Amanda stays across new developments through government alerts on her phone. â€œThey update me on the number of confirmed cases, which regions theyâ€™re in, which hospitals patients are in as well as hygiene prevention measures we should follow,â€ she said. â€œThey also tell us the public transport routes patients have taken so we know which ones to avoid. I personally feel the authorities are really taking this seriously. â€œSchools are closed and the return date has been consistently pushed back â€“ it was 2 March and now itâ€™s the 23rd. I think it will get a bit better but weâ€™re not out of the woods yet.â€ One hundred miles north in Seongnam, despite some businesses closing early in the evening, Emily Barton, 28, and her husband said they felt relatively safe. â€œOver two weeks ago it was much busier outside but people are more wary now of giving each other space,â€ said Barton, who works as a teacher at an international school. â€œWeâ€™ve been avoiding public transport and large gatherings but everyone is being so careful. â€œA drive-through testing facility has been set up to make it easier for people to remain isolated. You drive up, they test you, you get given some snacks and wait in your car for the results. Itâ€™s very efficient.â€ â€œAs a married couple in our late 20s itâ€™s difficult not having much to do. Itâ€™s not just boredom, but worry and monotony. Iâ€™m concerned about how long schools will be closed for,â€ she said. â€œI work at a small private school and with parents not paying fees because students are not attending, thereâ€™s a risk of it having a knock-on effect on teachersâ€™ wages.â€ Steve Good, across the Sea of Japan in Kushiro, Hokkaido, wants his two children to go back to school, after they closed at the end of February. â€œWe canâ€™t work as much as we want,â€ said the 51-year-old teacher, who has lived in the country for more than 20 years. â€œTheir books are still at school so we donâ€™t really know what to do, but we donâ€™t want to waste the time we have.â€ After a state of emergency was declared in the prefecture at the end of February, residents were asked to remain at home for a few days. â€œUnlike lockdowns in other countries we were asked nicely not to go out, rather than told not to. This might be because people in Hokkaido are used to crises like earthquakes and tsunamis. Thereâ€™s no panic, just a strange energy â€“ itâ€™s weird,â€ he said. â€œToilet paper and rice are the main things you canâ€™t seem to buy. Weâ€™ve been in self-quarantine for nearly two weeks but thereâ€™s only so much you can do. I think it will all blow over in a couple of weeks but weâ€™ve already got cabin fever.â€ Japan has closed schools until April. The country had one of the largest outbreaks outside China in February, when the Diamond Princess cruise ship was docked in Yokohama. At the end of February more than 600 passengers tested positive. It has now dropped in the table of global infections to 15th place with 639 cases. As Covid-19 spreads in Europe, Italy has become the deadliest site for the virus outside China with over 1,000 deaths and more than 15,000 infected. The entire country is on lockdown â€“ all shops, bars and restaurants are closed, and schools and universities are not due to open again until April. Lauren Doling, 49, who works as a teacher and lives in Rosate, one hour from the centre of the outbreak in Codogno, said she felt isolated now that she could not leave Lombardy. â€œI canâ€™t use the Metro to move around any more so Iâ€™m at home a lot more now, when I would have been out for up to 13 hours a day,â€ she said. â€œThereâ€™s quite a bit of paranoia going around and itâ€™s quite eerie. â€œBars were open in the evening last week, where you would wait for someone to come and serve you at a table, but now everythingâ€™s closed,â€ said Doling ,who has lived in Italy for 19 years. â€œThere are empty shelves in the supermarket. Iâ€™m vegan so it doesnâ€™t really affect me, but thereâ€™s no meat and milk.â€ Doling has prepared online lessons for her students. â€œWeâ€™re teaching them using a new platform which has been an interesting challenge. Iâ€™m feeling frustrated our regular lives have had to be put on hold for the time being, though. Itâ€™s as if everything is on standby.â€ Near Dolo in the Venice province, Jodie, 42, has been trying to keep her eight-year-old son occupied during their third week indoors. â€œWeâ€™re just at home doing nothing,â€ she said. â€œWe have YouTube and Fortnite, but he probably shouldnâ€™t be playing that.â€ â€œThree weeks ago our WhatsApp group for parents went crazy with panicked messages about schools being closed,â€ added Jodie, who works as a PA. â€œWe didnâ€™t think we would have to self-quarantine but then we couldnâ€™t get hold of any hand wipes, soap and face masks. Hand gel is now back in stock though which is a good sign.â€ â€œFor every little town in Italy thereâ€™s a mayor, and ours happens to also be the local doctor â€“ sheâ€™s been very good at keeping us up to date on Facebook. Weâ€™re just waiting for it to end now. Weâ€™re fed up, really.â€ Some names have been changed."
4,The hellish side of handwashing  How coronavirus is affecting people with OCD ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/13/why-regular-handwashing-can-be-bad-advice-for-patients,"Boris Johnson does it while singing Happy Birthday twice. For Jacob Rees-Mogg, itâ€™s the national anthem. And as soap supplies run low, it seems much of Britain is following their example and heeding the official guidance to wash hands thoroughly and often, in order to minimise the spread of the coronavirus. It is good public health advice, of course. Indeed, one question raised by the rush for soap is just what all those people without any in the house did before. But for some people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), to be warned they must scrub to protect themselves from an invisible enemy, and to do so in a ritualistic way with internal musical accompaniment, is akin to inviting a demon to come for tea. Some of these people have spent years trying not to wash their hands, often as a prescribed part of their treatment. â€œItâ€™s definitely put a lot of the internal OCD dialogue back into my life. Itâ€™s being reinforced by outside, authoritative voices,â€ says Erica (not her real name), a long-term OCD patient. â€œItâ€™s a lot harder to tell yourself that the urge to wash your hands is irrational when everyone on your Twitter feed or on the news is saying: â€˜Wash your hands. Nobody is washing their hands correctly.â€™â€ The worsening outbreak affects people with OCD in other ways, too. Chiefly, the spike in anxiety about the virus can fuel existing obsessive fears of contamination and trigger destructive compulsive actions. For some people with OCD, coronavirus can become all they think about. â€œI have seen three patients this week whose OCD has started to focus on coronavirus,â€ says David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the Priory hospital in London. â€œIt is a challenging time for people who have OCD.â€ As anyone with the condition will know, of course, OCD is challenging all the time. Often portrayed as a behavioural quirk, OCD is in fact a syndrome defined by recurring irrational thoughts. The compulsive actions â€“ often the most visible feature of the illness â€“ are usually only a response to those intrusive thoughts. The irrational content of those thoughts is limited only by the spectrum of human imagination. Since I published a book on my experiences with OCD, I have met people obsessed with the idea that if they close their eyes, the whole world will change while they are not looking, or that if they hand-write a letter or a number that contains a closed loop, their family will die. But OCD does tend to cluster around a limited number of themes. Perhaps the biggest of these is contamination â€“ with generic dirt or germs, or with a specific illness or disease. And these contamination fears are heavily influenced by culture, society and shared health scares. Coronavirus is only the latest. I have OCD that focuses on HIV and Aids, which makes sense because I grew up in the 1980s when global fear of that condition was at its peak. It wasnâ€™t just me. A generation was traumatised. The US psychiatrist Judith Rapoport wrote in her book, The Boy Who Couldnâ€™t Stop Washing, that by 1989 a third of her OCD patients focused on HIV and Aids. The disease, she wrote, appeared â€œso terrifying, so irrational that it could have been the creation of an obsessive-compulsiveâ€™s worst fantasyâ€. In the 1920s, doctors in the US reported a surge in what they called syphilis-phobia, which coincided with a campaign to highlight the dangers of the disease. In the 1960s and 70s there was a spike in irrational fears of asbestos, just as the dangers of the material had come to popular attention. In 2012, Australian scientists reported the first cases of OCD in people who fixate on thoughts about climate change â€“ a bogeyman for the new millennium and one that, like HIV in the 1980s, poses an uncertain, universal threat, depicted in lurid detail by the mass media. (Full disclosure: as the former environment correspondent for this newspaper, I used to write those stories.) If coronavirus continues to spread, experts expect related cases of OCD to spike as well. The disease and the attention it is receiving are â€œgood for businessâ€, one psychiatrist told me with gallows humour. Exactly what makes some people predisposed to OCD isnâ€™t clear, but genetics and previous experiences seem to play a role. In some cases, Veale says, the coronavirus threat could bring on OCD for the first time. â€œIf someoneâ€™s got the right genes and theyâ€™ve had all the right experiences to shape them, then this could be a trigger to set the whole thing off.â€ There is some evidence that simply asking people to wash their hands can make them more anxious about their health. Psychologists have found that students asked to spend a week using hand sanitiser after they touched money, door handles or other possible sources of germs subsequently reported significantly higher signs of hypochondria. For Kyle MacNeill, a freelance writer, the 2009 swine flu scare initiated a years-long struggle with OCD. He traces it back to a remark from a family member that he wasnâ€™t washing his hands properly. Combined with the warnings about the virus, the comment sparked an obsession with germs. â€œIâ€™d wash my hands 20 times in a row,â€ he says. â€œOn my way out I would accidentally brush against the door handle. Itâ€™s very exhausting, you know, having to repeat that process again.â€ MacNeillâ€™s anxieties were eventually successfully treated and he is not overly worried that coronavirus will set them off again. What about people who do worry they might convert rational coronavirus anxiety to OCD? What should they look out for? Veale says the signs of OCD are clear and different from the â€œnormalâ€ response to the coronavirus. Fretting about the virus and washing hands a lot donâ€™t qualify on their own. An important difference is that someone with OCD will wash until they feel comfortable or â€œjust rightâ€. â€œThe key issue is the function,â€ he says. â€œIs it to reduce the risk of spreading of coronavirus, or is it done ritualistically in a specific order with termination criteria?â€ The content of the thoughts and the nature of the anxiety are usually different, too. With OCD, the intrusive thoughts are exaggerated and irrational. One of Vealeâ€™s patients with coronavirus OCD, for example, has started to fixate on whether they can catch the disease from Chinese food. It is important to stress that, as long as it is not excessive, handwashing to minimise the risk of coronavirus spread from other people is a rational response to a genuine threat. But OCD just isnâ€™t rational. Although many patients with OCD do wash their hands repeatedly, it is not always because they think they are dirty. In some cases, it is just a way to find comfort, to ease the mental burden of irrational obsessions that a loved one might die, or that something dreadful will happen to them. For some OCD patients, flicking a light on and off a set number of times can bring that relief. So can tapping, or saying a specific word, or shuffling from foot to foot or an infinite number of other nonsensical routines. For me it was seeking reassurance: checking for blood on a piece of glass I stepped on, or asking health professionals if I could catch HIV by doing this and that. In every case, I already knew the answer was no. But I wanted them to say it because for a second or two I believed and the world seemed a brighter place. The reassurance never lasted but it gave me a hit of happiness that became addictive. That is why OCD is so hard to treat, and why coronavirus and official advice on handwashing pose such a dilemma for some OCD patients and therapists. Treatment for OCD is based on the principle of exposure-and-response prevention. It exposes a patient to what they are afraid of, to spike their anxiety, but stops them performing the compulsive acts they would usually employ to make themselves feel better. For contamination-related OCD, that response prevention frequently involves getting them to not wash their hands, sometimes for days on end. In theory, the anxiety drips away and the patient realises they need not rely on handwashing to feel better. Being told they do need to repeatedly wash their hands after all could interfere with that recovery. It is a paradox and one that makes health officials jumpy. I spoke with one NHS psychiatrist who wanted to make the point that OCD patients with handwashing issues should follow the government advice on coronavirus, but not take it too far. They were told by their bosses that they shouldnâ€™t say so publicly because: â€œIt may be a very risky strategy, including if a patient actually does catch the virus.â€ For some OCD patients, the risky strategy is the correct one, says Jon Abramowitz, an OCD expert and therapist at the University of North Carolina. He is telling some OCD patients to ignore the official US government health advice on coronavirus and to keep on not washing their hands. â€œItâ€™s a tough call. What I have said to people is that your risk is low and I donâ€™t think you need to take all these kinds of precautions. And given you have OCD, youâ€™re probably better off not.â€  David Adam is the author of The Man Who Couldnâ€™t Stop: The Truth About OCD."
5,Social distancing  Is it risky to go to the pub or gym? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-is-it-risky-to-go-to-the-pub-or-gym,"The UK government has not placed any restrictions on social gatherings or travel within the UK and has not advised people without symptoms to isolate themselves to curb the coronavirus outbreak. However, some experts say that â€œsocial distancingâ€ can play a role. So which weekend activities are most risky? Elderly people and those with conditions that affect the immune and respiratory systems are by far the most vulnerable to Covid-19. In Italy, the over-80s have a mortality rate of about 20%, based on available data â€“ although this figure may be inflated by hospitals being overwhelmed with patients. So is visiting a good idea? â€œIf you have frail, elderly relatives, no, I really donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a good idea,â€ said Prof Francois Balloux, chair in computational systems biology at University College London. â€œI would not visit elderly, frail relatives at the moment.â€ Ballouxâ€™s view is informed by growing evidence that people with Covid-19 may be at their most infectious before they start to feel unwell. So self-isolating once you have a fever or cough is not enough to ensure these vulnerable groups are protected. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he would not stop visiting elderly relatives yet, but that it was worth rethinking participating in certain activities. â€œIf I was older than I am now - Iâ€™m 63 - and in a particularly vulnerable group I would not currently go into a busy restaurant or pub or on the trains,â€ he said. â€œI would be starting to avoid those sorts of settings at the moment. For me it would be a gradual thing.â€ Should people be considering a night at home instead of a few jars down the local? â€œI donâ€™t think weâ€™re quite at that point yet,â€ said Hunter. However, he said people should think about reducing physical contact. â€œIâ€™ve stopped shaking hands, not because I think itâ€™s essential at the moment but because I want to get into the habit of doing it and I do currently try and stand a bit further away than I would have done,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s like when you change your computer password, for the first month youâ€™re forever writing in the old one. We should be getting into the habit of doing these things sooner rather than later.â€ â€œIâ€™d still go to the pub,â€ said Balloux. â€œIâ€™m not sure I should, but I would.â€ He is more sceptical about the effectiveness of cutting physical contact. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of focus on indirect transmission, but to be honest we have no clue about indirect versus direct transmission,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s a guess, but from the biology youâ€™re very likely to catch it through the air without actually touching anything.â€ One of the few positives in this outbreak is that children have barely been affected â€“ in China, less than 1% of confirmed cases were children under nine and none of Italyâ€™s more that 1,000 deaths were children. So children and babies are not likely to suffer severe symptoms. Also, there is no evidence that the virus can live in chlorinated water. â€œItâ€™s true that when youâ€™re swimming, water is swirling in and out of your nose and mouth, but this is a respiratory virus. The current thinking appears to be that Sars-Cov-2 wonâ€™t survive if water is properly chlorinated,â€ said Jenny Rohn, a cell biologist at University College London. Changing rooms also have a degree of built-in social distancing, with people separated into cubicles or at least leaving a decent amount of room for others to get changed. â€œSwimming is one of the things I feel quite comfortable with at the moment,â€ said Rohn. Premier League football is off the agenda for this weekend. But what are the risks associated with large public gatherings? Experts say the absolute numbers are not what matters here â€“ a stadium might hold tens of thousands of spectators, but you will probably only be sat in close proximity to a handful. â€œThe real question around whether to ban big events is not about the risk to you as an individual,â€ said Hunter. â€œItâ€™s the potential for the spread more globally. If youâ€™ve got people travelling down from Scotland and taking trains to matches, its disseminating the infection around the country rather than the the risk to the individual.â€ Looked at purely from the perspective of individual risk, however, Hunter said there was not a strong argument for avoiding such events. For many people, exercise is extremely important, both physically and psychologically, and not something that can be easily sacrificed. Most viruses are transmitted more easily in indoor environments so one possibility would be exchanging indoor training for an exercise session or run in the park. If you visit the gym, there are additional hygiene measures you can take to reduce the chances of transmission. â€œI would probably be sanitising the handles on a cross trainer with a wipe or some hand gel rather than just using a towel,â€ said Rohn. There are currently no travel restrictions in the UK, so how you travel and where you go is something that people are having to decide for themselves. Public transport can be hotspots for the spread of disease as they bring strangers into close contact for extended time periods. â€œTrains are enclosed spaces, there are a lot of people sneezing and coughing, the London Underground is quite an incubator,â€ said Rohn.  One option for some may be to consider other forms of transport such as walking or cycling. And people will also need to weigh up their own personal risk based on age and whether they are particularly likely to suffer serious symptoms. â€œIf you are in the older age bracket there are a lot more things besides cruises that are quite dangerous for you,â€ said Rohn."
0,Exclusive  UK coronavirus crisis 'to last until spring 2021 and could see 7.9m hospitalised' ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised,"The coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior NHS officials reveals. The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for another 12 months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS. It also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time. Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population â€œare expectedâ€ to contract the virus. The document says that: â€œAs many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.â€ The briefing sets out the latest official thinking about how severely the infection could affect both the publicâ€™s health and that of personnel in critical services such as the NHS, police, the fire brigade and transport. It has been drawn up in recent days by PHEâ€™s emergency preparedness and response team and approved as accurate by Dr Susan Hopkins, PHEâ€™s lead official dealing with the outbreak. It has been shared with hospital bosses and senior doctors in the NHS in Engand. â€œFor the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about thatâ€, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. â€œA year is entirely plausible. But that figure isnâ€™t well appreciated or understood,â€ added Hunter, an expert in epidemiology. â€œI think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up,â€ he added. The admission that the virus will continue to cause problems for another year appears to undermine hopes that the arrival of warmer weather this summer would kill it. The document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work â€œin essential services and critical infrastructureâ€ will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: â€œIt is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.â€ Under revised health advice Boris Johnson unveiled last Thursday, anyone with a cough should self-isolate for at least seven days. The document also states that: The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are â€œunder significant demand pressuresâ€. From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested. Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients. A senior NHS figure involved in preparing for the growing â€œsurgeâ€ in patients whose lives are being put at risk by Covid-19 said an 80% infection rate could lead to more than half a million people dying. If the mortality rate turns out to be the 1% many experts are using as their working assumption then that would mean 531,100 deaths. But if Whittyâ€™s insistence that the rate will be closer to 0.6% proves accurate, then that would involve 318,660 people dying. Experts advising governments worldwide on the way epidemics grow and eventually decline say there will be a rapid rise in cases to a peak â€“ and then a falling off. Whitty, who has seen the modelling done by UK and global scientists, says the case numbers will go up fast over the next 10 to 14 weeks. That will mean a peak at around the end of May to mid-June, when the NHS will be under great pressure. The strategy of all countries is to delay that peak and stretch it out over a longer period of time, so that health services are better able to cope. There is also the possibility that new treatments will be available by then. After the peak, case numbers and deaths are expected to drop for 10 weeks or more, until they reach a fairly low level, which may not be zero. In the summer months especially, the case numbers are expected to reduce because people spend more time out of doors and are less likely to be confined at close quarters in small rooms in a house or office with people who are infected. There is still a worry that the virus could resurge in the autumn or winter months, which means planning for the long term will be necessary. Until a vaccine is developed, perhaps in 18 months, health planners cannot be sure of being able to protect people from the disease."
2,Covid-19   Medical schools urged to fast-track final-year students ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-medical-schools-urged-to-fast-track-final-year-students-to-help-fight-coronavirus,"UK medical schools have been urged to fast-track qualifications for final-year medical students, waiving requirements for clinical exams and using alternative assessments to enable them to be quickly registered as doctors in order to help tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Medical schools and departments at universities across Britain are facing the prospect of releasing their staff and students to help the NHS cope with the developing crisis. The leadership of the Medical Schools Council (MSC) has advised the UKâ€™s 42 medical schools that they should prioritise qualifying final-year students even if they have missed clinical exams, so they can be provisionally registered by the General Medical Council (GMC) to begin working as doctors as soon as possible. â€œIt is important that medical schools do not delay qualification and so prevent new doctors joining the workforce in the summer,â€ the letter from the MSCâ€™s co-chairs and chief executive said. â€œWe suggest that finals are simplified as far as possible, consistent with testing necessary learning objectives. We suggest patients are not used in final clinical exams. Ultimately it may not be possible to deliver any meaningful formal clinical exams, in which case the medical school should review the alternative methods of assessment that are available to them (previous exam results, placement grades etc).â€ Clinical teaching and exams using live patients are a crucial part of a medical studentâ€™s education, and the fear is that if clinical work was suspended then this yearâ€™s cohort of final-year students would face delays in qualifying as doctors, at a crucial time for an NHS already facing staff shortages. Students at the University of Cambridge were told last week that the schoolâ€™s clinical teaching would end, and that the university had sought approval from the GMC to cancel clinical exams. A spokesperson said the exams would have tied up more than 200 hospital doctors and GPs for more than two weeks, as well as students mingling with large numbers of patients, potentially exposing them to Covid-19 infection. â€œI am afraid that we have had to make some extremely difficult decisions, based on the principle that students going in and out of clinical environments could be an unnecessary source of virus transmission, they may be putting their patients and themselves at greater risk, and there may be too few staff available to deliver formal clinical teaching, either through pressure of work or illness,â€ students were told in an email from Prof Patrick Maxwell, the head of Cambridgeâ€™s school of clinical medicine. The university said the students have already completed their final written examinations and been assessed on clinical competence in previous exams and placements. Prof Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, has also told staff in an email: â€œThe medical science division is cancelling all clinical teaching until further notice in order to release clinical teachers to the wards.â€ Meanwhile, University College London has said it will release all clinical academics from their university roles if they want to help the NHS during the coronavirus crisis. â€œMany of our clinical academics may shortly be asked to support clinical services as the NHS faces increased pressure during the coronavirus outbreak. We have taken the decision to release colleagues from their UCL responsibilities to enable them to take a decision on this,â€ said Prof David Lomas, the universityâ€™s vice provost for health. The MSC said current students should be enabled to work in the NHS during the crisis, by working as call handlers for the NHSâ€™s 111 telephone service or taking over other non-critical roles to relieve staff. â€œWe predict that many medical students who have already passed finals will want to volunteer to work in the NHS and we encourage this. Important principles are that it must be their own decision, they should not be allowed to work beyond their competencies, they should be given full necessary personal protection and full instruction in its use, and they should be fully supervised with clear governance arrangements,â€ the letter states. â€œOpportunities may be available for post-finals medical students to assist in clinical services other than those dealing directly with patients with coronavirus infection. For example, helping in fracture clinics that are repurposed to deal with patients with minor injuries away from the emergency department environment.â€"
4,US  Trump 'offers large sums' for exclusive access to coronavirus vaccine ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine,"The Trump administration has offered a German medical company â€œlarge sums of moneyâ€ for exclusive access to a Covid-19 vaccine, German media have reported. The German government is trying to fight off what it sees as an aggressive takeover bid by the US, the broadsheet Die Welt reports, citing German government circles. The US president had offered the TÃ¼bingen-based biopharmaceutical company CureVac â€œlarge sums of moneyâ€ to gain exclusive access to their work, wrote Die Welt. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agencyÂ advisesÂ people to: Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit â€“ but not eliminate â€“ the risks, provided it is used correctly. Justin McCurry According to an anonymous source quoted in the newspaper, Trump was doing everything to secure a vaccine against the coronavirus for the US, â€œbut for the US onlyâ€. The German government was reportedly offering its own financial incentives for the vaccine to stay in the country. The German health minister Jens Spahn said that a takeover of the CureVac company by the Trump administration was â€œoff the tableâ€. CureVac would only develop vaccine â€œfor the whole worldâ€, Spahn said, â€œnot for individual countriesâ€. Earlier, when approached about the report by the Guardian, the German health ministry would only confirm the accuracy of the quotes attributed to one of its spokespersons in the article. â€œThe federal government is very interested in vaccines and antiviral agents against the novel coronavirus being developed in Germany and Europe,â€ the spokesperson quoted in the original article had said. â€œIn this regard the government is in an intensive exchange with the company CureVac.â€ The German health ministry spokesperson declined the opportunity to correct any inaccuracies in Die Weltâ€™s account. With its headquarters in the south-western German city of TÃ¼bingen, CureVac also has sites in Frankfurt and Boston in the US. Linked with the German health ministry, it works closely with the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a research institution and medical regulatory body that is subordinate to the German health ministry. On 11 March, CureVac released a statement that its CEO, the US citizen Daniel Menichella, was unexpectedly leaving the firm and would be replaced by the companyâ€™s founder, Ingmar Hoerr. At the start of the month, Menichella was invited to the White House in Washington to discuss strategy for the rapid development and production of a coronavirus vaccine with Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence, and members of the White House coronavirus task force. The White House has been contacted for comment. Additional reporting by Oliver Laughland"
6,Coronavirus latest  At a glance ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-15-march-at-a-glance,"Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The countryâ€™s death toll has increased by 25% to 1,809 from 1,441 on Sunday â€“ a rise of 368. The number of infected in the country has risen from 2,853 to 20,603. Meanwhile the overall total of cases, including those recovered is 27,747 The UK death toll from coronavirus has risen from 21 to 35, with one death in Scotland and the rest in England. The Department of Health and Social Careâ€™s latest figures show that as of 9am on Sunday the total number of cases stood at 1,372, up from 1,140 at the same time on Saturday. Deaths in Spain have more than doubled in a day, to 288, with the number of infections near 8,000. Across the country there are 7,753 confirmed cases, making Spain the second hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy. More than half of Spainâ€™s cases are in Madrid. Germany is to close its borders with France, Austria and Switzerland from 8am on Monday to try to stem the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, German media reported on Sunday afternoon. Exceptions are expected to be made for goods traffic and commuters. Several African countries have closed borders, cancelled flights and imposed strict entry and quarantine requirements to contain the spread of coronavirus. Kenya is not letting anyone in from countries with reported cases. Ghana is banning visitors from countries with more than 200 cases and Namibia has closed schools for a month following two confirmed cases. Schools in the Netherlands are set to close from Monday as the Dutch government steps up measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. All restaurants, bars and sports clubs have also been ordered to close from Sunday evening. The measures will last until 6 April. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he would not rule out closing the countryâ€™s borders or forcing people arriving from foreign nations to self-isolate to help combat a coronavirus outbreak. He told CTV: â€œWe are not taking anything off the table.â€ So far, 249 Canadians have tested positive for Covid-19 and one person has died. The Trump administration has offered German medical company CureVac â€œlarge sums of moneyâ€ for exclusive access to a Covid-19 vaccine, German broadsheet Die Welt reports, citing German government circles. According to an anonymous source quoted in the newspaper, Trump was doing everything to secure a vaccine against the coronavirus for the US, â€œbut for the US onlyâ€. All pubs and bars in the Republic of Ireland have been ordered to close from Sunday evening to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. The government said there would be â€œreal difficultyâ€ in implementing social distancing in pubs, and has also asked people not to throw private parties that would put other peopleâ€™s health at risk. A gathering at a mosque in Malaysia that attracted 16,000 attendees has been linked to a major spike in infections in the country, as well as clusters of cases in nearby countries. On Sunday, officials in Malaysia confirmed 190 new patients had been identified, the biggest leap in cases in the country yet, making it the worst-hit nation in south-east Asia."
7,"Global roundup  Beijing backtracks, Paris locks up and Spain locks down ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-measures-india-france-spain-china,"The French prime minister announced the closure of cafes, restaurants and all public places â€œnon-essentialâ€ to public life, including cinemas and discos, from midnight on Saturday . Edouard Philippe said: â€œWe must absolutely limit movement, meetings and contacts.â€ But he allowed food shops, tobacconists, banks and public transport to remain open. French authorities also warned that widely used over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs may worsen the coronavirus, as the number of cases across the country jumped to 4,480. There have been 91 deaths, and France is one of several countries across Europe that have gone into lockdown. Schools closed after final lessons last week, meaning 12.4 million students will remain at home, where the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has warned they will be expected to follow the national curriculum syllabus online. Authorities have banned gatherings of more than 100 people and shut down attractions including the Eiffel Tower, the palace of Versailles, the Louvre and the MusÃ©e dâ€™Orsay. In the Paris region, there will be no Sunday masses. The health minister, Olivier VÃ©ran, said the evolution and spread of the virus was â€œrapid and realâ€, but added that about 98% of those who test positive for the virus do recover.  Health officials point out that anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the bodyâ€™s immune system. The health ministry added that patients should choose paracetamol because â€œit will reduce the fever without counter-attacking the inflammationâ€. Kim Willsher The number of imported coronavirus cases now exceeds locally transmitted new infections for the first time, data from Chinaâ€™s national health commission shows. On Friday it had 11 new cases, but seven were brought in by travellers from the US, Italy and Saudi Arabia, and only four were transmitted inside the country. At least one of these was a US-based Chinese citizen, who reportedly returned home in search of medical treatment after requests for a test were turned down in Massachusetts, where she lived. Beijing has been providing free treatment as part of its effort to halt the spread of the virus. But apparently in anticipation of more people arriving from abroad with the disease, it has drawn up a policy that will require most to pay for their own care. Emma Graham-Harrison The Spanish government declared a state of emergency on Saturday, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to leave their homes only if they needed to buy food, medicine, or go to work or hospital. The lockdown comes after schools across the country were closed for a fortnight and the regional governments of Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias ordered the closure of all non-essential shops. The only businesses permitted to remain open are supermarkets, bakeries, butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers, petrol stations, pharmacies, tobacconists and newspaper kiosks. Madridâ€™s city council announced the closure of all public parks and gardens to prevent large concentrations of people, while Seville, Granada and CÃ³rdoba cancelled their Holy Week celebrations. The Catalan president, Quim Torra, announced plans to close off the north-eastern region and called on the central government to assist by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways. After Italy, Spain is the European country most affected by the coronavirus, and has confirmed 6,391 cases and 196 deaths. Jet2, which flies from nine UK airports to destinations including Alicante, MÃ¡laga and Lanzarote, said it was cancelling all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. The socialist-led government of prime minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, whose wife tested positive for Covid-19 last night, has been fiercely criticised for its delay in rolling out robust measures to fight the virus and for allowing huge rallies across the country last Sunday to mark International Womenâ€™s Day. A state of emergency has not been declared since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllersâ€™ strike. It will initially apply for two weeks. Sam Jones Fears are growing about the spread of the virus in the worldâ€™s second-most populous country after it recorded its second death. India has an impressive record in tackling infectious diseases, including defeating polio, and in 2009 curbing the swine flu pandemic. But it also has a stretched and uneven public health system. The latest victim, a 68-year-old woman, caught the virus from her son after he travelled to Italy and Switzerland. He works at a large plant and may have been in contact with up to 1,500 people. With 102 cases confirmed, the New Delhi government has invoked the Epidemic Act, which allows authorities to force people into isolation, and has brought in laws to prevent hoarding of hand sanitisers. In many states, social life is being curbed, with gyms, pools, cinemas and theatres closed, and weddings, engagements and birthday parties banned in southern Karnataka. Emma Graham-Harrison "
0,Education  Schools in England struggle to stay open as coronavirus hits attendance ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/schools-across-england-struggle-as-coronavirus-hits-attendance,"Schools across England are struggling to stay open, with some forced to partially or fully close as staff and students stay at home, while the UK remains one of only two European countries â€“ alongside Belarus â€“ with a policy of keeping them open. Headteachers have said they were blindsided by Mondayâ€™s government advice for the public to avoid non-essential contact. Pressure has been growing on the government to shut schools, after Finland announced wholescale closures on Monday and Sweden advised its colleges to close. Several schools have announced closures because of staff shortages, in some cases with only pupils on GCSE and A-levels courses allowed to remain. But many other school leaders are being forced to consider closures as more staff are off because of self-isolation or caring for vulnerable relatives. Headteachers complained they had received little or nothing in the way of direct advice from the Department for Education about coping with staff shortages or even why they need to stay open. â€œWeâ€™re deeply worried by this â€“ we have lots of staff now off looking after vulnerable relatives and there are absolutely no supply teachers out there. Everyone who can be on duty is already here, and I expect things to get worse day by day,â€ said George Croxford, the headteacher of Royal Wootton Bassett academy in Wiltshire. â€œThe prime minister told people to avoid contact but we have nearly 200 adults working here. What about them?â€ Schools in London appear to be hardest hit overall, although one secondary school in Berkshire said that absentee rates for both pupils and staff were running at 20% or more, after Boris Johnson announced new policies on Monday night telling the public to avoid all non-essential travel and contact and advising those with any symptoms to remain in isolation for 14 days. Derbyshire county council issued an alert that Dronfield Henry Fanshawe school would be closed from Tuesday. Martyn Cooper, the head, told parents: â€œWe have analysed the staffing and concluded that there is a significant number of staff who will not be able to come to school. This means that it will not be possible to function safely and securely as a school.â€ The Ark Bolingbroke academy in Wandsworth, south-west London, has announced it will close indefinitely from Wednesday for pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 because of â€œlogistical and staffing issues which make this challengingâ€. â€œIt is our intention to remain open for year 11 and 13 for as long as possible, which will be dependent on the exams system for this summer,â€ the school told parents South Shore academy in Blackpool also said it was partially closing until further notice â€œdue to high levels of staff absenceâ€. The school will only teach pupils studying for GCSEs, although those eligible for free school meals can pick up packed lunches. City of London girlsâ€™ school, an independent school, announced that it would close from Wednesday, â€œin the face of unsustainable pupil and staff absence from the site over the past couple of daysâ€, said Jenny Brown, the schoolâ€™s head. Pupils will be given remote learning in all subjects. Other schools are putting year groups on revolving closures. Maiden Erlegh school in Berkshire said that from Wednesday most pupils would only attend every other day, although pupils preparing for exams will remain fulltime.â€œClosing the school to any student is among the hardest decisions I have to make as a headteacher,â€ said Paul Gibson, the schoolâ€™s principal. â€œHowever, we just cannot operate the school safely with the numbers of staff now absent.â€ Schools that remain open are drawing up contingency plans for closure in the near future, with some vowing to keep their kitchens open in order to feed children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Chris Dyson, the head of Parklands primary in Leeds, said his school kitchen would remain open to supply lunches to primary age children in the city who are entitled to free school meals. â€œMy parents at my school would come in to collect at takeaway lunch and weâ€™d act as a central hub, cooking for all the schools in Leeds,â€ said Dyson. About 80% of the children at Parklands are entitled to free school meals. Dyson, like most heads, has drawn up a crisis plan which will ensure that as well as ensuring no one goes hungry, all pupils have contact from staff at least once a week, with additional support for vulnerable families and twice-weekly visits to family homes for children with protection concerns. In the meantime, the school has been putting together homework activities, paying particular attention to children who may not have access to online resources. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said reports suggested 10-20% of teachers were self-isolating and the number was rising. School attendance was also falling, he said, typically running at between 70-80%. â€œIt is clearly becoming increasingly difficult to keep schools open and we now urgently need some clear strategic planning from the government,â€ Barton said. The DfE announced that regular Ofsted inspections of schools, colleges and social care provision in England would be suspended for the time being, following similar decisions in Scotland and Wales. â€œItâ€™s clearly the right thing to do when teachers and social workers are under pressure as a result of the coronavirus outbreak,â€ said Amanda Spielman, Ofstedâ€™s chief inspector of schools in England. The National Education Union released a letter it has sent to Johnson, calling on him to order at least partial closures of schools in England in recognition of the staffing problems created by his policy yesterday, which advised vulnerable groups to isolate for 12 weeks. â€œGiven your failure to release modelling comparing different scenarios of school closures, we are now forced to call on you to close schools, at least for some time and at least in some areas,â€ the letter from the NEUâ€™s general secretaries states."
2,Harry and Meghan  Couple take 'appropriate measures' after possible coronavirus exposure ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/harry-and-meghan-appropriate-measures-coronavirus,"ï»¿The Queen will decamp to Windsor Castle, cancel her traditional garden parties and postpone investitures as the threat of coronavirus sees a wholesale ripping up of the royal diaries for all members of her family. Buckingham Palace has announced that the monarch, who will be 94 next month, will move from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle on Thursday and is expected to remain there for some time. â€œHer Majesty will move to Windsor Castle for the Easter period on Thursday 19 March, one week earlier than planned. It is likely the Queen will stay there beyond the Easter period,â€ it said in a statement. The precautionary measures follow the governmentâ€™s announcement that the spread of coronavirus in London is thought to be some weeks ahead of the rest of UK. Officials are concerned for the welfare of both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, who since retiring spends his time on the Queenâ€™s Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to be taking â€œappropriate measuresâ€ over coronavirus after suggestions that Prince Harry could have been exposed to it during his final UK engagements this month. Harry hugged Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton as the two opened the Silverstone Experience Centre on 6 March. Two days before, Hamilton was photographed at the WE Day UK charity events in London alongside the actor Idris Elba and Sophie Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister â€“ both of whom have since tested positive for Covid-19. The Queen has already cancelled planned engagements in Cheshire and Camden as a â€œsensible precautionâ€ because of her propensity to attract crowds, and to prevent any drain on over-stretched services required to host such public events. Following consultation between her medical household and the government, other events pencilled in for â€œthe coming monthsâ€ are also now being cancelled as part of unprecedented peacetime measures to try and control the spread of the virus. These include the Maundy service at St Georgeâ€™s Chapel on 9 April. â€œThree garden parties hosted by the Queen, due to be held at Buckingham Palace in May, will not now take place,â€ a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. â€œGuests already invited to these garden parties will be asked to attend in 2021. â€œTwo additional garden parties given for the Not Forgotten Association and the National Trust will also not take place.â€ A decision is yet to be made on the annual garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Trooping the Colour, one of the annual highlights of the royal calendar and one of the family events which the Prince Harry and Meghan were expected to attend, is also in doubt, as is the 75th anniversary of VE Day and the state visit by the Emperor and Empress of Japan. Further announcements on these â€œwill be made in due course in consultation with the governmentâ€. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on whether Harry and Meghan were self-isolating at their Vancouver Island retreat. One source said that that the couple would be taking â€œappropriate measures and following government adviceâ€. Trudeau announced last week that she had put herself in quarantine, having been tested after experiencing mild symptoms on her return from London. Elba revealed on Monday he had tested positive via a video on Twitter, in which he said he felt OK and that he had no symptoms but had decided to self-isolate. The Luther actor said he only got tested after coming into contact with someone who later confirmed they had coronavirus, but did not give details of who that person was. Hamilton has urged fans to take coronavirus seriously, and has posted a video showing how to hand-wash on his Twitter account. It is not known if he has been tested for the virus. Harry flew back to Canada just before Justin Trudeau announced the closure of Canadaâ€™s borders to stop the spread. Trudeau has urged Canadians to stay at home â€œas much as possibleâ€."
4,"New data, new policy  Why UK's coronavirus strategy changed ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed,"A week is a long time in a coronavirus pandemic. Within days of Boris Johnson and his advisers announcing that anyone with symptoms of a cold should stay at home for seven days but otherwise live life as normal, the prime minister came out with a series of bombshells that will effectively confine most of the population to their homes. What changed was new data on the impact of Italyâ€™s out-of-control epidemic on its health service. Basically, it is catastrophic, with 30% of hospitalised patients having to be admitted to intensive care. The teams of modellers at Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who advise government crunched those numbers â€“ and the death toll and pressure on the NHS that came out were unacceptable. Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial Collegeâ€™s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and colleagues found that the mitigation strategy, as they called it â€“ or scenario 1 â€“ that the government had just announced would lead to 260,000 deaths. That would be not just deaths from the virus, but from other illnesses that the NHS would be too hard-pressed to treat. Their modelling looked at all the interventions that might help drive down the infections and deaths. There were five, they said, that would have an impact: â€¢ isolating people with a cough and temperature at home for seven days. â€¢ quarantining families where somebody has symptoms for 14 days, to allow time for any symptoms in the others to show. â€¢ social distancing, involving cutting the normal contacts people make at home, school or work by three-quarters. â€¢ social distancing for everyone over 70, by asking them to stay at home. â€¢ closure of schools and universities. Last weekâ€™s mitigation strategy was about people staying home for seven days with symptoms. It was said that quarantine for families plus keeping the over-70s at home would probably follow. That package would reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and cut deaths by half. But, the researchers said, â€œthe resulting epidemic would still likely result in 260,000 deaths and therefore overwhelm the health system (most notably intensive care units)â€. So now we have scenario 2, which the modellers call suppression. It takes things much further, adopting all the measures except closing schools and universities. And school closures, said Ferguson, are probably also on the cards before too long. Ferguson and his colleague Prof Azra Ghani liken the new measures to Chinaâ€™s actions, which succeeded in driving down the epidemic to very low numbers. But unlike in China, anything that happens in the UK will be voluntary. The government will need population buy-in for this to work. The bad news is that although it will keep death rates down to 20,000 or possibly just a few thousand, said Ferguson, we are looking at these social curbs through to July or August â€“ and even when the brakes are taken off, they may have to be slammed back on again. The virus will not have disappeared and could resurge. Only a small proportion of the population will have been infected, recovered and become immune. The governmentâ€™s earlier hopes that it could rely on large proportions â€“ maybe 60% â€“ of the population getting ill, getting better and becoming immune to build up some herd immunity in the UK population â€“ something many experts thought was dangerous â€“ are dashed by the new strategy. Herd immunity is normally created by vaccinating large numbers of children, safeguarding those who cannot be inoculated. Nobody has ever tried to do that by allowing infection with a disease before â€“ and now, it appears to have been recognised that itâ€™s not safe to try."
5,At a glance  Coronavirus latest  ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-tuesday,"Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Saudi Arabia, the chair of the group of the 20 most industrialised nations, is to stage a virtual G20 summit in the coming days in a bid to show world leaders have coordinated medical and economic plans to control coronavirus. Members of the G20, mainly western nations and Japan, held a smaller virtual summit on Monday promising to do whatever it takes to bring the west through the crisis. The G20 also brings in China, India, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Turkey, Australia and South Africa, and other big drivers of the world economy Iran has temporarily freed a total of 85,000 prisoners, including political prisoners, a spokesman for its judiciary said on Tuesday, adding that the prisons were responding to the threat of a coronavirus epidemic in jails. â€œSome 50% of those released are security-related prisoners. Also in the jails we have taken precautionary measures to confront the outbreak,â€ the spokesman, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said. Britain had â€œno time to loseâ€ in changing tactics in order to prevent thousands of deaths and the NHS being overwhelmed, scientists providing guidance to the UK government have said. The Imperial College Covid-19 response team â€“ which is one of several scientific teams advising UK ministers â€“ published a paper showing that 250,000 people could die if efforts were focused only on delaying and slowing down the spread of Covid-19. Separately, Englandâ€™s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, could not rule out the strict measures having to last for a year but predicted they will last at least â€œseveral monthsâ€œ. Australiaâ€™s department of foreign affairs has advised Australians to return home as soon as possible by commercial means because overseas travel is becoming â€œmore complex and difficultâ€ as countries impose travel restrictions and close their borders. The new travel advice, issued on Tuesday night, triggered speculation that the Morrison government could be about to impose a lockdown in Australia. But officials told Guardian Australia that was not in contemplation. The European Union is set to endorse the strictest travel ban in its history â€“ with France joining Italy and Spain in full lockdown â€“ as Donald Trump told Americans to change their behaviour, acknowledging for the first time that beating the coronavirus could take months. Leaders of EU states were expected on Tuesday to suspend all travel into the passport-free Schengen zone by non-EU nationals for at least 30 days in a bid to instil uniformity across the bloc after some member states, including Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, unilaterally began imposing border checks. Germanyâ€™s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has announced that the government was going to start an operation to bring home thousands of citizens who have been stranded abroad by the coronavirus. More countries and cities around the world followed each other in locking down borders and introducing draconian restrictions on citizensâ€™ movements or enforcing quarantines on new arrivals They included moves by Vietnam to start mandatory quarantines of all arrivals from the US, Europe and countries from the ASEAN group. In India, airports and hospitals in Mumbai were ordered to use 14-day ink to stamp the left hand of those who were to be quarantined at home. In Spain, one of the European countries hardest hit, the virus claimed more than 150 lives in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 491, health authorities said on Tuesday. The number of confirmed cases across the country sits at 11,178 â€“ the first time that known cases in Spain have officially passed the 10,000 mark. Nearly half of the cases are in the Madrid region. Among the latest to test positive were several more players and coaching staff of La Ligaâ€™s Valencia. China has issued an angry reaction to US president Donald Trumpâ€™s characterisation of the disease as â€œthe Chinese virusâ€. Chinaâ€™s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said the US president should take care of his own matters first and not seek to â€œstigmatiseâ€ China. Three US states will hold their Democratic presidential primaries as scheduled on Tuesday, but an election in Ohio was thrust into chaos when the state defied a judgeâ€™s orders and proceeded to delay the election hours before polls open amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are competing again on Tuesday for the opportunity to lead their party in a campaign season suddenly overshadowed by a pandemic that closed borders, shaken the economy and swept every corner of public life. China has authorised clinical trials on its first vaccine developed to combat the new coronavirus, state media reported on Tuesday. In other developments, the US company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said it had identified hundreds of antibodies that could potentially treat the coronavirus. The postponement of soccerâ€™s Euro 2020 championships may already have been decided after Uefa last week cancelled its hotel bookings in Copenhagen. Uefa has called a video conference for Tuesday to discuss footballâ€™s response to the coronavirus crisis, with all 55 of Europeâ€™s football associations, the European Club Association, European Leagues and the international playersâ€™ union Fifpro. Thailand reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, raising the total to 177, with 70-80% of them in Bangkok, according to the health ministry. Cambodia reported 12 new cases, bringing the total to 24."
1,Environment  Coronavirus could cause fall in global CO2 emissions ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-could-cause-fall-in-global-co2-emissions,"Governments should act with the same urgency on climate as on the coronavirus, leading campaigners say, as evidence mounts that the health crisis is reducing carbon emissions more than any policy. The deadly virus outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people and infected more than 114,000, has caused alarm around the world. However, unlike the response to global heating, it has shown how political and corporate leaders can take radical emergency action on the advice of scientists to protect human wellbeing. In China â€“ the source of the disease and the worldâ€™s largest carbon emitter â€“ the actions taken by authorities have inadvertently demonstrated that hefty 25% carbon dioxide cuts can bring less traffic and cleaner air with only a small reduction in economic growth, according to a study by Carbon Brief. If this trend continues, analysts say it is possible this will lead to the first fall in global emissions since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Even a slowdown in CO2 could buy time for climate action and, more importantly, inspire long-term behavioural changes â€“ particularly in travel. On the advice of health authorities, millions of people are avoiding school journeys, shopping runs and office commutes. Tens of thousands of flights have been cancelled. Italian bishops are not conducting mass. Across much of central China, factories have been closed, with knock-on effects around the world. The virus has disrupted several events linked to the fossil fuel industry. In the past few weeks, the Geneva Motor Show was cancelled, after Switzerland banned all public gatherings of more than 1,000 people. In Houston, the giant annual CeraWeek gathering of oil and gas executives was called off, as was the Formula One grand prix in Shanghai. More carbon savings will come from the cancellations of international conferences. Donald Trump has postponed a 14 March summit with the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The London Book Fair, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Adobeâ€™s annual live summit and even South by Southwest, the huge annual film, music and media conference in Austin, Texas, have all been called off, which means thousands of tonnes less CO2 from flights taken by international delegates. The worlds of entertainment, fashion and sport are similarly affected. Stormzy, Mariah Carey, Slipknot and New Order have all cancelled or postponed gigs, though most of the attendees were likely to have been local so the climate impact will be more modest. A bigger effect is likely to come from the postponement of Art Dubai, the biggest art fair in the Middle East. The closure for several weeks of Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea, or the Universal Studios theme park in Osaka, Shanghai Disneyland and other attractions that usually draw tens of thousands of visitors every day, are also expected to result in fewer flights. Global air traffic decreased by 4.3% in February with cancellations of tens of thousands of flights to affected areas. But Rob Jackson, the chair of Global Carbon Project, said this would only be meaningful if it led to long-term behavioural change, particularly in aviation, which is one of the fastest growing source of emissions. â€œIf this could change the way we travel, it could lead to more virtual meetings,â€ he said. Otherwise, â€œI see no silver lining to the coronavirus. If gas emissions drop temporarily then great, but it wonâ€™t be a meaningful change in the long term unless it shocks us in a global recession. Nobody wanted that in 2008 and nobody wants it now.â€ There are encouraging signs. The 189-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank, will replace their usual spring gathering in Washington with a virtual teleconference. This is a one-off emergency measure, but the economic and carbon savings could prompt calls for this to become the norm every year. The question is whether changes are temporary. Chinaâ€™s climate gains â€“ so far estimated at about 200 megatonnes of CO2 â€“ could be short-lived if factories later reopen and crank up production to make up for lost business. President Xi Jinping has indicated the government will provide extra stimulus packages to help the economy recover. Some reports suggest this could prove counterproductive for the climate if this means ramping up coal production or relaxing environmental controls. The last time China suffered a major threat to GDP growth was during the 2008-9 financial crisis. Within a year, extra government spending ensured both the economy and CO2 were back on an upward trajectory. Analysts say it is too early to know if coronavirus will push global CO2 emissions onto the downward path that is needed if the world is to have any hope of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. That depends on how far the outbreak spreads, and whether the economic effects are prolonged. Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia, said that so far the crisis is only likely to slow CO2 growth, not reverse it. â€œOver the past 10 years, emissions have grown at an annual rate of 1%, or about 317 megatonnes, so you would need a really big reduction to see a fall this year. Itâ€™s plausible but I donâ€™t think we can say at this stage.â€ But, Le QuÃ©rÃ© noted, even a slowdown would gain time for action â€“ advances in technology, lower renewables prices and more public pressure on governments to change tack. The response to the coronavirus could also demonstrate that radical steps can work. â€œYou can see that when governments see there is an emergency they act straight away with measures commensurate with the threat. That assessment has not yet been made in the case of climate change although governments have declared it an emergency,â€ she said. If the outbreak continues, there are concerns that the virus could also force the cancellation of the EU-China summit in Leipzig in September, which would be bad news for diplomatic efforts to build a climate alliance between these two powers. US author and environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote that no environmentalist should welcome a crisis, but they could learn from it: â€œCompletely apart from the human toll, economic disruption is not a politically viable way to deal with global warming in the long term, and it also undercuts the engines of innovation that bring us, say, cheap solar panels.â€ But McKibben is more optimistic about the demonstration that people can change. â€œItâ€™s worth noting how nimbly millions of people seem to have learned new patterns. Companies, for instance, are scrambling to stay productive, even with many people working from home. â€œThe idea that we need to travel each day to a central location to do our work may often be the result of inertia, more than anything else. Faced with a real need to commute by mouse, instead of by car, perhaps weâ€™ll see that the benefits of workplace flexibility extend to everything from gasoline consumption to the need for sprawling office parks.â€"
3,Tweet v pandemic  Has Trump met his match in coronavirus? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response,"It has killed thousands, sown widespread fear and disruption and caused the worst day for Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. One man, however, is not panicking about the coronavirus. Donald Trump just spent two successive days on the golf course. Even for a US president who has made a habit of denialism â€“ from global heating to the size of Barack Obamaâ€™s inauguration crowd â€“ the current crisis is raising the bar. One headline on Monday described it as â€œTrumpâ€™s Chernobylâ€, a reference to the Soviet nuclear disaster that authorities could not censor away. The commander-in-chiefâ€™s past attempts to bend reality to his will have often been met with derision or mirth. But this time it is hardly an exaggeration to say thousands of lives are at stake. The international crisis that many feared would test his norm-busting presidency has arrived. â€œDenial, accusation, distraction, lies â€“ these are his four principal responses to any rival,â€ said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. â€œOnly this time itâ€™s not a person. When you think of that model, it doesnâ€™t work with germs. A tweet doesnâ€™t knock over a potential global pandemic.â€ At a Fox News town hall last week, Trump was reminded that he is a â€œself-proclaimed germaphobeâ€. Blair added: â€œHeâ€™s been quite the germaphobe for many decades. One time I interviewed him he said: â€˜Youâ€™re lucky I shook your hand.â€™ In the election campaign and Oval Office, it was hard for him to not shake hands but we can be sure there was a bottle of Purell nearby.â€ Trump has contradicted experts to downplay the coronavirus threat, perhaps not least because it could hurt him in a presidential election year. He has inaccurately claimed that a vaccine will be available soon, that anyone who wants a test can get one and that the virus will be killed off by the spring weather. â€œA lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat â€“ as the heat comes in,â€ he said last month. â€œTypically, that will go away in April.â€ And despite years of warnings from scientists that a pandemic would come someday, Trump has reduced the the White House national security staff and cut jobs addressing global pandemics. He has sought to portray the coronavirus as a bolt from the blue. â€œWho would have thought?â€ he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. â€œWho would have thought we would even be having the subject?â€™â€ When reality does not fit, Trump tries to find a workaround. Visiting the CDC while wearing a red â€œKeep America Greatâ€ cap, he suggested he would prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they would not inflate the national total. â€œI like the numbers being where they are,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasnâ€™t our fault ... Iâ€™d rather have them stay on, personally.â€ The blasÃ© president spent the weekend playing golf in Florida, then began Monday fundraising for his re-election before making a fleeting appearance at a White House briefing. On Twitter, he continued to deny the impact of the virus on tumbling stocks: â€œSaudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!â€ He also continued to express â€œnothing to see hereâ€ views out of step with the public mood. â€œSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu,â€ he wrote. â€œIt averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!â€ Trump has had a history of defying political conventions but the game is up Trump has also accused Democrats of seeking to exploit the virus for political gain. Such comments have caused dismay among public health officials. Critics say the president is clearly out of his depth. Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project and author of Everything Trump Touches Dies, said: â€œWhen Trump is confronted with something that doesnâ€™t follow him on Twitter, that doesnâ€™t watch him on Fox News and doesnâ€™t come to his rallies, heâ€™s lost. â€œTrump is a day trader. He runs out every morning and throws whatever heâ€™s got in his head against the wall. It does not do the country a service when he is strongly inclined to believe his own bullshit.â€ Wilson, who has experience in crisis management, described the presidentâ€™s response so far as â€œthe usual Trumpian irresponsibility and mendacity in one packageâ€. He added: â€œPresidents get judged not on the easy stuff but the hard stuff. Heâ€™s going to have people judging him on how heâ€™s handled this. He has not inspired confidence.â€ Trump previously appeared blasÃ© and uncaring when Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. He memorably tossed paper towels into a crowd. But the coronavirus is on another scale altogether. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: â€œTrump has had a history of defying political conventions but the game is up. He has made a colossal mistake with how heâ€™s handling the coronavirus. He has put himself front and centre. â€œHe has belittled experts, his administration has not made adequate preparations and he undermined existing precautions and steps that had been taken for just this emergency. His fingerprints are all over this.â€ Jacobs added: â€œTrump appears disconnected from reality. While every American is thinking about precautions and wondering about keeping their children home from school, Trump, by underplaying whatâ€™s going on, is detached from the reality that middle America is struggling with.â€"
5,Explainer  What's the mortality rate and is there a cure? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-facts-mortality-rate-is-there-cure,"The Covid-19 virus is a member of the coronavirus family that made the jump from animals to humans late last year. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans â€“ current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirusâ€™s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agencyÂ advisesÂ people to: Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are divided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit â€“ but not eliminate â€“ the risks, provided it is used correctly. Justin McCurry The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two â€“ the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy. Typical flu symptoms, which normally come on quickly, include a high fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, shivers, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, more occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea. Doctors are still working to understand the full scope of symptoms and severity for Covid-19, but early studies of patients taken to hospital found nearly all of them developed a fever and dry cough, and many had fatigue and muscle aches. Pneumonia (lung infection) is common in coronavirus patients, even outside the most severe cases, and this can lead to breathing difficulties. A runny nose and sore throat are far less common, reported by just 5% of patients. The only real confirmation of having Covid-19 is taking a test though. If you have symptoms or think you might have been exposed to the virus when travelling or through other contacts, call the NHS 111 service or visit the online service, or contact the equivalent service in your country. Do not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital. A large study in China found that about 80% of confirmed cases had fairly mild symptoms (defined as no significant infection in the lungs). About 15% had severe symptoms that caused significant shortness of breath, low blood oxygen or other lung problems, and fewer than 5% of cases were critical, featuring respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ problems. However, it is possible that a larger number of very mild cases are going under the radar, and so this breakdown in severity could change over time as wider screening takes place. Older people and those with respiratory problems, heart disease or diabetes are at greater risk. It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. Much higher figures have been flying about, but the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is one of those who believes it will prove to be 1% or lower. The World Health Organizationâ€™s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, talked of 3.4%, but his figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases. We know there are many more mild cases that do not get to hospital and are not being counted, which would bring the mortality rate significantly down. Deaths are highest in the elderly, with very low rates among younger people, although medical staff who treat patients and get exposed to a lot of virus are thought to be more at risk. But even among the over-80s, 90% will recover. Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube â€“ though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes. Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected. Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial by the end of April. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months â€œwas not unreasonable to assumeâ€."
6,Russia  Putin backs proposal allowing him to remain in power beyond 2024 ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/vladimir-putin-amendment-power-russia-2024,"Vladimir Putin has moved to cement his hold on power in Russia beyond the middle of the decade, backing a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow him to seek another two terms in the Kremlin. The Russian president is required by the constitution to step down in 2024 when his second sequential presidential term ends. That deadline had led to months of conjecture about how Putin would stay in power in Russia, or at least ensure a safe transition for himself. In the end, the puzzle was resolved in an afternoon, in a series of choreographed political steps that took just over three hours and could see Putin stay on as president until 2036. The venture began in parliament, where a member of Russiaâ€™s ruling party proposed amending the constitution in a way that would reset Putinâ€™s presidential term count back to zero. Putin then announced he would come to address the parliament himself, prompting breathless coverage on state television about whether he would accept or turn down the proposal.  He backed it. â€œIn principle, this option would be possible, but on one condition â€“ if the constitutional court gives an official ruling that such an amendment would not contradict the principles and main provisions of the constitution,â€ Putin said, addressing the proposal last during a half-hour speech. He also said the move would have to be approved by the public in a referendum next month. It was a significant, if not surprising, about-face for the president, who had signalled publicly in recent months that he could indeed leave the presidency. In January, he told a veteran of the second world war that he was worried of a return to the 1980s, when Kremlin leaders â€œstayed in power until the end of their days,â€ and didnâ€™t provide for a transition of power. On Tuesday, he walked back that statement, saying that modern Russiaâ€™s elections made it impossible to return to a Soviet-style processions of leaders-for-life. â€œI wonâ€™t hide that I was wrong,â€ he told lawmakers during his speech. â€œIt was an incorrect statement because during the Soviet Union there were no elections.â€ With Putinâ€™s support, there is little doubt the measure will pass. Support from the constitutional court is likely to be a rubber stamp. And less than an hour after Putin had addressed lawmakers, the Duma had approved the amendment as part of a wider revision of Russiaâ€™s constitution. The Russian president, who has ruled since the turn of the century, gave his support to the amendment put forward by Valentina Tereshkova, an MP who, as a Soviet cosmonaut, became the first woman to fly to space. Tereshkova proposed either scrapping presidential term limits or amending the Russian constitution to let Putin run again. A series of constitutional amendments are going to a nationwide vote on 22 April. In an address to lawmakers in the Kremlin-controlled State Duma, Russiaâ€™s lower house of parliament, Putin spoke against scrapping term limits, but backed the idea of revising the ceiling. The current law limits presidents to two consecutive terms. Putinâ€™s current six-year term expires in 2024. The 67-year-old has been in power for 20 years, becoming Russiaâ€™s longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent. Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin. Putin wins a surprisingly narrow majority in his first presidential election, taking 53% of the vote and avoiding a second round run-off. Putin consolidates his centralised control of power by cruising to a second term as president with 71% of the vote, having limited press access to his opponents and harassing their campaigns. Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem. Amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging, Putin returns to the role of president, takingÂ 63.6%.Â Medvedev becomes his prime minister. ""Putin has named himself the emperor of Russia for the next 12 years,"" saysÂ  protest leader Alexei Navalny.Â  Putin is re-elected until 2024 with 77% of the vote, amid high tensions between London and Moscow over the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Opposition activists highlight a number of cases of vote-rigging and statistical anomalies. Tereshkova had told the Duma earlier on Tuesday: â€œThe very existence of an opportunity for the current president [to be re-elected], given his major gravitas, would be a stabilising factor for our society.â€ Putin appeared in the Duma after its speaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, announced a 90-minute break in the session to ponder the proposal and said Putin would come to the chamber himself to speak about it. â€œThe amendment Tereshkova has come forward with requires consulting with the current president,â€ Volodin said. The decision comes after a months-long effort to revise Russiaâ€™s constitution announced in January by Putin, whom analysts believed was seeking another seat in government to maintain power and ensure his personal safety after leaving the presidency. Putin on Tuesday also said he opposed two other amendments to Russiaâ€™s constitution: one that would entirely eliminate presidential term limits, and another that would provide for snap parliamentary elections."
0,Three key coronavirus signs to watch out for and stay isolated if you think you have them - they're more common than you might think,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-symptoms-take-five-days-21665230,"Researchers say the latest evidence about silent coronavirus symptoms backs up the 14-day quarantine measures being used in countries including the UK People who catch the killer coronavirus are symptom-free for an average of five days - almost twice as long as the common cold, new research has found. Experts are warning the three signs to watch out for are: a cough, a high temperature, and shortness of breath. But the new findings suggest workmates, family-members and classmates could be at risk for a full working week - before a virus carrier was even aware they had the infection. The study says infected individuals should expect to begin feeling unwell ""within 12 days"" - although in rare cases the incubation period can last longer, reports Devon Live. The findings support current recommendations introduced in countries including the UK to isolate those who may have been exposed to Covid-19 for 14 days. Five people in the UK have died after contracting the virus, and the number infected has now hit 321 - with the total rising daily. Italy has imposed strict lockdown measures on its population amid a major outbreak in the country, as the global case count tops 100,000. Brits are being warned to avoid all but essential travel to the country, as the death toll climbs. Study senior author professor Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US, said: ""Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of 14 days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable."" But he added: ""With that period some cases would be missed over the long-term."" The latest study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine - the most extensive of its kind - analysed 50 provinces, regions and countries outside Wuhan, China, where the disease emerged. It reviewed news reports, public health papers and press releases to estimate the length of time from exposure to the onset of symptoms. The US team found information on 181 confirmed cases prior to 24 February where ""incubation windows"" could be identified - the time from exposure to symptom onset. They said: ""Most involved travel to or from Wuhan, China, the city at the centre of the epidemic, or exposure to individuals who had been to Hubei, the province for which Wuhan is the capital."" This enabled them to estimate an average period of 5.1 days. Current understanding of this has been limited. Prof Lessler said: ""Human coronaviruses that cause common colds have mean illness-incubation periods of about three days."" Almost all (97.5 per cent) patients appeared to develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Prof Lessler said: ""These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, only 101 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine, which supports current CDC recommendations."" The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises active monitoring of people for 14 days after an assumed exposure to COVID-19. Many other authorities around the world - including Public Health England - have been using the same guide for those known to be at high risk of infection due to contact with patients or travel to a heavily affected area. The illness usually spreads through droplets of saliva or mucus carried in the air for up to six feet or so when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viral particles may be breathed in, land on surfaces that people touch or be transferred when shaking hands or sharing a drink with someone who has the virus. Often it's obvious if a person is unwell. But there are cases where those who do not feel sick pass it on. Exactly how this happens - and how often - is not yet known. Regular handwashing and avoiding touching your mouth, nose and eyes are likely to help stop the spread of the virus. Quarantines and travel restrictions are now in place in many counties - including the US. COVID-19 is largely a respiratory virus. Common symptoms include a fever, dry coughing and trouble breathing. But there have been some reports of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. In some cases it can cause pneumonia and potentially be life-threatening. Most people who get sick will recover from COVID-19. Recovery time varies and, for people who are not severely ill, may be similar to the aftermath of flu. People with mild symptoms may recover within a few days. It may take weeks or even months for those who develop pneumonia. Prof Lessler added: ""An accurate estimate of the disease incubation period for a new virus makes it easier for epidemiologists to gauge the likely dynamics of the outbreak, and allows public health officials to design effective quarantine and other control measures. ""Quarantines typically slow and may ultimately stop the spread of infection, even if there are some outlier cases with incubation periods that exceed the quarantine period."" He pointed out isolating people in a way that prevents them from working has costs, both personal and societal, which is perhaps most obvious when health care workers and first responders such as firefighters are quarantined. Prof Lessler and colleagues have published an online tool that allows public health officials and members of the public to estimate how many cases would be caught and missed under different quarantine periods.

The patient from the Pennywell area of the city is currently in a coma after becoming the first person there diagnosed with the virus. ""I just hope she's not going to be the next one to die,"" her son said. Authorities confirmed the sixth coronavirus death in the UK this afternoon as the toll rises above 4,000 worldwide. Many victims are elderly with severe underlying health conditions. However, the Sunderland woman's son said her descent into a coma had frightened the family.  ""Apart from her knees, she's otherwise fit and healthy, so this has shocked us all,"" he told Chronicle Live. ""We thought she just had a cold and a bit of a chest infection, but on Thursday she was gasping for air and struggling to breathe so she went to hospital and by Friday it was much worse. ""We still just didn't even think it was the coronavirus though, as she doesn't even really leave the house. ""In fact the only time she's left the house in the last two weeks was to go to the doctors, so we don't know know how or where she got it."" He said two members of her family, who have asked not to be named, have been asked to self-isolate. He, as well as others, say they have been given the all-clear by Public Health England. The woman is currently in South Tyneside District Hospital and had her diagnosis made public on Monday evening. Her son said his mum was placed in an induced coma after her health rapidly deteriorated. He added: ""She is no better or worse, it is the machines that are pretty much keeping her alive at the moment. ""I think the staff are trying everything they can, but this is all so new, and so rare. ""It is scary to think 'where has this come from?' and I just hope that she's not going to be the next one to die."" It was the sixth confirmed case in Tyne and Wear to date and Gillian Gibson, director of Public Health at Sunderland City Council, said the authority was doing all it could to stop the virus spreading. ""While we still have a lot to learn about the virus, the advice from the UK Governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser is that for the vast majority of people who catch COVID-19, it will be a mild illness,"" she said. ""The best way anyone can protect themselves and others from the virus is to wash their hands thoroughly and often with soap and water, or use a hand sanitiser, and to cough or sneeze into a tissue, bin it and wash their hands."" While the number of British cases is expected to increase dramatically in the forthcoming weeks as the virus peaks, the outbreak has not yet reached its height in other worse-hit countries. Italy is in lockdown as it battles to contain the virus, while the number of coronavirus cases in Spain doubled. The woman's son is now pleading for the public to follow the Government's advice to try and curb the outbreaks - so that as few families as possible have to go through the ""nightmare"" they had endured over the last week. He said: ""People need to start cleaning their hands and washing themselves as the virus is out there now, and I think within the next week it will get really bad as how do you stop something that is invisible?"""
3,Meghan Markle's nod to Diana as she follows in footsteps and says goodbye to royal life,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markles-nod-diana-follows-21667993,"Meghan Markle and Princess Diana left the Royal Family in very different circumstances, but it was a turning point in both of their lives  The Duchess of Sussex channelled her mother-in-law Princess Diana as she followed in her footsteps and said her goodbyes to royal life .   The two women left the Firm in very different circumstances - with Meghan quitting alongside her husband Prince Harry while Diana was forced to step back after divorcing Charles - it was a life-changing moment for them both.  Meghan dazzled at her final royal engagement - the Commonwealth Day Service - wearing an emerald green Emilia Wickstead dress with an asymmetrical cape and hat by William Chambers. Many royal fans were quick to notice how similar her outfit was to one Diana wore to Trooping the Colour in June 1982, when she was pregnant with Prince William. Diana was just 22 at the time, and had not long joined the Royal Family. She wore a lose green dress in the same shade of green as Meghan's with a similar netted fascinator. Fans loved her colourful look and took to social media to praise the dress. One wrote: ""Ohhh right homage to Di!"" Another added: ""Love Diana and Meghan. Beautiful women!"" Fans also noticed something very sweet about Harry's outfit, a cute addition in the inside of his suit jacket. The dad looked smart in a blue suit with a matching tie and black shoes. The lining of his suit jacket was also emerald green, matching Meghan's dress perfectly. Fans were quick to praise Harry's outfit and celebrated his romantic nod to Meghan. The Westminster Abbey service was the first time Meghan and Harry have been seen publicly with their royal relatives, with the world's eyes watching how they would interact. The couple were not part of the Queen's procession, as they have been in recent years, instead taking their seats with the rest of the guest. In a last minute change, Kate and William also skipped the formality. The decision was made yesterday, after the order of services were printed. Meghan and Harry walked into the abbey hand in hand before taking their seats in the second row behind the Queen, Charles, Kate and William. Things appeared slightly awkward as the Sussexes met the Cambridges inside the abbey. Meghan was seen to mouth â€œhiâ€ and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a â€œhelloâ€, as the Cambridges took their seat in the High Altar in the row in front of the Sussexes.  After the service, Meghan and Harry appeared to keep their distance from Kate and William, as they met with guests including Anthony Joshua Â and Craig David. "

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were reunited with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on Sunday for the first time since they announced their decision to quit.  Beaming Meghan curtsied to the rest of the royal family, and greeted her sister-in-law Kate Middleton with a slightly uneasy wave for the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey. On today's This Morning, royal expert Camilla Tominey spoke about the ""tense and awkward"" body language between the Fab Four. But the most interesting insight came when Camilla explained that The Telegraph's lip reader had revealed what the royals had said to each other. Prince Harry told Meghan that his brother had only said two words when greeting him. Camilla explained: ""When Harry sits down he said to Meghan, â€˜he just said Hello Harry to me and that was itâ€™ and Meghan smiles.  ""But we donâ€™t know whether he was referring to William or, because he'd just been meeting dignitaries including Boris Johnson , so a bit of mystery on that.""  There were more gasps in the studio when Camilla revealed what Prince William is believed to have said to Kate. She continued: ""When William sat down, he turned to Kate and said, â€˜This whole handshaking thing is weird. Weâ€™re going to have to put a load of hand gel on after thisâ€™."" Phillip was left open-mouthed, while Holly shouted: ""No he didn't! That's fantastic."" Camilla also pointed out that there were notably no conversations despite being just one row apart. Phillip claimed there was some nice ""brotherly support"" from Prince William to Prince Harry as the Cambridges decided to walk in at the same time as the Sussexes and negate the formal ceremony. However, Holly confessed she did not understand why they didn't talk inside the Abbey while knowing the whole world would be watching. Phillip tried to defend them again, but Camilla added: ""They kept up appearances but at the end of the day the pretence now is over. They've flown back to Canada and we're starting this brave future without them."" While Vanessa Feltz admitted it was a ""damn shame"" that Prince Harry and Meghan did not bring Archie to the UK. She said: ""He could have played with his cousins. They could have broken the ice and seen the Queen. It's not like normal people, they have nannies. ""They could have brought Archie. It was mean not to."" *This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10am"
6,Dad on Universal Credit 'forced to pawn son's Playstation games to feed family',https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dad-universal-credit-forced-pawn-21495044,"EXCLUSIVE: Ian Sandeman says his family are roughly Â£300 worse off a week since they moved to Norfolk, Norwich and were placed on Universal Credit, meaning the family has to rely on food banks to survive  A dad claims he has been forced to pawn his ten-year-old son's video games to put food on the table after being placed on Universal Credit .  Since moving onto the new benefit system last year, Ian Sandeman says his family is roughly Â£300 worse off a week. The 65-year-old struggles to get food on the table for his four kids, often choosing to go hungry alongside his wife Kerry so their children can eat. Figures from the End Child Poverty Coalition show 38% of children in Norwich are living in poverty.  Our Give Me Five campaign wants an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lift 200,000 children out of destitution.  We also want the Government to restore child tax credits, to scrap the two-child limit and to axe the benefit cap.  Are you a parent struggling with poverty? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk  Ian says that while his 12, 10, six and five-year-old kids are ""very understanding"" about the family's financial situation, it's difficult to see them going without. ""We used to take the children out more and treat them to meals at Pizza Hut and McDonaldâ€™s,"" the dad from Norwich, Norfolk explained. ""Now we struggle to make meals that are basic. Quite often we have gone days without main meals. Some days itâ€™s just toast. ""Our 10-year-old-boy Robert who is autistic likes to get games for his PlayStation but sometimes we have to pawn it to have enough money at the end of the month . ""Other times we've had to pawn things like phones, game consoles and jewellery. It becomes an expensive way to borrow money. ""It's an incredibly expensive way of getting credit but we can't borrow money other ways because we've been in debt."" Ian says his and Kerry's financial troubles began last year when they moved from Suffolk to their current home. Their change of address meant they were automatically taken off the old benefit system and placed onto Universal Credit. Previously, Kerry's disability allowance for her severe spinal injures that leave her bed bound, along with Ian's carer's allowance, were enough for the family to live on. But Ian claims their household income has fallen by about Â£1,200 a month after they were moved onto Universal Credit and he was judged fit to work at a tribunal. Ian, who used to work as an instrument technician for the Atomic Energy Authority, is currently waiting at the back of a 12 month queue for a court date so he can appeal the decision. ""When we had to move it all went wrong,"" he explained. ""I estimate weâ€™ve lost about Â£300 per week because of the governments changes to benefits."" The financial hit has had a huge impact on the family and the way they live their lives. Ian said: ""We're having to go to food banks. We never went to them before, but we need to to feed our children - they're obviously our priority. ""You feel as if you're going begging [going to the food bank]. It doesn't make you feel very nice at all. ""We go short of the basic consumables. Bread, milk. butter, tea, coffee. We can't afford them every week. ""It's difficult to get by without a cup of tea. We would always feed the kids first. We always do. it's a case of getting something for the children.""  * Read more about our Give Me Five campaign  The change in their financial circumstance has also put a huge strain on their mental health. ""I don't see any end to it at the foreseeable future,"" Ian said. ""I start my pension on Friday. But because of that we don't know what the situation will be with universal credit. ""It worries my wife no end. It has a very poor affect on her health. ""She had had anti-depressant tablets from her doctors, but she has a very difficult time with it."" The DWP has been given the opportunity to comment."
7,Everything your employer must do to protect you from coronavirus,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/coronavirus-everything-your-employer-must-21622161,"Employers have been told they'll have to pay workers who have to self-isolate due to coronavirus symptoms - which means most of those affected will be paid for any sickness leave. Here are your rights The coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, has spread to at leastÂ 65 countriesÂ - with more than 300 cases now confirmed in the UK. Governments have shut borders and imposed quarantines, and now airlines have imposed travel bans in a bid to mitigate the impact of the fast-spreading illness. Employers have also been told they'll have to pay workers who have to self-isolate - which means most of those affected will be paid for any sickness leave. In cases where employers do not offer sick pay, workers will be entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks, from day one. This amounts to Â£94.25 per week and is paid from the fourth day of sickness. But what should employers be doing to safeguard workers - and should they be providing materials for staff to work from home? Firms must ensure that all workers are updated with potential symptoms of the virus and affected areas so that they can be vigilant. They should seek guidance on what can be done to minimise the risk of spreading the virus - and provide staff with the resources to help manage it, ie. tissues and hand sanitisers. This includes considering whether staff can work from home - and providing them with the resources and capabilities to do so. We asked Mini Setty, a partner in employment law at Langleys Solicitors, for some advice on what workers can expect from their employer as the illness continues to spread globally. We've also got a full guide on coronavirus sick pay rights, here. If you've had to take time off work for childcare, here's what you need to know on coronavirus school closures. EmployersÂ have a duty of care in the workplace under health and safety laws. This obligation means thatÂ theyÂ must ensure that the workplace is safe for employees to work in at all times. In the currentÂ coronavirusÂ pandemic, employers are being recommended to: Send guidance to staff on the best ways to stop the spread of theÂ virus Provide tissues and hand sanitisers for staff to use Monitor whether work-trips to areas hit by theÂ virusÂ should proceed Ensure that anyone who comes back from an infected area does not come in to work if they are symptomatic Consider the safety issues of â€˜high riskâ€™ individuals such as the older people, those with underlying medical conditions and pregnant women If an employee on a work trip is stuck abroad, the employer should consider whether the staff member can continue to work remotely. If so, they should be paid as normal. If working remotely is not a possibility, thenÂ employersÂ will need to consider whether to grant leave as: unpaid, sick leave or paid. This involves considering any contractual rights and policies that may be in place at theÂ employer. Those returning from high-risk areas may have to self-isolate even if they areÂ not symptoamatic. Those returning from other areas who areÂ symptomaticÂ should also self-isolate.Â EmployersÂ should treat such employees as being off sick and pay according to their normal rules on sick pay. This is a matter for eachÂ employer who will have to assess whether self-isolation is necessary. If the worker has to self-isolate, they will be paid for the time off. If the employee is able to work from home, then theÂ employerÂ will be able to pay as normal. EmployersÂ must act reasonably in their dealings and if employees wish to travel to areas where flights are still being run as normal, it will be difficult to justifying imposing a blanket travel ban. To do so will risk employees becoming secretive about their holiday plans andÂ employersÂ could also face adverse publicity and even claims as set out below. Firms are being advised to make their rules on this clear - and to ensure workers are aware of the risks involved. EmployersÂ should be mindful of hysteria around this subject and should proceed with caution when faced by an employee refusing to attend work. It is advisable to discuss their concerns, reassure them on the measures being taken but ultimately to remind them that they could face disciplinary action if their continued refusal to attend work is unreasonable."
8,Toddler bullied by cruel trolls over rare skin condition which 'makes him look yellow',https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/toddler-bullied-cruel-trolls-over-21667079,"Logan Webb, one, suffers from Alagille syndrome, which makes his skin turn yellow and has led to cruel strangers saying he looks like Shrek. The parents of a one-year-old boy with a rare skin condition are so distraught by cruel trolls they avoid going out in public. Toddler Logan Webb has Alagille syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes liver damage and bile to be absorbed by the body and makes his skin turn yellow. His mum Gemma Channing, 25, and dad Lloyd Webb, 27, say his appearance makes it impossible to have a normal day out and that rude strangers have even called him a ""minion baby"". Others have told the couple, from Exeter, that he looks jaundiced, or like Shrek or the Grinch. ""I always have people asking me what's wrong with him and that I should take him to hospital because he has jaundice,"" Gemma says. ""We get lots of people saying negative things such as asking why he looks like a minion and that he looks like Shrek or the Grinch. ""Every time we go out as a family there's a constant reminder about Logan's condition. ""We can't just leave the house and have a normal day out, we have to be stopped and reminded by someone about how poorly he is."" On one occasion, a stranger even insisted that Gemma should immediately take her son to hospital. ""We were in Sainsbury's with Logan doing a quick food shop and minding our own business,"" she explains. ""We got into the car and were about to drive off when a woman started banging on the window. ""Rather than asking us about Logan she had called a paramedic who happened to be in the car park to assess Logan. ""She then proceeded to tell us that we should take Logan to the hospital as he was clearly unwell. ""We tried to explain to her that he is being cared for and has a complex condition. ""She just stood there and said it if was her son she'd take him to hospital. ""The paramedic understood what we were saying but it was so embarrassing. ""We have horrible comments and questions whenever we leave the house. Sometimes it just breaks your heart."" Logan was diagnosed with Alagille syndrome soon after he was born in December 2018. His parents have to give him a daily dosage of 10 different medications, as the condition means his liver doesn't function properly and that his blood is only half oxygenated. Because his liver can't process the bile in his body, it becomes absorbed into his skin, causing burning and itching as well as turning his skin yellow. His heart and liver defects also mean Logan can't absorb food properly, so he is still only the size of a six-month-old baby even at the age of one. The youngster is constantly in and out of hospital, which can be a traumatic ordeal, Gemma says. ""He can't stop crying, he's very frightened of adults because he automatically assumes he'll get a needle. ""He's phobic of people and that puts a lot of strain on the family."" But despite the hospital visits and pain and discomfort caused by his condition, Gemma says that brave Logan never ceases to amaze her with his happy smile. ""He touches the heart of everyone he meets,"" she said. ""He's so happy and he's got such a lovely, little character. ""He's always shouting and giggling, he takes it all in his stride and he loves life.""  Gemma and Lloyd are now trying to raise Â£2,000 on GoFundMe to pay for Logan to travel to California to see an Alagille syndrome specialist.  It is hoped he can have open heart surgery before he goes onto the list for a liver transplant."
9,Airlines cancel thousands of Italy flights because of coronavirus - is your holiday affected?,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-airlines-cancel-thousands-italy-21666220,"Here's the latest coronavirus travel advice as Ryanair suspends flights to Italy and joins British Airways in offering refunds but Easyjet continues to operate to some destinations Thousands of flights to Italy have been cancelled by airlines today with the nation in the midst of a huge coronavirus lockdown. British Airways, Ryanair and Wizz have all shut off their routes to Italy for several weeks, after the Foreign Office warned against all but essential advice. But some Brits due to fly out for holidays to Italy this week are still set to lose money. EasyJet has cancelled flights to northern Italy but other routes are still running. It currently is not planning to refund or rebook customers on existing flights to Italy that haven't been cancelled.  Ryanair had initially also refused to refund customers but this afternoon annonced it was suspending flights to Italy and offering refunds in some cases.  But the airline's decision has left some travellers with holidays booked this week in the lurch - as they learn the refunds only kick in from Friday despite Italy being in lockdown. Italy is under blanket quarantine conditions as authorities working to contain the virus grapple with a rising death toll in the country. The Foreign Office has warned Brits against all but essential travel to Italy as the outbreak takes its grip. Travel chaos is in store for Brits are left wondering what to do, as many flights between the UK and Italy are being cancelled while others are continuing to operate. Ryanair had earlier told customers whose flights are running that ""the no cancellation and no refund policy remains"". However at lunchtime today the airline issued a fresh statement revising its position. The airline said it will be suspending Italian domestic flights from midnight on Wednesday March 11, and all Italian international flights from midnight on Friday March 13. The airline said that affected passengers have been contacted by email regarding the cancellations.  As for passengers looking for repatriation, Ryanair is offering a free move to an earlier one of its flights operating until midnight on Friday March 13.  Affected passengers will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next 12 months. But travellers who had holidays booked for this week have been left with no option of a refund if they don't want to travel. Londoner David Lawrence and his girlfriend have a Ryanair flight booked to travel to Venice for Thursday for a trip they planned to celebrate their third anniversary together. Ryanair's new stance on Italy flights announced this afternoon leave the couple's trip falling just outside the airline's offer for affected travellers by a single day. Mr Lawrence told the Mirror Online had already spent more than an hour on hold to the airline this morning in hopes of finding a solution, but said his hopes were fading with just days before they were due to fly. He said: ""Itâ€™s absolutely ridiculous. How can you continue to run flights to a country on lockdown without offering a refund? ""To some extent you know what you are getting in to when you book with a low-cost airline but this is way beyond the line. Scandalous.â€ He said the couple's flights with the budget airline had cost about Â£90, but it was the principle of the matter that left them feeling frustrated as he said other travel operators had acted fairly. Mr Lawrence said the couple's Airbnb host in Florence had offered the couple a full refund even before north Italy's quarantine extended to the rest of the country. Airbnb had also waived its fees, Mr Lawrence said. The situation in Italy has brought fresh travel chaos after struggling airline Flybe folded last week, partly blaming the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on its plight. The position some airlines are taking mean customers who have not booked a package trip, bought travel insurance or have had their flight cancelled face a choice between either travelling against Foreign Office advice, or staying at home and losing their air fare. EasyJet has grounded most of its flights to and from northern Italy but is continuing to serve locations such as Milan, Venice and Bologna.  It is advising customers who do not want to fly that they would only be due a refund of ""any government tax you may have paid"". Some other airlines are offering a range of options to their customers whose plans are affected by the situation in Italy. British Airways is allowing passengers booked to travel on flights to and from northern Italy up to April 4 can rebook to a later date up until the end of May, or they can move their destination toÂ GenevaÂ or Zurich, or receive a full refund. An estimated three million Brits travel to Italy every year. The Foreign Office is warning against all but essential travel to the country due to the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus, and the strict quarantine conditions there. Brits remain able to depart Italy without restriction, however travellers are being warned that flights are being cancelled. The Government advice for anyone returning to the UK from Italy in the last 14 days is to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, even if they do not have symptoms of the coronavirus.  Those who are yet to travel to the country are being urged to start seeking information on what steps to take - our latest travel advice for Italy can be found here. Anyone who has booked flights or accommodation directly should contact their airline and accommodation provider to see what flexibility they are offering. They should also check their travel insurance as it may cover non-refundable cancellation costs for trips to Italy and other affected countries where the FCO is advising against all but essential travel during the virus outbreak. Under current rules, travel insurers aren't obliged to pay out if the passenger changes their mind about a destination that hasn't been warned against by the FCO.  You can read more on your travel insurance rights here. Anyone imminently due to visit Italy on a package holiday should be offered alternative arrangements by their travel provider, and should be able to obtain a full refund if there are no suitable options.Â  If a tour operator refuses, customers may be entitled to compensation under the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements 2018 regulations. Despite the panic, travel trade organisation Abta is warning holidaymakers against prematurely canning their summertime trips. Its spokesperson said: ""It is too early"" to say that summer holidays cannot go ahead as planned. ""If you cancel early you may have to pay cancellation charges,"" Abta warned.  If you're feeling anxious about your upcoming travel during the coronavirus outbreak, here are some hygiene trips for air travel.  You can check the latest FCO advice for Italy here . "

Malcolm Harrison, 41, came up with the scam after spotting the faulty path on his daily run. He returned to the path later the same day to hit his leg on the broken slab five times. But bungling Harrison did not realise CCTV cameras on a block of flats in Brecon, Powys, were recording him. Footage showed him laughing with a neighbour as he repeatedly banged his leg against the paving stone. He claimed Â£6,000 for knee and ankle ligament damage from the housing association which owns the flats. But they refused to pay up and alerted police after watching the bizarre CCTV footage back. Prosecutor Paul Hobson told Merthyr Tydfil crown court that the broken slab â€œprompted an ideaâ€ from Harrison. â€œHe returned and deliberately banged his knee on the broken slab five times,â€ he said â€œMr Harrison can be seen later in the CCTV hopping on one leg and limping. â€œHe didnâ€™t know that what had happened was caught on CCTV - he was aware of the security cameras but thought they were dummies.â€ Harrison admitted a Â£9,680 fraud which included the housing associationâ€™s legal expenses. He was given a two-year community order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work with costs of Â£1,000."
11,Savvy mum left housebound for week by flooding transforms 'time warp' kitchen for Â£68,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/savvy-mum-left-housebound-week-21665943,"Stranded at home for a week by flooding, mum Sam Walters decided it was past time to get her kitchen up to scratch - and the results left family ""gobsmacked"" even though she spent less than Â£100 on the job A mum from Shrewsbury has managed to completely revamp her 'time wap' kitchen for just Â£68. Sam Waters, 29, was left housebound for more than a week by flooding, and decided to do the job herself after being quoted more than Â£10,000 to get a new kitchen installed. So - with a little help from husband Will their three-year-old son Artie - she got to work using bargains from eBay and Wilko along with some inspiration from Facebook to complete the transformation. ""The house was built in the 60s and it's only had one owner since then so it hadn't changed at all - it was just like a time warp,"" Sam, originally from South Wales, said. ""We had to do lots of work on it and decorated the bedrooms first because they were quite easy to do."" But they paused when it came to the kitchen. ""We were quoted Â£7,000 to Â£10,000 - we didn't really have the money for that so I just gave up on the idea and thought we'd never be able to redo the kitchen,"" Sam explained. ""But I've been housebound from all the flooding in Shrewsbury so I decided to do about two or three hours on the kitchen every day, in between looking after my son Artie."" Sam said that it was the biggest job she'd taken on so far herself. ""I've done a bit of DIY before in carpentry as a hobby over Christmas but I've never done anything on my own home before,"" she explained. ""My dad made sure he taught me how to put up shelves and change a tyre when I was younger - I like to think I'm quite handy!  ""I joined a DIY group on Facebook where I got lots of inspiration from people who were literally just giving cupboards a lick of paint, and it changed the whole room, so I thought I'd give it a go myself.  ""I also enjoy going around show homes and getting inspiration, and I referred to lots of pictures before I went to Wilkos to get some paint. ""With a little painting help from Will and Artie, it took me about six half-days to complete."" After gutting and cleaning the kitchen to create a fresh canvas, Sam first took all the cupboards off and sanded them down ready for paint, as before they had a high-gloss finish. She then used sugar soap to rid the cupboards of a thick yellow layer of nicotine, as the previous owner was a smoker, and painted them all with a pot of grey paint from Wilko, costing Â£12.  Sam bought all the new cupboard handles for just Â£18 on eBay , and screwed them to each of the ten cupboards and drawers after the paint had dried.  To whitewash the once yellow tinged walls and tiles, she used a tin of Â£8 paint from Wilko, and some white wood paint for the kitchen window. The tiled area around the cooker was created with a Â£10 roll of vinyl from B&Q, which she also used to wrap recycled shelves from the original kitchen. But her main task was finding a use for a particularly strange built-in cupboard, which is placed inside the wall across from the main kitchen units. Teacher Sam said: ""There's a cupboard where the old boiler vent used to be, no one could figure out what it was for when we moved in. ""It's the reason why the professional quotes were so high because if we had it knocked down there would need to be a strong structure put in place to brace the ceiling. ""So I just thought, why don't we turn it into a kitchen cupboard? ""I sanded and painted the inside, whitewashed the brick effect wall and added two shelves inside which cost Â£20 - it now stores all our pots on and pans. ""Recycling old stuff from your house is easier to do than you think!"" Overall, Sam spent just Â£68 on the transformation, and has received rave reviews from her family and others online, after posting it on Facebook. Sam added: ""I did a big reveal of the kitchen for my mum and she was gobsmacked. ""I can't believe how popular the Facebook post became - it just makes me feel proud of my work. ""People keep asking me where I got the tiles from but they're just the old ones that have been painted over. ""I absolutely love the kitchen now and don't feel the need to pay any more money on it. ""My next project will be the kitchen floor, which I will probably use vinyl on. ""If the weather was good, I would have been re-doing the garden, but being stuck in my house meant that I managed to transform my kitchen because of the floods!"""

Oh, itâ€™s me"": Tom Jones says he doesnâ€™t recognise himself in the mirror any more as he approaches 80th birthday",https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/tom-jones-says-doesnt-recognise-21663283,"Sir Tom Jones has revealed how he stays fit and healthy ahead of his milestone 80th birthday this year  Sir Tom Jones may be 79, but he neither looks, feels nor acts his age, hitting the gym daily to pound on the cross trainer listening to his favourite workout track, Great Balls Of Fire.  And the Welsh singing legend is my, my, my delightful when he talks about his big 80th birthday, coming up on June 7. He says: â€œIâ€™m not there yet, so I donâ€™t count my chickens. But 80, my God, I canâ€™t believe it. When I go to the toilet for the third time during the night, I look in the mirror and go, â€˜Whoâ€™s that old b*****d in there? And I go, â€˜Oh, itâ€™s meâ€™.â€ Tomâ€™s singing career began in the 1960s, when he had hits with Delilah, Itâ€™s Not Unusual and Whatâ€™s New Pussycat?. And almost 60 years on, he has a three-month tour kicking off in May, and is currently on telly as a coach on ITV talent show The Voice. Tom says: â€œI donâ€™t feel anything like my age. Itâ€™s only when you look in the mirror, you canâ€™t get around it. Youâ€™re getting older and thatâ€™s it. But, the way I feel, thank God, I donâ€™t have anything major. â€œMy health is good and I love life and I love to sing. I get everything checked out, you know what I mean? Some fellas are a little shy to go. Itâ€™s such a simple bloody thing, to check the prostate.â€  He tells how he urged pal Jimmy Tarbuck to get tested. Tom says: â€œI said, â€˜Go and get it checked. Youâ€™ll regret  it if something happensâ€™.â€  Comic Jimmy, 80, is now having treatment for prostate cancer, and Tom says: â€œJimmy says, â€˜Youâ€™ve saved my lifeâ€™.â€ Tomâ€™s wife Linda died, aged 75, in April 2016, from lung cancer. They had been married 59 years and have a son, Mark. Tom says: â€œOnce cancer gets a hold of you, youâ€™re in trouble. I saw that with my wife, God bless her, with lung cancer.â€ Now living in London, Tom made a New Yearâ€™s resolution to go to the gym daily. He says: â€œMy favourite is the cross trainer â€“ it hits a lot of places at once. I can listen to music and go for it. I do at least 30 minutes. I try to up the resistance every time.â€ So, what does Tom Jones have on his gym playlist? He says: â€œI always go to 50s rock and roll â€“ Jerry Lewis, Little Richard, Elvis, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry. When in doubt Great Balls of Fire. Thatâ€™s it.â€ He hopes to continue working on The Voice for some time. He says: â€œI love doing it and have the energy, so why not? Thereâ€™s no dog acts, or jugglers. This is about singing, which hopefully I know something about.â€ Tom is unsure how he will celebrate turning 80, but has a concert the night before in Cardiff. He says: â€œIâ€™ll have a few drinks. I try not to drink as much as I used to. But once in a while is fine. I still canâ€™t believe it will be my 80th birthday.â€"
13,Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder's final drug test results confirmed,https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-deontay-wilders-final-21668396,"The Gypsy King and the Bronze Bomber have received the results from the drug tests taken for their rematch last month - which Fury won by TKO to set up a trilogy fight this July  The World Boxing Council (WBC) have released the drug test results for Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder after the pair's bout last month.  The Voluntary Anti-Doping Association [VADA] carried out the tests, which were regulated by the WBC's Clean Boxing Program. And now the results have been confirmed after Fury produced a stunning display to beat the Bronze Bomber by TKO in the seventh round and claim the WBC heavyweight title. Both fighters passed all their tests, with the WBC confirming in a statement that: ""World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, and Deontay Wilder, came out clean in the doping tests conducted by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association as part of the successful Clean Boxing Program. ""We want to thank both warriors and their respective teams for their willingness to sign up for the Clean Boxing Program and demonstrate that they are both exemplary athletes, who testify to their honesty and commitment to boxing."" Fury will now face Wilder in a trilogy fight in July after the American activated a contract clause to extend his rivalry with the Gypsy King to a third bout. The first fight between the two heavyweights ended in a sensational draw in December 2018 before Fury forced Wilder's corner to throw in the towel during the rematch last month.  If Fury wins the third fight this summer, he could be in line for a unification super-fight with Anthony Joshua to determine the undisputed heavyweight champion.  With Fury wearing WBC gold and AJ boasting the other three major belts - the WBA, WBO and IBF - the fight would be one of the biggest heavyweight bouts ever. However, Joshua also has a summer fight planned. The Brit will face Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 20 June - so a proposed fight with Fury at the end of the year is likely to be dependant on both men coming through the summer victorious."
16,'I was caught up in love triangle - then one of my lovers murdered the other',https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-caught-up-love-triangle-21666126,"Natalie Strickland was ""shell-shocked"" when she found out her lover Tom Jones was dead. He had been stabbed 32 times before his body was set on fire When Natalie Strickland was sleeping with two men, as well as her husband, she says each of them gave her something different. ""One was passion and physical attraction, one was friendship and fun, one stability and familiarity"", she said. But the affairs ended in heartbreak when one of her lovers murdered the other in a chilling revenge attack.  Natalie was having secret affairs with both Alan Maidment, 40, and Tom Jones, 47 â€“ at the same time as she was sleeping with her husband.  But after Jones attacked Natalie, Maidment murdered him in revenge, stabbing him repeatedly before setting his body on fire.   Maidment was jailed for life without parole in October 2017.   And an independent review, published this week, has found that lessons from the case could still be learned.   Natalie, 41,Â from Salford,Â says: â€œI actually introduced the two men to each other and I feel so guilty.  â€œI never set out to sleep with them all at the same time; it was just circumstance. They all lived so close and it was amazing that I got away with it. â€œEach lover brought me something different; one was passion and physical attraction, one was friendship and fun, one stability and familiarity.   â€œI was arrested on suspicion of murder after Tomâ€™s death and in court, Alan even tried to blame me himself.   â€œI didnâ€™t know about the review but it has brought all the trauma back to me.   â€œI am very lucky in that my husband has supported me and Iâ€™m back living in the family home. I hope we can work this out.  â€œBut the flat where Tom died is across the road and so I see it, every time I leave the house. Itâ€™s a constant reminder. Iâ€™ve had a backlash from the community too, some people somehow blame me. Itâ€™s been a struggle to cope, and this review brings it all back.â€  Natalie was on a temporary split from her husband, Paul, when she met Alan Maidment in July 2016.  Natalie says: â€œPaul and I had been together for eighteen years, mostly happy. But I was drinking too much and we went through a rocky patch. We decided on a break and I met Alan, firstly just as a friend, but then we got closer.â€   At the start of 2017, Natalie believed she needed a fresh start and moved into her own place, around the corner from her husband.   Alan moved away and she began seeing a neighbour, Tom Jones.  She says: â€œWe were just friends at first. My relationship with Alan petered out because I hardly saw him. He lived around 40 minutes away.   â€œOne night, after a few drinks, I ended up in bed with Tom and from then on, we started sleeping together. We werenâ€™t in a serious relationship; more friends with benefits. We shared a flat and we shared a bed.   â€œI knew it wasnâ€™t the best situation but I certainly didnâ€™t think it would lead to his death.â€   Alan then decided to move closer to Natalie â€“ and got a flat just a few streets away.  Natalie says: â€œAlan didnâ€™t know I had been sleeping with Tom. He moved in near me and our relationship resumed. I didnâ€™t know how to tell him about Tom so I just kept quiet.  â€œI was sleeping with both men.â€   Natalie also slept with her husband during that time, in an attempt to rescue her marriage.  She says: â€œI was very confused; I didnâ€™t know what I wanted. I had three men, all living within a few streets of each other, who all wanted to be with me.  â€œOne brought me passion, one gave me friendship, the other stability. I felt like I got something special from each of them.   â€œAlan was passionate and dangerous; he was a brilliant lover. Tom was friendly and fun, he made me laugh and we got on so well. My husband was familiar and we had such a lot of history together.   â€œI suppose it was flattering but more than anything, I didnâ€™t want to hurt anyone. I was worried about hurting their feelings.  â€œBut I couldnâ€™t even nip to the shop without bumping into one of them. I had to be very careful.â€  ThatÂ Christmas, Natalie decided to end the relationship with Alan, but agreed that they would remain friends. She also agreed with her husband that they would separate formally and their relationship ended.   She says: â€œI had decided to choose Tom. I hoped the others would understand.â€  But in March 2017, Natalie and Tom had a huge row. HeÂ allegedlyÂ beat her up and was arrested.  Natalie says: â€œIt was a huge shock. Tom had never hurt me before. He was arrested and I went to hospital. For me, it was over.   â€œAfterwards, I went to stay with a female friend.â€   The following morning, Natalie was arrested on suspicion of murdering Tom, 47.   She says: â€œI was shell-shocked. Iâ€™d had no idea that Tom was even dead. To learn he had been murdered was heart-breaking.â€  Officers at first thought that Natalie had murdered Tom herself, in revenge for the attack on her. But she was released without charge after questioning.   The following day, Alan Maidment was charged with Tomâ€™s murder.   Natalie says: â€œI was stunned. As far as Iâ€™d known there was no problem between Alan and Tom â€“ their only connection was me. I couldnâ€™t help feeling guilty â€“ responsible for Tomâ€™s death.   â€œAlan had murdered Tom on my behalf â€“ as revenge. It was sickening.   â€œTom deserved punishment for hitting me, but he did not deserve such a brutal death.â€   Alan Maidment appeared before Manchester crown CourtÂ in October 2017.   The court was told that Mr Jones was stabbed 32 times before his body was set on fire.   The court heard Maidment acted in â€˜revengeâ€™ after hearing of what had apparently happened to Natalie, who it was said he still occasionally had sex with despite splitting up earlier in the year.  The court was told that Mr Jones was arrested by police in connection with the alleged assault, but was released after Natalie stated she did not wish to press charges.   Mr Jones had accused Natalie, who he had an on-off sexual relationship with while living in separate rooms of his flat, of sleeping with other men.   Maidment initially confessed to police, saying he had committed the murder in revenge after hearing that Mr Jones had assaulted Natalie.   He then claimed that former girlfriend Natalie, and a friend Stewart Hutchinson, in fact conspired to kill Mr Jones.   But Maidment was found guilty of murdering Tom Jones after trial and earlier pleaded guilty to five counts of robbery and possession of a bladed weapon. These offences were committed whilst he was on the run after murdering Mr Jones.  Maidment, 40, was jailed for life without parole after it was heard that he was already a convicted killer and had been released from prison the previous year for killing 72-year-old Paul Carlson â€“ also in a perceived revenge attack.   Jailing Maidment, Judge David Stockdale QC said: â€œThe striking similarities between the brutal killings of Paul Carlson and Thomas Jones are all too obvious. This was a cold-blooded, premeditated act of execution.â€   And an independent review, of the internal serious case review by Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, this week made six key recommendations.   Naomi Ibbs, a senior consultant for Niche, a health and social care specialist, said the trustâ€™s report may have been limited, as Maidmentâ€™s criminal trial was still ongoing.   But she added: â€œIt is our opinion that were two additional potential lines of enquiry.â€   The first was a time gap in 2016 between Maidment being referred by his GP on July 13 for treatment and his eventual assessment by a community health team on September 15.   And the other question raised was concerning how comprehensive an assessment of Maidment was by a community mental health worker as part of the process.   The expert came up with six recommendations, including one stressing that any service users with a conviction for murder should be the subject of multi-disciplinary team reviews while out on licence.   She also criticised trust reviewers for failing to identify any specific care or service delivery problems with the case.

17,Kate Middleton's kind gesture to help 'defuse' tension between Meghan Markle and Queen,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/kate-middletons-kind-gesture-help-21665412,"Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton were both guests at the Commonwealth Day Service along with their husbands, but it wasn't the happy reunion we all hoped for The Fab Four were back together yesterday, but it wasn't the happy reunion we were all hoping for.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came face-to-face with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry publicly for the first time since the Sussexes announced their plans to quit the Royal Family.  But Meghan and Harry's final outing - the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey - was reportedly marred by tensions behind the scenes. The couple were said to be ""upset and emotional"" after learning they couldn't be part of the Queen's procession at the start of the service, instead being shown to their seats with the rest of the the guests.  But in a bid to avoid any more drama, Prince William and Kate made a last minute change to try and ease the tension, reports the Daily Mail .  The couple offered to join Meghan and Harry in skipping the procession, meaning they all waited for the service to start in their seats. The decision was only made on Sunday, after the order of services were printing - meaning they were incorrect. However their gesture reportedly didn't work, and their meeting seemed slightly awkward as both couples took their seats. The Sussexes arrived first and sat in the second row. The Cambridges were shortly behind them, but Meghan and Harry didn't stand to greet them. Last year Meghan and Kate greeted each other with a kiss on each cheek, but they seemed more reserved yesterday. While it wouldn't have been possible for them to kiss, the two couples exchanged only one or two words as they waited for the Queen and Prince Charles to arrive. Meghan, who was already sitting down, can be seen saying ""hello"" and giving an awkward wave. Harry also says hello, but that was as far of their conversation went, with Harry turning to talk to his wife. Sophie Wessex, who is sitting behind Kate, leaned forward to chat to the Duchess, while Harry and Meghan chatted to Prince Edward. There had been rumours of a rift between the two couples in the months leading up to Meghan and Harry announcing their intention to step down, These were fueled when the couple scrapped their plans to live at Kensington Palace, just a few doors down from the Cambridges, and moved to Windsor instead. William and his dad Prince Charles were reportedly ""incandescent with rage"" when they were sent their announcement just 10 minutes before it was shared with the world."

There are currently 765 cases of the virus in the US and 26 people have died from it. In Italy, the numbers are far more alarming. As of Tuesday morning,463 have died and there are9,172 of it.Italy confirmed its first case of the virus 11 days before the US did. On Monday night, computer scientist Mark Handley,Professor of Networked Systems and part-time Roboticist at UCL in London, tweeted a graph showing how growth figures in other infected countries compare to Italy's. 'Everyone else will be Italy in 9-14 days time,' Handley tweeted along with the data. According to his data, the US is on par with Italy's growth for the number of days since the first infection. The situation in Italy is so bad, some doctors have reported becoming 'overwhelmed' and crying because they cannot stop people from dying and are being forced to choose 'who to save'. President Trump adamantly stated on Monday during the day that nothing in the country was shutting down or failing due to the virus, despite financial chaos that brought Wall Street its worst day since 2008, a mass of school closures and growing number of diagnoses across the country. Scroll down for video On Monday night, he conceded that the stock exchange chaos had 'blindsided' him but still urged people not to panic. Trump later announced an economic bailout plan which would help alleviate the immediate damage of the crisis. It was well received by Wall Street: the Dow rebounded by 830 points on Tuesday morning after a disastrous day on Monday which saw the worst single-day point drop ever. But on Tuesday, he demanded another interest rate cut and said called the Federal Reserve 'pathetic' despite starting talks on emergency tax cuts to answer the coronavirus crisis. The SEC became the first federal agency to tell people to work from home on Tuesday. Trump'snon-alarmist tone was echoed on Tuesday morning by Surgeon General Jerome Adams who, despite warning that 100million Americans may become infected and saying the scenario will 'get worse before it gets better', told Americans not to panic. Adams was asked whether the US should prepare for an outbreak as large as 100million people during an appearance on Good Morning America. He said: 'Americans should absolutely be prepared but that doesn't mean they should be afraid. 'Weâ€™ve been here before- SARS, MRSA â€“ we know how to handle this. 'There are things we can do to prepare and not panic.' He went on: 'Initially we had a containment poster, thatâ€™s outward facingâ€¦ that works when you know when theyâ€™re coming from. 'Originally, over 95% of cases were coming from China.Now, most are coming from Europe, Iran, South Koreaâ€¦ weâ€™re looking at mitigation. 'Mitigation means within your community, how do you lower the impact of the virus and prevent it from spreading. Italian hospitals are so 'overwhelmed' by coronavirus that strokes are going untreated and elderly patients are not even being assessed, a doctor at the centre of the crisis has said - while another medic said people should be panicking more. Doctors in Italy have been forced into life-or-death decisions over who should receive intensive care, with virus cases piling up around the country. A medic in northern Italy told a friend in the UK that hospitals were running at '200 per cent capacity' with operating theatres hurriedly converted into intensive care units. Non-coronavirus cases are being sidelined with some medics being given a 'leaflet' and told to perform specialist tasks for which they are not qualified, while some patients over 65 are not even being assessed, the doctor said. The medic's comments were published in a Twitter thread by UK-based friend Jason van Schoor, an anaesthetist and clinical fellow at University College London. The doctor also issued a warning for the UK, saying that the Italian chaos would repeat itself in Britain 'if you don't take it seriously'. His warning was echoed by a second doctor who suggested people should be more scared, saying that overzealous warnings to remain calm meant 'the danger of what is happening does not reach people'. Van Schoor said he was passing on a message from a 'well-respected' friend who worked as an intensive care medic and A&E consultant in northern Italy. 'The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all,' the unnamed medic told Mr van Schoor. 'Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19 [the disease caused by coronavirus], they are running 200 per cent capacity. 'We've stopped all routine, all operating rooms have been converted to intensive care units and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. 'There are hundreds of patients with severe respiratory failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask. 'Patients above 65, or younger with comorbidities, are not even assessed by [intensive care], I am not saying not tubed, I'm saying not assessed.' The medic added: 'Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed. 'My friends call me in tears because they see people dying in front of them and they con only offer some oxygen.' The medic added that Lombardy, the area of northern Italy at the centre of the crisis, was 'the most developed region in Italy and has extraordinary good healthcare'. 'Don't make the mistake to think that what is happening is happening in a third world country,' they said. â€˜School closures, pulling down large social gatherings, those are all steps that folks should be thinking about in case they have an outbreak in their community. 'Not every community has a cluster right now but people should know this is likely going to get worse before it gets better.' The entire country of Italy is now in lock-down, with the Prime Minister canceling mass gatherings and sporting events until the virus clears. He called it the country's 'darkest hour'. European airlines are canceling all flights to the country.Some US airlines are now following suit but there are still concerns over the level of screening passengers are getting when they arrive back in the US from Italy. Some say they are not being checked at all or are being asked few questions. Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday morning that the city would not be shutting down due to 'undue fear' but that he could not rule out a lockdown in the future. 'We cannot shut down because of undue fear. 'I would advise against these mass closures when weâ€™re keeping this situation relatively contained. 'Ask me in a week, ask me in a month - it might change,' he added during an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Trump and border officials have insisted that people traveling back to the US from Italy are being screened for the virus, despite contradictory accounts from travelers. The only people who are physically being banned from entering the US as a result of the virus are foreign nationals arriving to the US on flights from China or Iran. US citizens or people with valid visas who have been in China or Iran in the last 14 days are being redirected for screening, then they will have restrictions on their movements depending on their conditions. Air Canada will allow travelers to rebook flights to parts of Italy at no charge Alitalia said on Sunday it was suspending national and international flights to and from Milanâ€™s Malpensa airport from March 9 United Airlines said it would reduce U.S. and Canadian flights by 10% and international flights by 20% in April, with similar cuts planned in May. It added South Korea to its travel waiver list but is not cancelling flights JetBluesaid it would cut capacity by about 5% in the near term Norwegian Air Shuttle, which has canceled 22 long-haul flights between Europe and the United States from March 28 to May 5, said on March 6 it was cancelling flights from Oslo to Milan Others, from South Korea and Italy, may be asked to stay home for 14 days after arriving back in the US 'depending on their travel history'. China is finally seeing a slowdown in the number of new daily cases. But experts have pointed to the drastic measures the country has had to take to get to that point. In a blog post on Thread Reader,Greek sociologistNicholas A. Christakis laid out how far China had gone to stop the spread, and what other countries would need to do to stop it for themselves. 'The Chinese government has essentially used a social nuclear weapon in its efforts. Letâ€™s talk about this, to understand what US is facing,' he wrote. China implemented movement restrictions which limited how people could leave their homes and how frequently they could leave their homes on communities which, collectively, account for 930milion people, he wrote. The restrictions included banning people from going out to buy food and arranging grocery deliveries for them instead. Anyone who did go out had to have a permit to show why they were allowed to. Christakis also shared a photograph of an elevator in China which had been separated into quadrants.No more than four people were allowed in it at one time.

1,"Furious Trump demands ANOTHER interest rate cut and calls Federal Reserve 'pathetic' and 'too slow' in its response to coronavirus crisis, as White House starts emergency payroll tax cut talks",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095703/WH-propose-payroll-tax-cut-sick-pay-hourly-workers-Nancy-Pelosi-skeptical.html,"President Donald Trump slammed the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, complaining that the central bank was moving too slow and demanding another interest rate cut. His complaints came as the stock market recovered after the Dow's worst day in 12 years. The president blamed Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell for the market, which has been taking dives amid fears of the coronavirus outbreak. Powell has been a repeat target of Trump's fury when the economy is doing poorly. 'Our pathetic, slow moving Federal Reserve, headed by Jay Powell, who raised rates too fast and lowered too late, should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations. They now have as much as a two point advantage, with even bigger currency help. Also, stimulate!,' the president tweeted. 'The Federal Reserve must be a leader, not a very late follower, which it has been!,' he wrote. Last week the fed slashed interest rates in the biggest one-time cut made since the 2008 financial crisis. Given the tanking markets the past week, there is chatter on Wall Street the central bank couldslash borrowing costs to zero. Meanwhile, Trump's administration and House Democrats are pitching competing relief packages to combat the economic havoc caused by concerns about the virus. Trump touting his own play, citing the work of Ronald Reagan economist Art Laffer, whose famous 'LafferCurve,' suggests lowering taxrates might increase taxrevenue. 'Ronald Reaganâ€™s great economist, the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, has just said great things about a Payroll Tax Cut!,' the president tweeted. Trump awarded Laffer the Medal of Freedom in June of last year. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol Monday that the Democrats' plan, proposed by herself and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, could be proposed and voted on as soon as this week. This plan would include paid sick leave for those impacted by coronavirus, widespread and free coronavirus testing access, expanding programs like food stamps and reimbursing patients for costs not covered by insurance related to the fast-spreading respiratory virus. She added that Democratic leadership could condense the congressional recess 'if there's a necessity â€” if we think we're going to get some action in the Senate to do it.' Pelosi and Schumer's plan comes as President Trump is proposing his own economic bailout plan in response to coronavirus concerns. The president charged the Democrats are doing nothing. 'Nancy Pelosi just said, â€œI donâ€™t know if we can be ready this week.â€ In other words, itâ€™s off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. Thatâ€™s been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!,' he tweeted on Tuesday. And he touted his administration's work in responding to the Coronavirus. The White House has been criticized for its response, particularly on the lack of kits to test for the disease. 'Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!,' Trump wrote. But top Democrats are criticizing the administration's plan for focusing too much on the economy rather than helping those directly impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Markets suffered their biggest-ever one-day loss on Monday and saw a decline not experienced since the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow dropped nearly 8 per cent on Monday, which concerned Trump, who often touts economic wins and market gains under his administration. Markets saw a slight rebound as they opened Tuesday morning as the Dow raised about 700. The president told reporters gathered in the briefing room at the White House Monday evening that he would be talking with Senate Republicans Tuesday on implementing a payroll tax cut, helping hourly workers not be penalized for taking off work and crisis loans for small business. He also said he is looking at helping cruise, airline and hotel industries as they suffer blows with escalating fears of the virus spread across the country. Trump promised his relief plan 'will be major' as Pelosi says the Democratic proposal would depend on the Congressional Budget Office and how quickly costs could be assessed. 'We are going to take care of, and have been taking care of, the American people and the American economy,' Trump said from the briefing room podium Monday and left without taking questions. Trump has continuously downplayed the threats of coronavirus, claiming the situation is 'inflamed' by the media and Democrats â€“ even as the death toll in the U.S. hit 26 this week and there are more than 750 confirmed cases. The threat hit close to home as U.S. and global markets plummeted Monday and one of his own Air Force One passengers, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, self-quarantined after learning he came in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus. While the president said he would be meeting with House Republicans and Senate leadership on Tuesday, he did not say if he would be speaking with Democrats, who control the House and whose approval is required for a tax relief plan to become law. Pelosi's office said that there is currently no plan for Trump to meet with Democrats. Vice President Mike Pence who heads the coronavirus task force and was left to answer reporters' questions after the president left the room Monday night, said he had not yet been tested for the virus. He also said he has no idea if the president has been tested, even though he attended the Conservative Political Action Conference and has come in close contact with individuals who have had contact with a person who tested positive. At 73-years-old, the president is at a higher risk of contracting and falling ill to coronavirus. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement late Monday night the president hasn't been tested. 'The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms. President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,' she said. Doctors and immunologist experts have recommended that those above 60 take extra precautions to avoid contracting the virus. Trump said that the world had been 'blindsided' by coronavirus, and claimed shutting down travel from China had been decisive in ensuring the crisis was not worse. 'We're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they're not going to ever miss a paycheck,' he said of his upcoming talk with lawmakers. The president's Treasury secretary mentioned a menu of actions the president can undertake on his own. Trump vowed to work with companies of all sizes 'so that they don't get penalized for something that's not their fault. It's not their fault, it's not our country's fault. This was something that we were thrown into and we're going to handle it and we have been handling it very well,' Trump said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who on Monday met with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., told reporters: 'The president is committed that whatever support we need to provide to the U.S. economy, we will use all our tools.' He said he has been speaking to the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, daily. He mentioned steps for workers that 'need to be at home.' He called them hardworking despite the quarantines they may face. Mnuchin also mentioned 'alternatives' at the IRS at tax time.' 'We have large tax payments coming up,' he said, mentioning providing 'certain relief to companies and individuals.' Returning from a day of fundraising after a weekend in Florida, Trump avoided specifics in advance of his meetings. 'We'll explain what we're doing on an economic standpoint and from an economic standpoint but they will be very dramatic and we have a great economy,' he said. House Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, whose Senate colleague Ted Cruz is under quarantine, was cool to the idea of tax cuts to boost the economy. ''I usually love tax cuts but I think it's a little bit premature,' he said, CNN reported. Trump said he would discuss the response at a news conference Tuesday. Mike Pence - who was left on the dais to answer questions - said he had not been tested but had no idea if the president had been. Unveiling a bailout appeared to be a desperate attempt to arrest a precipitous market selloff which shocked analysts and was prompted by the collapse in the price of oil. At the closing bell, the Dow was down by2,025.32, 7.83 percent, which was worse than the figure that had forced trading to a halt earlier in the day.It signals the worst ever point drop for the index. It was the worst day of trading on Wall Street since the global financial crisis in 2008. Trading was stopped by the Street's 'kill-switch', which is known as a circuit breaker, not long after the opening bell after stocks dropped by seven percent. It resumed after a 15 minute break but struggled to recover throughout the day and ended up finishing worse off than the day's beginning. For trading to have been halted for a second time, stocks would have had to have dropped by 13 percent. The chaos was caused by a 'one-two punch' of escalating panic surrounding coronavirus, and a precarious oil price war launched by Saudi Arabia against Russia and, in turn, the rest of the world. Last week, Russia refused to agree to the terms of a deal that would slash the world's oil production rates. In retaliation, Saudi Arabia vowed to boost production and slash prices, a move which threatens to saturate the world's market with cheap oil as demand for it plummets thanks to the virus. Despite the financial chaos, President Trump tweeted about that it was 'fake news' and that Democrats were to blame for mass hysteria. 'The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant,' he tweeted. 'Great job being done by the Vice Presidentand the CoronaVirus Task Force. 'Thank you!' 'The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world! 'So much FAKE NEWS!,' he said in others. He also said more Americans die every year from the common flu than of coronavirus. Even amid the market turmoil and focus on the health of the U.S. economy, Trump's own health was a concern amid concern about his potential exposure to a GOP lawmakers who had contact with a man who tested positive for the coronavirus. Trump refused to answer questions on Monday on whether he's been tested for the coronavirus after traveling withCongressman Matt Gaetz, who announced he came into contact with individual at C-PAC who had the coronavirus and is voluntarily self-quarantining. The president left a White House briefing on the disease after making a brief statement on the economic measures his administration was taking to combat the disease. He left the room and didn't answer as multiple journalists asked him if he had been tested for the virus.  Pence, who stayed to continue the briefing, said he has never been testified for the virus. Pence and President Trump both attended the CPAC conference at the end of the month, where an attendee tested positive for the disease. He said he would get reporters an answer on whether the president has been tested. 'We'll get you a very direct answer on that,' he said. 'I've had no recommendation that I be tested.' Gaetz traveled on Air Force One with President Trump on Monday when the president returned from Florida. He was spotted getting off the back of the plane, where he was met by an Air Force official and escorted to a waiting car. He was seen getting on the plane in Orlando, where he walked up the front stairs of Air Force One after the president. 'While the Congressman is not experiencing symptoms, he received testing today and expects results soon. Under doctor's usual precautionary recommendations, he'll remain self-quarantined until the 14-day period expires this week.' Gaetz learned after Air Force One left Orlando that he had been in touch with an infected person at CPAC, two sources told The New York Times. He then essentially quarantined himself, sitting in a section of the plane alone, the paper reported. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  The congressman told The Washington Post he was put into a 'closed up room' on Air Force One after he found out he might have been exposed to coronavirus. After landing, Trump 'coaxed' him up front before leaving. 'He was not hyper cautious about being in the same space that I was in,' Gaetz told the newspaper. 'I refused to go into his office, I stood outside the door. I told him he could talk from that distance,' he said. The Florida Republican wore a gas mask on the House floor last week to mock the outrage surrounding the epidemic. The stunt drew enormous attention, which his office acknowledged in Monday's statement. 'Congressman Gaetz had expected COVID-19 to impact Congress, given the elevated frequency of travel and human contact, and demonstrated his concern last week on the House Floor,' Gaetz office said. His Washington D.C. office on Capitol Hill will also be closed but his Florida office will remain open. Gaetz was spotted at Mar-a-Lago Saturday night where there was a dinner forBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and a birthday party forKimberly Guilfoyle. Also spotted at Mar-a-Lago that night were President Trump, Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.; Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump;Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Tiffany Trump was also spotted in photos posted to social media. Also seen was Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney; Vice President Mike Pence; Republican Senator Lindsey Graham; and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Gaetz was spotted on Wednesday wearing the mask ahead of the vote on an emergency spending bill to fight the virus. Just two days later and health officials announced the death of a manin Santa Rosa County, which falls underGaetz's northwestern Florida district. A second elderly person in Lee County has also died."
2,Dow rebounds 830 points after Trump promised emergency payroll tax cut in response to Wall Street's biggest one-day point drop ever amid coronavirus fears and oil price war,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095775/Stocks-point-higher-open-Trump-promised-emergency-payroll-tax-cut.html,"Wall Street's bounce ran out of steam on Tuesday and the Dow Jones slipped into negative territory after the indexes opened more than 3 percent higher on hopes of coordinated policy response to the coronavirus crisis. At 11.27am, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 59.58 points, or 0.25 percent, at 23,791.44, the S&P 500 was up 2.42 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,748.98. The Nasdaq Composite was up 30.71 points, or 0.39 percent, at 7,981.39. The Dow tumbled as much as 2,000 points on Monday, the index's largest ever single-day point drop. In addition to the outbreak, Wall Street was weighed down by a crash in oil prices following a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Sentiment was bolstered overnight after President Donald Trump promised 'major' steps to combat the virus outbreak and said he would discuss a payroll tax cut with congressional Republicans. Oil also recouped some losses from its biggest one-day decline since the Gulf War in 1991, supported by expectations for a settlement to the price war and potential U.S. output cuts. Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp climbed more than 7 percent in premarket trading, while Occidental Petroleum Corp, Apache Corp and Marathon Oil Corp jumped between 20 percent and 29 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 601.98 points, or 2.52 percent, at the open to 24,453.00 and the S&P 500 opened higher by 66.92 points, or 2.44 percent, at 2,813.48. The Nasdaq Composite gained 269.09 points, or 3.38 percent, to 8,219.76 at the opening bell. European indexes, many of which suffered their biggest one-day drop since the 2008 global crisis on Monday and fell into a bear market, were up by more than 3 percent. China's main stock index closed 1.8 percent higher and Tokyo rose 0.9 percent. Investors welcomed Tuesday's reprieve but weren't pretending this is the end to the marketÂ´s plunges, which took the S&P 500 on Monday to its worst day since the 2008 financial crisis. Stocks have had jumps even bigger than this in the past couple weeks, only for the bottom to give out again. Monday's global selloff reflected alarm over economic damage from the coronavirus that emerged in China in December. Anti-disease controls that shut down Chinese factories are spreading as the United States and European countries close schools, cancel public events and impose travel controls. Anxiety mounted after Italy, the hardest-hit place in Europe, said lockdown conditions that had previously been imposed in the northern regions would be extended nationwide. Ireland canceled St. Patrick's Day parades and Israel ordered visitors quarantined ahead of Passover and Easter, one of the busiest travel periods of the year. The mounting losses and a flight by investors into the safe haven of bonds have fueled warnings the global economy, which already was showing signs of cooling, might be headed into a recession. The drop in U.S. stock prices was so sharp that it triggered Wall Street's first trading halt in more than two decades. But Trump's comment that he will seek relief for workers as ripple effects of the outbreak spread gave some investors an excuse to resume buying. 'This is not like the financial crisis where we don't know the end is in sight,' said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. 'This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months.' An employee at Point72, the hedge fund of billionaire Steve Cohen, has tested positive for coronavirus. The employee at the hedge fund's new offices in Manhattan's Hudson Yards hasn't been in to work since early last week, the company told employees in an internal email reported by the Wall Street Journal. Point72 said in the email that the employee is'currently self-quarantined at home, safe, and receiving ongoing care' and that the company is working with health officials. Point72 also said it would be 'conducting a deep cleaning' of its 55 Hudson Yards location. In addition, the firm said it was requiring employees who worked over the past two weeks on the 14th floor, where the affected employee worked, to work from home for the next 14 days. 'The health and safety of our employees is a top priority, and we are taking the COVID-19 situation seriously,' Point72 spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin-Cohen said in a statement to DailyMail.com. 'In addition to working closely with state and local health departments, we are taking precautions and preventative measures to protect our employees and maintain a healthy work environment,' she contined. 'We have extensive business continuity plans in place to ensure the firm can continue to operate.' It is one of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 at a major financial firm in Manhattan. Other major financial players in Manhattan have already begun putting extensive plans in place to prepare for the outbreak, such as testing out remote working systems. At Morgan Stanley, employees are being split into teams that will rotate working from home a week at a time, as a firewall to prevent a company-wide outbreak, a source tells DailyMail.com. The New York Stock Exchange has said that it is prepared to continue operations with no floor traders if necessary due to the outbreak, with all trades being executed electronically."
3,"Stay home, stock up on meds and food, DON'T touch elevator buttons or door handles: CDC orders elderly and sick to 'take action' now to protect themselves against coronavirusÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093367/Virus-elderly-Avoid-crowds-cruises-long-plane-trips.html,"The Centers for Disease Control has ordered the elderly and sick to stock up on medications and avoid large crowds, cruise ships and airplanes in order to protect themselves against coronavirus. The elderly and those with underlying health conditions should also avoid touching door handles, hand rails and elevator buttons in public places, according to the advice on the CDC's website. Other advice includes stockingup on enough medication and food to 'stay at home for a period of time'. 'If a COVID-19 outbreak happens in your community, it could last for a long time,' the advice warning says. In the US, there are now more than 750 cases of coronavirus and 26 deaths.  The CDC issued the new advice for vulnerable people on Monday, stemming from an early study of 70,000 Chinese coronavirus patients. The advice is directed towards 'older people' and those with serious underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and lung disease. While the CDC does not specify what qualifies as an 'older person', it says the virus can be serious in those above 60, and most serious in those aged 80 or older. In order to protect themselves against the disease, vulnerable people should wash their hands thoroughly, avoid touching their face, and regularly clean 'high-touch' surfaces in their own home. Tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks and cell phones should all be cleaned regularly, the CDC says. If coronavirus starts spreading through a local community, vulnerable people should stay at home as much as possible - particularly avoiding large crowds and poorly ventilated spaces. 'Consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social, or commercial networks,' the advice says. 'Stay in touch with others by phone or email. You may need to ask for help from friends, family, neighbors, and community health workers if you become sick. 'Determine who can provide you with care if your caregiver gets sick.' Symptoms of coronavirus include fever, a cough and shortness of breath.The CDC warns that if you are a vulnerable person, you should contact your doctor if you get any of these symptoms. The vulnerable should also seek immediate care if they develop 'emergency symptoms', including difficulty breathing, persistent pain in the chest, confusion or blueish lips or face. 'Our goal is to protect you,' Dr Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. 'This will require you and your family to take action.' She acknowledged many people won't welcome the tips, but said, 'these are the kind of recommendations that I've made for my parents,' who are in their 80s. It comes as families across the US continue to clear out the shelves of supermarkets as the coronavirus spreads to more states, forcing some stores to ration more strictly. Costco outlets have begun to tighten rations that they had put on products in a bid to spread supply. Several stores reduced the number of packets of flour, sugar and rice each customer is allowed to buy from five to two per customer.Kroger has placed limits on certain items such as cold and flu-related products to five each per order. Footage from a Costco in Burbank, California showed customers being forced to line up outside due to the large crowds trying to get inside. The line of people with shopping carts was so long it snaked through the parking lot. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most common symptoms are: Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  As the CDC warned the vulnerable to avoid cruise ships,thousands of passengers aboard the Grand Princess waited anxiously on Tuesday for their chance to leave the vessel, even if it meant being shipped to military bases for weeks of quarantine. After days of being forced to idle off the Northern California coast, the Grand Princess docked Monday at the Port of Oakland with some 3,500 passengers and crew on board. About two dozen people who need acute medical care were taken off the ship, although it wasn't clear how many had tested positive for the new virus, according to Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. Many of the nearly 240 Canadians on board left the ship after the critically ill and stood outside two tents displaying Canadian flags. Canada and the UK were among the countries sending chartered flights to retrieve their citizens. But some 2,000 passengers, including hundreds of Californians, were still aboard by the time disembarkation ended Monday night. It was to resume on Tuesday morning, the captain told passengers. The Grand Princess had been held off the coast since Wednesday because of evidence that it was the breeding ground for more than 20 infections tied to a previous voyage. US passengers will be flown or bused from the port - chosen for its proximity to an airport and a military base - to bases in California, Texas and Georgia for testing and a 14-day quarantine. Some arrived on Monday night at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California. The ship carried people from 54 countries and foreigners were to be whisked home. About 1,100 crew members, 19 of whom have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere after passengers are unloaded, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said. The California governor and Oakland mayor sought to reassure people that none of the cruise ship passengers would be exposed to the public before completing the quarantine. Officials were trying to decide where the ship and its crew would go next. Cruise ships have come under scrutiny by those who view them as potential germ factories because they pack thousands of people in close quarters. Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public health failure. A third vessel, the Caribbean Princess, was supposed to dock in Grand Cayman on Monday but the cruise line said it will keep its thousands of passengers and crews from disembarking until crew members are tested for COVID-19. Around the world, nations have limited the movements of millions of people in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Italy was to impose travel restrictions and other strict public health measures nationwide starting Tuesday. In Northern California, Santa Clara County announced a ban of all large gatherings of at least 1,000 people for the rest of the month in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The virus has shaken global markets, with stocks taking their worst one-day beating on Wall Street since 2008 and oil prices suffering their most brutal losses since the start of the 1991 Gulf War. Even with Asian markets posting modest gains Tuesday, fear was rampant that economies stood at the brink of recession. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done after an outbreak in the Seattle area. As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, health experts advise plane travelers to sit in a window seat, disinfect their table trays and window blinds, and warn that wearing a mask won't prevent infection. Officials say the best way to avoid catching the virus, which is spread through viral particles within mucus or saliva, is to keep your hands clean, disinfect your space, and avoid touching your face. It is also advised that plane travelers choose a window seat to have less contact with potentially sick people. 'Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,' Vicki Stover Hertzberg, professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, said. Hertzberg helped conduct a study that followed passengers and crew members on 10 three to five-hour flights during the flu season and found that passengers who sit in the window seats had less contact with ill people. Wearing a mask on the plane may not prove helpful as the air in the aircraft is considered sterile because there are so few microorganisms at such a high altitude and the plane draws fresh air from the outside. About 50 percent of the air in cabins is recirculated but it goes through sophisticated air filters similar to those used in surgical environments, before it's its pushed back into the plane. A problem with paper masks is that they don't have a respirator to filter out infectious air articles. That means passengers are more likely to catch the virus through direct contact from someone with the virus or surfaces rather than through the air. But one study found that the other coronaviruses - such as SARS and MERS - remains on metal, glass, and plastic surfaces for up to nine days. Top tips include: - Good hand hygiene: Frequently wash hands for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitzer - Disinfect your space: Bring your own wipes and wipe down window blinds, seat belts, arm rests, touch screens and tray tables - Choose a window seat: Sit near the window and avoid moving around the cabin to limit exposure to potentially sick people - Use touch screen with a tissue: Avoid contact with surfaces that may hold the virus - Avoid touching your face: 2019-nCov is spread through viral particles in mucus or saliva. Avoid touching your face and transferring germs picked up from surfaces Ying Yong, the party secretary of Hubei province where Wuhan is located, told local officials that preparations should be made for resuming business production and the safe and orderly movement of individuals, according to a notice published on Hubei's government website. Already, there are signs the lockdown is loosening. Jingzhou, a city in Hubei, has ordered roads and village entrances in low-risk areas to be reopened to restore agricultural production. The edge toward normalcy in China and improving reports from South Korea - where new infections continued to dip - contrasted with a widening problem elsewhere in the world. Italy's far-reaching restrictions were to last through April 3 and violators risked up to three months in jail or fines of 206 euros ($225). Schools and universities were remaining closed and pubs, eateries and cafes were to shutter at dusk. 'Our habits must be changed, changed now,' Conte said. In the U.S., President Donald Trump was planning to announce proposals Tuesday aimed at curbing the economic fallout from the outbreak. He said the measures would include payroll tax relief. Trump dove into handshakes with supporters Monday and flew back from a Florida fundraiser with a lawmaker who later went into a voluntary quarantine because he came into contact with someone who had tested positive for the virus. Trump's incoming chief of staff, too, went into quarantine, also stemming from concerns from a conservative political gathering an infected person attended. Worldwide, more than 114,000 cases of the virus have been reported in about 100 countries. The leader of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Monday, 'the threat of a pandemic has become very real.' The most recent additions are Panama, adding to a few dozen cases in Latin America, and Mongolia, which borders China. Authorities there said Tuesday the country's first virus patient was a French energy worker who met with colleagues and traveled while he was infected. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready."
4,"NYC Mayor de Blasio says there will be NO public school closures - despite some private schools shutting - and no Italy-style lockdown, as five new coronavirus cases are confirmed in cityÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095941/New-York-City-confirms-five-new-coronavirus-cases-bringing-total-25.html,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says there will be no widespread school closures for now and insists there won't be an Italy-style lockdown as he confirmed five new coronavirus cases in the city. There are now 25 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York City and more than 160 across the state, including two school bus drivers who each have contact with about 80 children. The Mayor said on Tuesday that New York City will not close down to contain the coronavirus outbreak following the Italian government's decision to place its country on lockdown. 'We cannot shut down because of undue fear,' de Blasio told MSNBC's Morning Joe. 'I would advise against these mass closures when we're keeping this situation relatively contained...ask me in a week, ask me in a month - it might change.' He is also currently not considering widespread closures to public schools. Health officials have previously said school closures in the city would be a last resort. 'Our schools are running. And we've said, even if, God forbid, we found a case in a school, we're not shutting down all our schools. We're not even shutting that school down long term,' de Blasio said. 'We'll go in, clean that school, isolate individuals who had that really direct contact, and then get up and running. We'll have a day where a school is shut to get reset, then get back up and running. Because people's livelihoods are at stake. Parents need a place for their kids. 'We can stay safe but still keep our lives going, our economy going. People have to pay the rent, people need money for food etc.' De Blasio said individual schools might close for a brief period of students or teachers became infected. The outbreak has resulted in a number of mostly private schools canceling or suspending in person classes.In New York City, Columbia University, Yeshiva University, New York University andJuilliard announced that classes would be canceled or offered online. Elsewhere in the state, public and private schools in Scarsdale in Westchester County will be closed until at least March 18 after a staffer tested positive. Two bus drivers in Long Island's Nassau County are among the new cases who have tested positive for coronavirus. Those two drivers are responsible for roughly 80 students on various daily routes. The positive tests have resulted in several Long Island school closures includingin Oyster Bay, Locust Valley, Glen Cove and Westbury. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday the state was implementing a new policy that if student or teacher tested positive, the school would be shut down for at least 24 hours to be assessed and disinfected. Meanwhile, de Blasio also said he couldn'tget a coherent answer from the FDA over its 'unfathomable' decision not to approve automated testing. Health officials in the city would be able to test thousands of people a day for coronavirus if the FDA approved automated testing, de Blasio said on Tuesday. Currently, officials in New York City can only carry out 100 or so coronavirus tests per day. 'As recently as eight days ago New York City did not have the ability to do their own tests. We finally have that ability but what we still don't have is approval from the FDA to do automated tests,' de Blasio said. 'If we had the approval from the FDA for automated tests, it would be thousands of tests we could in a single day with results the same day. 'It's unfathomable that after this long these tests have not been approved.' It came as de Blasio confirmed five new coronavirus cases in the city, bringing the total to 25.The number of confirmed cases in New York state has reached more than 140. The main cluster of cases in the state remains in Westchester where a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week and subsequently infected his family and others. There were 98 confirmed cases in Westchester as of Monday. De Blasio said on Monday that New York City had produced 205 negative tests so far and that more than 2,000 people were in voluntary quarantine.An additional 24 people were in mandatory quarantine, he said. The Mayor on Monday urged sick or vulnerable New Yorkers to only use the subway if necessary to avoid spreading coronavirus. A seven-year-old girl in the Bronx and a the head of New York and New Jersey's Port Authority Rick Cotton are among the recently confirmed cases. Elsewhere in the tri-state area, New Jersey now has 11 cases and Connecticut has reported two cases. The US death toll from the disease is currently at 26 with the majority being from Washington state following an outbreak at a nursing home just outside Seattle. To cope with the outbreak, Gov Cuomo announced the state would be making its own hand sanitizer after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend. Speaking about the new sanitizer, Gov Cuomo said it was made up of75 percent alcohol and will be provided to facilities including schools, the MTA, government run buildings and prisons. Cuomo said that state currently has the capacity to make 100,000 gallons of the sanitizer per week, adding that it is cheaper for officials to make it instead of buying it on the market. It is being manufactured byCorcraft, which is the company that relies on prisoners in New York to make products, and is beingmade by inmates at the Great Meadow correctional facility. The state-made sanitizer costs about $6 per gallon to produce, according to Cuomo. He said the production stemmed from reports of price gouging on sanitizer."
5,Home workers reveal tips for office employees who find themselves remote working because of coronavirus - including making a 'cat proof' barrier across your keyboard,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8095501/British-workers-share-tips-working-home.html,"Workers from across the globe, who are working from home as an increasing number of employers attempt to stop coronavirus from spreading, have shared their tips to navigating the practice. Taking to Twitter, the thread was kicked off byscientist Emily Lakdawalla, from California, who wrote: 'Friends, there are going to be a lot of people newly working from home starting this week, and it will be a difficult transition for some.' Asking for advice, she continued:'*IF AND ONLY IF you are experienced at working from home*, please reply with tips for working effectively & avoiding distractions!'. And Emily was quickly inundated with replies from staff in similar situations, racking up almost 5,000 likes and comments. British chef Jack Monroe wrote: 'I've been working from home for seven years and I am injecting this thread into my bloodstream right now because it is INCREDIBLY USEFUL (I'll be back with my own sub-par tips in the morning....later in the morning...!!)'. Elsewhere one joked: 'Refrain from having children', while another advised: 'Make a cat-proof barrier around your keyboard'. Another advised on how to transition, tweeting: 'Leave the house in the morning to go to work, walk round the block and then come back into your house and settle down to work. Helps make the mental transition.' And one wrote: 'Set and stick to work hours. You can split hours morning/night with afternoon 'off' or timeshift, but still have set hours or you'll constantly get derailed. It's easy to get distracted by flexibility to take a social call, duck out for an errand, or procrastinate with chores.' Advising about how to differentiate, another said: 'If you can, work in a different room to your living room/where you will spend the evening (even if it's your bedroom) so you're at least moving rooms when you finish for the day.' Speaking from experience, one worker advised followers to have a separate working area. She wrote: 'I work from home most of the time anyway. My advice:â€¢stay away from the TVâ€¢if your bed triggers nap mode, work in the living room. If not possible, fill room with LIGHT (natural, or desk lamp)â€¢keep your phone on another desk and put on silent for the hours you plan to work'. And speaking to other parents, one revealed it was best to plan post school hours out of the home. He said: 'Work your usual office hours. After 3pm when the kids come home is most difficult so plan for it. Take walks during conference calls. Go out for coffee and lunch. No TV in the background. Treat it like a normal day at the office.' Talking about their battle with their cat, another wrote: 'Keep a second keyboard nearby to use as a decoy for your cats.' And others cited the benefits of working from home, writing: 'One of the best things about working from home is being able to have a powernap after lunch. Makes you so much more productive in the afternoon.' Warning against letting work take over your life, one Twitter user said: 'Set work hours and have a distinct work space. When you're done working for the day, leave the space, and leave your computer there. Do not check email on your phone after hours, or if you do, do not respond until the morning unless it's urgent.'"
6,How one man spread coronavirus to NINE other people on his bus in China: Scientists find the deadly virus can travel more than double the 'safe' distance and linger in the air for over 30 minutes,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094933/How-one-man-spread-coronavirus-NINE-people-bus.html,"A man infected with coronavirus spread the virus to nine other people on his bus, raising fears the killer infection can jump between people far easier than initially thought in confined places. A study found two victims sitting 4.5 metres (14.7ft) away from the man were later diagnosed, which is four times what is considered a 'safe distance' to stand near an COVID-19 patient. Countries including Italy and the UK have implemented one to two metre distancing between people to limit outbreaks. The virus has been thought to spread via cough or sneeze droplets, but the study found germs can linger in the air for long periods of time. One traveller caught the coronavirus half an hour after the initial COVID-19 carrier got off, according to the scientists. None of the people who wore a face mask on the bus ride were diagnosed with COVID-19, indicating that those taking extra precaution on public transport are protected. In total, the man led to 13 others being infected. At the time, a crisis had not been declared in the country, where the virus originated. Now more than 114,400 cases and 4,000 deaths have been confirmed worldwide. The study also found the coronavirus can last for days on a surface, particularly in warmer temperatures, on plastic, fabric and metal. The findings shed light on the importance of extreme measures to prevent clusters of cases. It also throws into question who 'close contact' of confirmed cases are, considering complete strangers were infected by the man. The study follows an unprecedented lockdown of Italy, trapping millions inside the nation. Universities and schools have been shut. Italy has become the country hardest hit by COVID-19 outside of China with more than 9,000 cases and almost 500 deaths. All forms of public gatherings have been prohibited, and people have been told to stay indoors and not travel unless it is essential, for example for medical reasons. The UK Government and the NHS have urged the public to wash their hands to stop the coronavirus, with a hard-hitting advertising campaign showing how the virus can survive on some surfaces for hours, remaining contagious. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his ministers and officials are hammering home the message that hand-washing is the best thing people can do to protect themselves. People should wash their hands for 20 seconds at a time with hot water and soap, making sure they clean every side of their hands and fingers. Chief medical officer for the Government, Professor Chris Whitty, said people can catch the illness by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their face. And the coronavirus may stay contagious on hard metal or plastic surfaces like door handles or rails on buses or trains for as long as three days, he added. Some scientists have even suggested the virus may be more likely to spread on the hands than it is through the air. Speaking at a meeting with ministers in Parliament this morning, Professor Whitty said the virus would 'largely gone by 48 hours and almost completely gone by 72 hours on a hard surface'. He clarified that the virus spreads when somebody who already has it coughs or sneezes onto their hand, then touches something or someone. Anyone who touches something the patient has contaminated is at risk of catching the virus if they then touch their face, he said. The virus can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, but not through the skin, Professor Whitty explained. Italians have been told to stand at least one metre (3.2ft) away from each other since the beginning of the month. The move follows China, where the crisis began in December, and the UK â€“ where Public Health England recommends if staff or a pupil in school feels unwell, they should be isolated and kept two metres (6.5ft) away from anyone else. Other 'social distancing' rules include the banning of kissing in France and Switzerland, and advice to 'elbow bump' instead of shake hands across the globe. The researchers at the Hunan Provincial Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention studied 'patient A', a man who had been infected around January 22 during the peak Lunar New Year travel season, the South China Morning Post reported. Hu Shixiong, the lead author of the study,said the security camera footage showed patient A did not interact with anyone on the long-distance bus. Patient A had been feeling sick on the day he travelled, but the country was not yet in the depths of its epidemic, when whole cities were put into lockdown and travel bans stopped residents from leaving. At this point, scientists also did not have evidence that human to human transmission was occurring. Patient A took a four-hour bus ride, and CCTV allowed researchers to analyse the path of his germs from where he sat near the back. By the time the bus stopped at the next city, the virus had already jumped from the carrier to seven other passengers, including those sitting close to him and also two victims six rows away. All passengers were diagnosed when they presented with the characteristic symptoms - a cough, a fever and shortness of breath. One other bus passenger was diagnosed but did not have symptoms. Another group of passengers got on the bus about 30 minutes after patient A and his fellow travellers disembarked. One passenger sitting near the front on the other side of the aisle also became infected. They could have breathed in fluid droplets breathed out by patient A or other now infected passengers from the previous group. Patient A took another bus that day, for around one hour. In that time, the virus jumped to two other passengers, one of whom was also sitting 4.5 metres away. By the time the study was finished in mid February, patient A had infected at least 13 people in total. Until now, it has generally been believed that the airborne transmission of COVID-19 germs is limited because the tiny droplets produced by patients will quickly sink to the ground. The researchers explained that the confined space of the bus, along with air conditioning, made for the perfect environment for the coronavirus to spread. The team also found the length of time coronavirus germs last on the surface depends on factors such as temperature and the type of surface. At around 37Â°C, it can survive for two to three days on glass, fabric, metal, plastic or paper. Scientists are still unclear on exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person. But similar viruses are spread in cough and sneeze droplets. Coronaviruses can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days depending on the type of surface, temperature and other conditions, according to The World Health Organization. The researchers suggested improved sanitation on public transport, with cleaning twice a day between passengers. Dr Shixiong and colleagues wrote:'It can be confirmed that in a closed environment with air-conditioning, the transmission distance of the new coronavirus will exceed the commonly recognised safe distance. 'The possible reason is that in a completely enclosed space, the airflow is mainly driven by the hot air generated by the air conditioning. The rise of the hot air can transport the virus-laden droplets to a greater distance. 'When riding on more closed public transportation such as subways, cars, planes, etc, you should wear a mask all the time, and at the same time, minimise the contact between your hands and public areas, and avoid touching your face before cleaning.' When a person is confirmed to have COVID-19, health authorities rush to trace close contacts. Public Health England defines a close contact as anyone who spends more than 15 minutes within two metres of an infected person, rather than simply passing them in the street or be around them in a shop. The study paints a more complex picture about how easily the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can reach others. However, adoctor in Beijing, China, who diagnoses and treats COVID-19 patients, said there were clearly people on the studied bus who were not infected despite sitting next to patient A. 'Our knowledge about this virus's transmission is still limited,' he said to the SCMP. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 4,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 110,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 â€“ possibly 9,700 â€“ were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 â€“ doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests â€“ caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. There is now evidence that it can spread third hand â€“ to someone from a person who caught it from another person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak is an epidemic, which is when a disease takes hold of one community such as a country or region. Although it has spread to dozens of countries, the outbreak is not yet classed as a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. The head of WHO's global infectious hazard preparedness, Dr Sylvie Briand, said: 'Currently we are not in a pandemic. We are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci, and we try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci,' the Guardian reported. She said that most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world."
7,Tourist spots stand empty while panic-buying Italians queue down the streets to get food and police go on patrol telling people to stay inside as country's coronavirus lockdown begins,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094777/Italian-doctors-forced-choose-lives-dies.html,"Italian streets and piazzas were empty today while shoppers crammed into supermarkets to stock up for a lengthy quarantine as the country began an unprecedented nationwide lockdown. Tourist favourites including Milan's shopping galleries, Rome's Spanish Steps and Vatican's St Peter's Square were all but deserted today after the drastic coronavirus measures were extended to the entire country last night. Panic-buyers were packing into supermarkets this morning with queues stretching outside because of a rule that demands a 3ft gap between shoppers - meaning only a limited number can go inside at once. In Naples, police were roaming the streets with a loudhailer last night to warn people to 'stay indoors, avoid unnecessary outings and avoid crowded places' because of the 'coronavirus emergency'. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte declared last night that 'everyone must give up something to protect the health of citizens' with 9,000 virus cases confirmed in Italy and 463 people dead. Anyone with a fever has been ordered to stay indoors with travel banned except in emergencies and public gatherings including weddings, funerals and sports fixtures shut down. Almost 50 people are already facing fines for holding a rogue funeral in Sicily today. The virus is spreading so quickly that doctors are now having to make life-or-death decisions about who gets access to intensive care. Medics have described 'overwhelmed' hospitals in northern Italy where non-virus cases are sidelined, elderly patients are not properly assessed and overworked doctors are left 'in tears'. British Airways and Jet2 have today cancelled all their hundreds of flights to and from Italy until April at the earliest and easyJet has grounded most services â€“ but people are still flowing into Britain from without checks. BA has axed its 60 flights a day to cities including Milan, Venice and Rome while Jet2 has gone even further and cancelled its services for almost two months until April 26. EasyJet has stopped the majority of its flights to northern Italy but planes will still fly from southern cities such as Rome and Naples despite the blanket travel ban imposed by the Italian government. The UK government has now advised Britons against all but essential travel to the country, but Italian airports remain open. Public Health England says airline cabin crews have been trained to spot virus symptoms. Many British travellers returning home from Italy told MailOnline today they had no idea the Government was now demanding they go into self-isolation for 14 days as soon as they land in the UK. They must also find their way home by public transport if they are not driving themselves home. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte said last night's decree could be 'summarised as follows: I stay at home'. Here are the rules under the new decree. THE SICK MUST STAY AT HOME People who have tested positive for coronavirus must not leave their homes for any reason. Anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms is urged to stay at home and limit social contact, including with their doctor. NO TRAVEL ACROSS ITALY Travel is only allowed for 'urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons'. Grocery shopping is considered a 'necessity' and still allowed. To avoid work-related travel, public and private companies have been urged to put their staff on leave. However, it was not immediately clear how the new measures would be enforced. Trains and numerous flights continued to operate into and out of Milan on Monday despite the earlier restrictions in Lombardy. Public transport will remain operational, but Conte says he wants as many people as possible to stay at home. People who do want to travel will need to fill in a document explaining their reasons for doing so and carry it with them. If they are found to have lied they face fines or jail terms. But they will generally work on an honour system. People will also be allowed to travel to return home. NO PUBLIC GATHERINGS 'All forms of gatherings in public places or sites open to the public' are banned, the decree says. Cinemas, museums, theatres, pubs, dance schools, betting shops and discos are all closed. Weddings and funerals are banned. Schools and universities will remain shut until April 3. Bars and restaurants were only allowed to open between 8am and 6pm, the decree said, and only if a distance of at least 3ft could be kept between customers. Sporting events of all levels and disciplines were cancelled - stopping play in the Serie A football league.Fixtures in international competitions can go ahead but will be played behind closed doors. Gyms, sports centres, swimming pools, spas and leisure centres must close. SHOPS MUST KEEP 3FT DISTANCE Shops can remain open but only if they can guarantee the 3ft safety distance for customers. Big and mid-sized shopping centres have to close at the weekend. Food stores are allowed to remain open at all hours. NO LEAVE FOR HEALTH WORKERS Leave for health workers is cancelled. People accompanying their friends or relatives to emergency units are not allowed to stay with them in the waiting rooms without express permission. ALL OF ITALY IS COVERED The entire country, including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, is covered by the decree - covering a total population of some 60million people. Uber driver Francesco Stabile told MailOnline at Stansted today that he had 'no idea' about the 14-day self-isolation advice after visiting his girlfriend in Italy. Mr Stabile 38, who has lived in Letchworth for the past 16 years, said he was keen to get back to work, adding: 'I am an Uber driver. I go to Italy every two weeks to visit my girlfriend. I have received information from the Foreign Office but I don't know anything about self-isolating. I am feeling well. I have nothing wrong with me.' Some flights from Italy bound for the US were also going ahead today. At least three flights from Rome had already departed for America as of 7am EST (11am UK time) - bound for Miami, Atlanta and New York's Newark Liberty airport. Another flight from Milan, at the center of Italy's outbreak, to Newark was also scheduled to go ahead having been delayed from the previous day. New York's JFK airport had cancelled two flights from Milan as of Tuesday morning, with a third Emirates flight due to arrive at 7pm still showing as 'scheduled' though it is far from clear whether it will go ahead. On Monday night, passengers arriving in the US still faced no screening. Just one flight landed in America last night: Emirates Flight 205 from Milan, which arrived at JFK at 7.53pm. The new restrictions shutting down Italy were announced while the passenger jet was in the air. But travellers were furious at the lack of checks in US airports, noting that no one was being screened for COVID-19 symptoms upon landing. 'My friend just landed at JFK from Italy and they didn't even check her or anyone on her plane but they checked the plane from China. Even though all of Italy just got shut down makes total sense!' a Twitter user named Kimberly sarcastically posted Monday night. Huge numbers of flights from Italy to the US have been cancelled, but more are scheduled for the forthcoming days. Marjorie Perrelli Day tweeted at JFK's Twitter account: 'I have friends coming from Italy today from Rome. What will they have to do since Italy is now totally shut down. People have been tweeting that JFK has zero screening. So can you explain this?' Austrian chancellorSebastian Kurz said today his country was putting in place 'anentry ban for people from Italy to Austria, unless they have a doctor's certificate'. Austrians in neighbouring Italy will be allowed to return as long as they agree to a two-week home quarantine, he added.Interior minister Karl Nehammer said trains and flights from Italy to Austria would be stopped. The measure follows growing calls for greater border controls within Europe, although the EU has maintained it has no plans to scrap the Schengen border-free zone. Spain today decided to cancel all direct flights from Italy for two weeks in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, whileMalta has stopped all travel links with Italy, its nearest neighbour and main source of food and other essentials. However, most governments are still allowing flights - effectively leaving it to airlines to decide. Saudi Arabia is one exception, after the government halted flights between the kingdom and eight countries including Italy. Lebanon has also halted flights from several countries including Italy, although Lebanese citizens and residents are exempted. Kenya's government has suspended flights from northern Italy. Budapest-based low-cost carrier Wizz Air said today it is cancelling all flights to and from Italy and Israel due to measures announced by those countries to prevent the spread of the virus. Pope Francis today urged Catholic priests to visit people suffering from coronavirus despite a ban on most travel across Italy. Francis prayed that clergymen would 'have the courage to go out and go to the sick people' as he celebrated Mass by himself at the Vatican this morning. The service in the chapel of Francis' residence was live-streamed by the Vatican today, with the 83-year-old pontiff avoiding public gatherings. 'Let us pray to the Lord also for our priests, that they may have the courage to go out and go to the sick people bringing the strength of God's word and the Eucharist and accompany the health workers and volunteers in this work that they are doing,' Francis said. Francis also prayed for Italy's thousands of sick patients and the doctors and nurses who are caring for them in his homily today. His service today, held in the chapel of the Santa Marta guest house where he lives, came just hours after Italy extended its quarantine measures to the whole country. The pope last week cancelled a series of events after suffering from a cold during an Ash Wednesday service. Fears were raised after Francis was pictured hugging and kissing members of the public after speaking with a hoarse voice and blowing his nose in church. However, the pontiff is thought to have tested negative for coronavirus last week. He resumed some private meetings yesterday, including with bishops from France and two departing ambassadors. It comes as Italy faces being overwhelmed by the scale of the outbreak with doctorsmaking comparisons to wartime triage medics deciding who lives, who dies and who gets access to the limited number of beds. Italian health officials had warned on Saturday that the northern Lombardy region was starting to run out of hospital beds for its intensive care patients. The government also began to recall retired doctors as part of an effort to quickly bolster the health service with 20,000 staff. Ethics rules call on doctors to consider a patient's age and their chance of survival when allocating hospital beds. The Italian society of anaesthesiology and intensive care has published 15 ethical recommendations to consider for doctors when deciding on admissions. The criteria include the patient's age and the likelihood of survival, and not just 'first come first served.' 'It's a reasoning that our colleagues make,' Dr. Guido Giustetto, head of the association of doctors in northern Piedmont, said yesterday. 'It becomes dramatic if, rather than doing it under normal situations, they do it because the beds are so scarce that someone might not have access to medical care.' Italy expanded its quarantine measures to all 60million people in the country last night after a lockdown in the hardest-hit north, including Milan and Venice, had failed to slow the outbreak. 'Our habits must be changed, changed now. We all have to give up something for the good of Italy,' prime minister Conte said. 'When I speak of Italy, I speak of our dear ones, of our grandparents and of our parents,' he said. 'We will succeed only if we all collaborate and we adapt right away to these more stringent norms.' Conte also raged at young people who had continued to gather socially as the virus spread, saying 'this night life ... we can't allow this any more.' Professor Della Giusta, from the Piedmont region in the north-west of the country, said many people did not take self-isolation measures very seriously when schools were first closed in northern regions a few weeks ago. 'When schools got shut in Lombardy a lot of people just took their kids and went off on holiday to their holiday homes in the mountains and at the seaside in the other regions,' he said. 'They thought they were making their kids safe by taking them away, but this kind of behaviour is really very damaging.' The EU on Tuesday praised Italy for taking 'bold' steps to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, adding that Brussels would do all in its power to help. 'We commend the Italian authorities for the very courageous measures they are taking,' European Commission executive vice president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters. 'We know that they will put a great strain on the Italian people, but it's better to take those bold measures now to protect as many people as possible from the virus,' he said. Almost 50 people in Sicily faced are already facing stiff fines for holding an illegal funeral despite the ban on public gatherings, media reports said today. The sombre procession was moving through the streets of Porto Empedocle on the island's southwestern coast when the carabinieri police were alerted by a passerby, the AGI news agency said. One Italian doctor, Daniele Macchini, has warned that people should 'not go en masse to stock up in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are higher. You can go there as you usually do.' But his warnings fell on deaf ears today as worried shoppers were pictured queuing outside supermarkets and pushing overflowing shopping trolleys to stock up for the quarantine. SomeItalians used the open border to Slovenia to do their usual shopping on Tuesday, despite the travel restrictions imposed from Rome. Italians from the area around the city of Trieste in north-east Italy often cross the border to Slovenia to fill their cars with cheaper fuel and do their shopping. Italian hospitals are so 'overwhelmed' bycoronavirusthat strokes are going untreated and elderly patients are not even being assessed, a doctor at the centre of the crisis has said - while another medic said people should be panicking more. Doctors in Italy have been forced into life-or-death decisions over who should receive intensive care, with virus cases piling up around the country. A medic in northern Italy told a friend in the UK that hospitals were running at '200 per cent capacity' with operating theatres hurriedly converted into intensive care units. Non-coronavirus cases are being sidelined with some medics being given a 'leaflet' and told to perform specialist tasks for which they are not qualified, while some patients over 65 are not even being assessed, the doctor said. In addition, medical staff themselves are becoming 'sick and emotionally overwhelmed' and left 'in tears' because they cannot stop people dying, they said. The medic's comments were published in a Twitter thread by UK-based friend Jason van Schoor, an anaesthetist and clinical fellow at University College London. The doctor also issued a warning for the UK, saying that the Italian chaos would repeat itself in Britain 'if you don't take it seriously'. His warning was echoed by a second doctor who suggested people should be more scared, saying that overzealous warnings to remain calm meant 'the danger of what is happening does not reach people'. Experts have suggested that the UK outbreak is around two weeks behind that in Italy, meaning Britain could be heading for a similar nightmare within a fortnight. The nationwide restrictions mean that all schools and universities will remain closed until April 3, with cafes, pubs and eateries ordered to close until dusk. Italians have been ordered not to move around the country except for work and emergencies, with public gatherings and Serie A football matches cancelled. The streets of Rome were much quieter than normal this morning, with cars moving freely under a clear blue sky in the normally traffic-clogged centre. Rome commuters could easily find seats in the usually jam-packed underground system during the morning rush hour today. In Milan, checkpoints were set up at the city's central railway station to screen travellers for the first time. People at the station were required to sign a police form, self-certifying why they were traveling. 'Until a few days ago, the thinking was the alarm would pass in some weeks, we just need to follow the rules. Now we need to explain to citizens that the situation is very, very serious, our hospitals are at the point of collapse,' the mayor of the Lombardy city of Bergamo, Giorgio Gori, told RAI state television. Meanwhile, payments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of Italy, the country's deputy economy minister said today in the latest effort to manage the economic impact of the crisis. 'Yes, that will be the case, for individuals and households,' Laura Castelli said in an interview with Radio Anch'io, when asked about the possibility. Italy's banking lobby ABI said yesterday that most lenders would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout. The government has also drawn up plans for an economic stimulus and has led calls for the EU to loosen budget rules to tackle the crisis. On Monday, the Milan stock exchange dropped over 11 per cent and Italy's borrowing costs shot up, reviving fears that an economy already struggling under the eurozone's second-heaviest debt pile could be plunged into crisis. Industry minister Stefano Patuanelli said today that the government would approve measures worth around 10 billion euros.Conte has already promised 'massive shock therapy' to help deal with the immediate impact. Italy registered 1,807 more confirmed cases as of Monday evening, for a national total of 9,172. The number of dead in Italy also increased by 97 to 463 - most of them elderly with previous ailments. It comes with China beginning to scale down its virus operation, closing the temporary hospitals which sprung up in Wuhan where the outbreak began in December last year. 'Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. But he welcomed Italy's tough measures, noting that just four countries - China, South Korea, Italy and Iran - accounted for 93 per cent of cases worldwide. 'It would be the first pandemic that could be controlled,' Tedros added. 'The bottom line is we are not at the mercy of the virus.' The Lombardy government has been scrambling to increase its intensive care capacity, converting operating and recovery rooms into isolated wards. It has cobbled together 150 more beds in the last two weeks and expects another 150 in the coming week. 'Unfortunately we're only at the beginning,' said Dr. Massimo Galli, head of infectious disease at Milan's Sacco hospital. Speaking to SkyTg24, Galli said the numbers of infections registered in Lombardy last week were similar to those in Wuhan, China in late January. Galli noted that Wuhan, the center of China's outbreak that infected more than 80,000 people nationwide, is a concentrated metropolis of 11 million and Lombardy is spread out. But the numbers 'tell you that the diffusion is a real possibility,' he warned. Payments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of Italy after the coronavirus outbreak, the country's deputy economy minister said today. 'Yes, that will be the case, for individuals and households,' Laura Castelli said in an interview with Radio Anch'io, when asked about the possibility. Italy's banking lobby ABI has said that lenders representing 90 per cent of total banking assets would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout. The news comes as Italy announced that it had doubled the amount it plans to spend on tackling its coronavirus outbreak to Â£6.5billion and is raising this year's deficit goal to 2.5 per cent of national output from the current 2.2 per cent target. Speaking to La Repubblica, prime minister Conte yesterday vowed a course of 'massive shock therapy' to aid the Italian economy after much of its industrial and business heartland was shut down. The Milan stock market, which was already down some 17 per cent since the outbreak in northern Italy, plunged at Monday's opening, with the blue chip FTMIB index down 11 per cent. Matching similar calls from France, Conte said strict European Union borrowing limits should be loosened to allow more room for manoeuvre, and that the flexibility envisaged by the EU's budget rules should be used 'in full'. 'Europe cannot think of confronting an extraordinary situation with ordinary measures,' he said. The European Commission told Italy on Saturday that its planned extra spending in response to the outbreak would not be counted in measuring its compliance with EU budget rules. 'The economic measures in the works will be vigorous, commensurate to current needs, but temporary,' the economy ministry said, adding that Italy remained committed to reducing its debt as soon as possible. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: 'The recent extension of Covid-19 controls in Italy represent one of the most rigorous country-wide control measures implemented in the last 50 years. 'Whilst we have seen in Wuhan that such intensive social distancing can bring the epidemic under control, it is far from clear how long this may need to be maintained in the Italian context. 'Unlike the situation in Wuhan where there was the possibility that the global epidemic could be prevented, Covid-19 is already spreading globally. So when the restrictions in Italy are eased there may still be a large number of cases in nearby countries that could lead to spread back into Italy. 'Would this degree of restriction be appropriate for the UK? Probably not as we are currently seeing a much more gradual increase in numbers and these are already distributed throughout the UK, unlike the situation in Italy where cases were concentrated in a single region. 'More rigorous social distancing measures are likely to be implemented in the UK over coming days or weeks as case numbers increase. But the timing of their introduction will be chosen to hopefully maximise the benefit whilst minimising the harm to British society.' Lazio, the region surrounding the capital Rome, saw its cases jump from 87 to 102 in a day, a sign that the virus was propagating far from the northern concentrations. Also alarming was Italy's high fatality rate: With 463 dead and 9,172 infected, Italy's fatality rate is running at five per cent, higher than the 3-4 per cent elsewhere. Dr Giovanni Rezza, head of infectious disease at the National Institutes of Health, attributed it to the fact that Italy has the world's oldest population after Japan. The median age of Italy's virus-related dead is 80. But some younger people have also been in intensive care, including the first person to test positive in the north who had not been to China. The 38-year-old Unilever worker named Mattia came to be known in Italy as Patient No 1. At the San Matteo hospital in Pavia, there was a sigh of relief after Mattia began breathing on his own Monday with just a small amount of oxygen assistance. He was moved out of intensive care to a sub-ICU unit and was speaking with doctors. 'This disease has a long life,' intensive care chief Dr Francesco Mojoli told RAI state television. 'Now we hope that the fact that he was young and in good shape will help him get back to his normal life.'"
8,White House confirms Trump has NOT been tested for coronavirus despite his new chief of staff Mark Meadows and Air Force One passenger Mike Gaetz going into quarantineÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093227/Florida-Republican-Matt-Gaetz-goes-quarantine-flying-Air-Force-One-Donald-Trump.html,"President Donald Trump has not been tested for the novel coronavirus, the White House revealed in a statement late Monday, even though he has been in contact with a slew of politicians who have gone under self-quarantine. The president refused to answer repeated questions on whether he had been tested or not for the virus during a press conference earlier on Monday. Vice President Mike Pence said he hadn't been tested and wasn't sure if Trump had been, but promised to give an answer to that question later in the evening. 'The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,'White House press secretaryStephanie Grishamsaid in a statement. 'President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.' However, that same evening Trump's new acting chief of staff Mark Meadows and Congressman Matt Gaetz, who traveled on Air Force One with the president hours earlier, both announced they were exposed to the virus and were under self-quarantine. Both Meadows and Gaetz said they were exposed after they came into contact with an individual at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last month who later tested positive for the coronavirus.  Meadows, who was appointed last week, announced he will self-isolate in his home 'out of an abundance of caution' after he was exposed to the virus. 'Meadows received testing which came back negative. While heâ€™s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors' standard precautionary recommendations, he'll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,' Meadows' spokesperson Ben Williamson said. It comes after Congressman Matt Gaetz also announced Monday he will self-quarantine after coming in contact with a person with the virus at CPAC. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Paul Gosar of Arizona, and Doug Collins of Georgia, had already announced they will quarantine as well after attending the conference. Trump has been exposed to at least three people who have gone into self-quarantine as a precaution. Those people include Gaetz, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp who shook hands with someone infected days earlier, and Rep Doug Collins who he shook hands with on Friday as they toured the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The president left a White House briefing on the disease after making a brief statement on the economic measures his administration was taking to combat the economic shake-up. He left the room and didn't answer as multiple journalists asked him if he had been tested for the virus. Vice President Mike Pence, who stayed to continue the briefing, said he has never been tested for the virus. Pence and President Trump both attended the Conservative Political Action Conference at the end of last month, where an attendee tested positive for the disease. 'Well, I just simply don't know what the White House physician has recommended in terms of the president, but I promise we'll get that information,' Pence said in the briefing room. 'We'll let you know tonight,' he added. 'Obviously the White House physicians, their directive is to see of the health and the well being of the president of the United States and we'll get you a very direct answer on that,' Pence said. As far as his own health goes, he added, 'I've had no recommendation that I be tested.' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she thought President Trump should be tested. 'I thought he should be tested for a long time now,' she told CNN Monday night on Capitol Hill. Gaetz learned after Air Force One left Orlando that he had been in touch with an infected person at CPAC, two sources told The New York Times. He then essentially quarantined himself, sitting in a section of the plane alone, the paper reported. He had spent the weekend in Florida with President Trump and several members of the first family and traveled back from the state on Air Force One with the president. 'Congressman Gaetz was informed today that he came into contact with a CPAC attendee 11 days ago who tested positive for COVID-19,' his office said in a statement. 'While the Congressman is not experiencing symptoms, he received testing today and expects results soon. Under doctor's usual precautionary recommendations, he'll remain self-quarantined until the 14-day period expires this week.' Gaetz traveled on Air Force One with President Trump on Monday when the president returned from Florida. He was spotted getting off the back of the plane, where he was met by an Air Force official and escorted to a waiting car. He was seen getting on the plane in Orlando, where he walked up the front stairs of Air Force One after the president. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  The congressman told The Washington Posthe was put into a 'closed up room' on Air Force One after he found out he might have been exposed to coronavirus. After landing, Trump 'coaxed' him up front before leaving. 'He was not hyper cautious about being in the same space that I was in,' Gaetz told the newspaper. 'I refused to go into his office, I stood outside the door. I told him he could talk from that distance,' he said. The Florida Republican wore a gas mask on the House floor last week to mock the hype surrounding the epidemic. The stunt drew enormous attention, which his office acknowledged in Monday's statement. 'Congressman Gaetz had expected COVID-19 to impact Congress, given the elevated frequency of travel and human contact, and demonstrated his concern last week on the House Floor,' Gaetz office said. His Washington D.C. office on Capitol Hill will also be closed but his Florida office will remain open. Gaetz was spotted at Mar-a-Lago Saturday night where there was a dinner forBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and a birthday party forKimberly Guilfoyle. Also spotted at Mar-a-Lago that night were President Trump, Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.; Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump;Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Tiffany Trump was also spotted in photos posted to social media. Also seen was Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney; Vice President Mike Pence; Republican Senator Lindsey Graham; and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Gaetz was spotted on Wednesday wearing the mask ahead of the vote on an emergency spending bill to fight the virus. Just two days later and health officials announced the death of a manin Santa Rosa County, which falls underGaetz's northwestern Florida district. A second elderly person in Lee County has also died. 'I'm extremely saddened to learn of the first fatality in our district from coronavirus, a Northwest Floridian residing in Santa Rosa County. Our prayers are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time,' Gaetz said in a statement. 'Reviewing the coronavirus supplemental appropriation and preparing to go vote,' Gaetz had tweeted ahead of a vote on the $8.3 billion bill to combat the spread of the virus. Gaetz, explaining his bizarre accessory,compared the House chamber to a 'petri dish' for incubating germs. 'We all fly in these dirty airports, we touch and selfie everyone we meet and then we congregate together,' the Florida congressman said. Among those who asked him to take the mask off were Ruben Gallego, a combat veteran and Arizona Democrat. The House sergeant-at-arms asked Gaetz to remove his gas mask in the chamber, citing rules against headgear. Gaetz initially protested as he walked off the House floor. 'There are provisions in the House rules that permit medically necessary headgear,' Gaetz said. Gaetz later acknowledged in a statement to The Hillthat 'House rules do not explicitly allow medical headgear even at this time of heightened concern,' adding, 'This is a rule that should be revisited.' Gaetz is the latest Republican lawmaker to voluntarily self-quarantine after a CPAC attendee was revealed to have tested positively for the disease. Republican Rep. Doug Collins also went into quarantine on Monday. Collins traveled with Trump last Friday as the president went to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and the two were photographed shaking hands. He joins Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar, as self-quarantining after the potential exposure. Cruz announced his decision Sunday night. Thousands of conservatives attended CPAC, which was addressed by President Trump, Mike Pence and a string of other loyalists. Among the guests was the mystery 55-year-old man who tested positive according to Maryland health authorities. ButMatt Schlapp, the chairman of CPAC, said he feels 'healthy as a horse' after the 'incidental contact' with the man who is now recovering in New Jersey following the event in Washington DC from February 27 to March 1. Cruz has admitted that he also shook hands with the infected man and has put himself into 14-day quarantine. 'Last night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for COVID-19,' Cruz said in a statement Sunday. 'That interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.' On Sunday, Arizona Republican Paul Gosar joined Cruz by self-quarantining. 'I am announcing that I, along with three of my senior staff, are officially under self-quarantine after sustained contact at CPAC with a person who has since been hospitalized with the Wuhan Virus.' It comes as the US coronavirus death toll climbed to 22 with another patient dying in Washington state.Grant County Health District confirmed the death without giving further details. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Schlapp was seen interacting with the likes of Ivanka Trump, Lara Trump and Jared Kushner at the event last week where he also came into contact with the infected person. 'I had incidental contact with him, very briefly... I feel healthy as a horse,'Schlapp told Fox Sunday. Schlapp said he had contacted anyone who may have had contact with the infected individual but said that person 'had no contact with either the president or the vice president'. 'I can tell you, when the president was on site at CPAC, he lives by what he tells us, because I saw him scrub down his hand and clean his hands more than once while he was on the premises, and I did the same,' Schlapp said. He added in a tweet Sunday night: 'We did ask the patient the names of everyone he spent time with. Those who interacted with the attendee were informed. The good news is NO ONE has any symptoms.' War Room podcast host Raheem Kassam said he was around the infected man and had been 'flu-sick unwell for the past week'. He claimed the infected man was around for most of the Thursday activities and noting that Gosar and Cruz were in the green room 1pm to 5pm that day, Kassam said the likes of Rep Louie Gohmert, KellyAnne Conway and Rep Matt Gaetz may be at risk. Kassam said the infected person was around on the Friday too. 'Everyone at the CPAC Shabbat dinner should be checked. The attendee was there,' Kassam tweeted Sunday. He alleged there could be a second infected person.Kassam said he and others were 'apoplectic about how they have not been better informed of what happened'. As of Sunday evening, 550 people in the US had tested positive for COVID-19 and 22 people had died. Globally 110,037 people have tested positive for coronavirus and and 3,825 people have died. President Trump previously said he's not concerned about any risk.  Cruz, however, said in his statement that he's cutting himself off from further public interaction despite medics believing he's not a risk. He also said he's notified other politicians who attended CPAC. 'I have consulted with medical authorities from the Houston Health Department, the Harris County Public Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as my personal physician,' he tweeted.'I have also spoken with Vice President Pence, Leader McConnell, and Mark Meadows.'

9,American Airlines and Delta slash domestic flights by up to 25% and Southwest CEO announces he will take a 10% pay cut as coronavirus crisis hammers airline industry,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095989/American-Airlines-Delta-slash-flights-Southwest-CEO-10-pay-cut-coronavirus.html,"Airlines across the US are continuing to feel the squeeze of the coronavirus outbreak, with firms slashing yet more flights and bosses taking pay cuts in efforts to keep the companies' heads above water. American Airlines and Delta Airlines both announced plans to cut more flights Tuesday, while Southwest Airlines CEO told employees he will take a 10% pay cut as the firm grapples withsagging passenger demand for flights. American Airlines said it will cut domestic flights by 7.5% for April andinternational flights by 10% for the summer peak travel season, includingtemporarily suspending service to several European cities, including Rome, Milan, Barcelona, Venice, Paris and Madrid. The airline, which had previously canceled all flights to China where the coronavirus outbreak began, has now extended this until at least October. It will also suspend itsfull-year and quarterly financial forecasts. Cuts to summer flight plans and beyond is an indication that the industry is now bracing for the outbreak to continue for several more months into the year. Delta also announced Tuesday that it will reduce capacity by around 15% across its network, cutting domestic flights by as much as 15% and international flights by as much as 25%. The slashing of flights consists of: Pacific flights by 65%, Trans-Atlantic by 15-20%, domestic by10-15% and Latin by 5%. Delta CEO Ed Bastain said in a statement: 'In the weeks since COVID-19 emerged, Delta people have risen to the challenge, taking every possible action to take care of and protect our customers during a stressful time. 'As the virus has spread, we have seen a decline in demand across all entities, and we are taking decisive action to also protect Delta's financial position. As a result, we have made the difficult, but necessary decision to immediately reduce capacity and are implementing cost reductions and cash flow initiatives across the organization.' The airline also announced a series of other changes to quell the impact of the global outbreak on the organisation. These includea company-wide hiring freeze and offering voluntary leave options to employees. Meanwhile, Southwest's CEO Gary Kelly has sought to take matters into his own hands, saying he will take a 10% pay cut in light of the hammering the firm has taken to passenger bookings - which he likened to the fallout from the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks. The exact pay cut is not known but, in 2018, Kelly's salary was $750,000 and his total compensation was $7.73 million, according toThe Wall Street Journal. The airline declined to confirm to DailyMail.com if the salary reduction would come to Kelly's salary or to his total take home pay. 'I can confirm Gary stated he would reduce his salary, which has not increased since 2017, by 10 percent. We are not providing any additional details on his salary cut,' the statement sent to DailyMail.com read. The toll on the company is expected to be up to $300 million in the month of March alone, the company stated: 'Gary reiterated that we are prepared and have a strong financial position, but cautioned that we are seeing an alarming drop in bookings and sales due to the Coronavirus, as we outlined in a form 8-K filing last week, with an estimated impact of $200-$300 million in the month of March alone.' In the video message toemployees on Monday, Kelly said coronavirus had created a challenge more serious than the industry has faced since 9/11, 'and it may be worse.' 'The velocity and the severity of the decline is breathtaking,' he said. It's not the first time the toll on the industry has been likened to 9/11. Industry group IATA warned in February that the reduction in global airline capacity, measured by how many seats remain grounded, had become greater than after the terrorist attacks. After 9/11, airline revenue dropped an estimated $19.6 billion in 2002 dollars. The coronavirus crisis could cost the industry an estimated $29.3 billion in lost revenue for 2020, analysts said. Tuesday's announcements follow a series of moves made by airlines in recent weeks as the spread of coronavirus ramps up across the globe. United Airlines previously announced it was slashing domestic flights by 10% and international flights by 20% in April. All flights to China and Hong Kong were axed, and South Korea was added to its travel waiver list. JetBlue said it was cutting flights by about5% in the near term. Meanwhile, across the pond, theEuropean Commission is relaxing its airport-slot rules so that airlines no longer need to fly empty planes across Europe in order to retain their takeoff and landing rights for the next season. Europe's 'use-it-or-lose-it' rules mean thatairlines must use a takeoff or landing slot at a level of at least 80% to keep their flying rights. As airlines want to avoid taking a hit to their flying rights along with passenger numbers, empty aircraft have until now become a fixture on runways. The global coronavirus outbreak has left airlines some of the hardest hit by the crisis as people fear traveling during the pandemic. In yet another blow, CDC guidance issued Monday ordered the elderly and sick to stock up on medications and avoid large crowds, cruise ships and airplanes in order to protect themselves against the deadly disease. Such advice will do little to restore faith in flying among panicked passengers. Fears are mounting after 26 people have died from the virus in the US and 765 people are now infected. The one saving grace to the industry could come in the form of the sharp drop in fuel prices, as the cost reduction from the oil price rout could be as much as $3 billion. Top airline executives, including United President Scott Kirby, American CEO Doug Parker, and Southwest's Kelly, will be speaking at JPMorgan's Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference Tuesday. The event itself will now be held via teleconference rather than its usual New York event due to the outbreak."
10,"New York City prepares for Rikers Island inmates to dig mass graves to bury up to 51,000 bodies as coronavirus cases increase",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093543/New-York-Citys-surge-plan-severe-pandemic-calls-Rikers-Island-inmates-dig-mass-graves.html,"As more coronavirus cases are reported in New York City, contingency plans are in place to prepare for a worst-case scenario that could see Rikers Island prisoners dig mass graves to bury up to 51,000 bodies. The city has plans in place for a severe pandemic whose mortality rate of 2.1 per cent would likely produce a need for quick burial of corpses. The plan was drawn up by the cityâ€™s Office of Chief Medical Examiner in October 2008 during the administration of then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The report by Charles S. Hirsch, titled â€˜Pandemic Influenza Surge Plan For Managing In- and Out-of-Hospital Deaths,â€™ details response strategies in case of widespread emergencies on the scale of the 1918 Spanish Flu and the 1957 outbreak of Asian Flu. The reportâ€™s estimates hold that most deaths from a pandemic - up to 70 per cent - would occur in hospitals or assisted living centers. During a pandemic similar to the Spanish Flu, when more than half a million Americans died, the city plans to deploy death professionals like morticians, forensic photographers, and medical students to collect the bodies. It is estimated that they would be asked to remove between 50 and 5,000 cadavers a day, according to New York magazine. During a surge in deaths, the city would deploy mobile refrigerated storage units at locations around the city. Each of these units are capable of holding up to 44 bodies each. The city would then need to accelerate the disposing of the bodies, including through cremation. If the number of corpses reaches overflow, a last resort would have the city send the bodies to Hart Island, the small island in the western Long Island Sound which lies just off the Bronx shoreline. The city would then have inmates from nearby Rikers Island dig mass graves and bury the corpses. The use of prison labor is a controversial topic, as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo learned on Monday. During a news conference in Albany, the governor introduced a new hand sanitizer that he said would be sold to New Yorkers at a cheap price if the major manufacturers engaged in price gouging during the pandemic. But the product was made by Corcraft, a state-owned business that uses prison labor. â€˜We are introducing New York State Clean hand sanitizer made conveniently by the State of New York,â€™ Cuomo said. â€˜This is a superior product to products now on the market.â€™ Cuomo, the third-term Democrat, said that it cost the state less money to manufacture the product than it would to buy it from other vendors on the open market. But advocates for criminal justice reform objected to the use of cheap prison labor during a national health crisis. â€˜Iâ€™m concerned that we are asking the incarcerated to save the public from a health crisis, but wonâ€™t give them the dignity of a fair wage,â€™ State Senator Zellnor Myrie, a first-term Democrat from Brooklyn, told The New York Times. In New York States, inmates are paid an hourly wage of 62 cents. In some cases, they get as little as 10 cents an hour, according to the Prison Policy Initiative. Myrie wants to raise the minimum wage in state prisons to $3 an hour, but a bill has stalled. As of midday Monday, there have been more than 140 cases of the new coronavirus confirmed in New York. Nearly 100 of those cases trace back to one of a community in the Westchester County suburb of New Rochelle connected to one of the first patients who tested positive in the state. Other commuter-rail suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey have also reported stray cases."
11,Why smokers have to quit NOW to avoid dying of coronavirusÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094077/Why-smokers-quit-avoid-dying-coronavirus.html,"Smokers are being urged to quit without delay to avoid catching coronavirus. People with pre-existing lung problems are particularly susceptible to be infected with the flu-like illness that originated in Chinalate last year. Dr Norman Swan, who presents Radio National's Health Report, said nicotine addicts were particularly at risk of getting sick, with more than 100 Australians now infected. 'If you are a smoker, the lining of your lungs is more vulnerable and you're producing more of the receptors which the COVID-19 virus latches on to,' he told the ABC's 7.30 program. 'So quit now - there are plenty of resources around to help you.' Diabetics and those with lung and heart problems are also at risk. 'Now is the time to make sure you're doing everything you and your GP can to make you as fit as well as possible - give yourself the best chance you can,' Dr Swan said. His warning followed one last week about bushfire volunteers being at high risk of catching coronavirus, as a result ofsmoke haze weakening their lungs. Professor Raina MacIntyre, the head of biosecurity at the University of New South Wales's Kirby Institute, said the virus was unkind to those with breathing difficulties following the spate of bushfires across Australia. 'People who had exacerbations of lung disease during the bushfires and are still not recovered from that may be worse affected,' she told Daily Mail Australia. She warned 17,000 volunteer firefighters may be at greater risk of contracting coronavirus. Dr Swan also dismissed the idea coronavirus was no worse than the seasonal flu. 'Some people are saying there's no reason to panic because it's no different from the seasonal flu and while I agree there's no need to panic, this isn't the flu,' he said. 'COVID-19 has a higher transmission rate.' Last week, the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus had a fatality rate of between 3 and 4 per cent. The seasonal flu kills about 0.1 per cent of those infected, according toAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US. Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, said: â€˜For most respiratory infections, you worry about people who smoke a bit more. 'Theyâ€™re more likely to get it and their immune system is less good. If you are going to give up smoking, this is a very good moment to do it. 'But itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m saying they should self-isolate or behave in any other way differently.â€™ NEW SOUTH WALES: 61 January 25 Three men aged 43, 53, and 35 who had recently travelled to China contracted the disease.

Reducing service to Paris (CDG) and Madrid (MAD) for parts of May and June. Norwegian Norwegian is preparing to cancel approximately 3000 flights between mid-March and mid-June. This represents approximately 15 percent of the total capacity for this period. Delta In a statement the airline said: 'We have adjusted flight schedules to affected areas, waived many change fees and are working with customers to adjust travel plans, using relationships with other airlines when needed.' United Airlines United Airlines said it would reduce U.S. and Canadian flights by 10% and international flights by 20% in April, with similar cuts planned in May. It added South Korea to its travel waiver list but is not cancelling flights. Emirates JFK airport had cancelled two flights from Milan as of Tuesday morning, with a third Emirates flight due to arrive at 7pm still showing as 'scheduled' though it is far from clear whether it will go ahead.  On Monday night, passengers arriving in the US still faced no screening. Just one flight landed in America, Emirates Flight 205 that took off from Milan and arrived at John F Kennedy Airport at 7.53pm. The new restrictions shutting down Italy were announced while the passenger jet was in the air. But travelers were furious at the lack of checks in US airports, noting that no one was being screened for COVID-19 symptoms upon landing. 'My friend just landed at JFK from Italy and they didn't even check her or anyone on her plane but they checked the plane from China. Even though all of Italy just got shut down makes total sense!' a Twitter user named Kimberly sarcastically posted Monday night. Huge numbers of flights from Italy to the US have been cancelled, but more are scheduled for the forthcoming days. United announced Tuesday that its CEO and President will waive 100 per cent of their base salaries until at least June 30, as a result of coronavirus. Other passengers complained that as the new rules were announced, it was unclear how travelers would be treated when they arrive in the US and what would happened when it was time to return to the region. Marjorie Perrelli Day tweeted at JFK's Twitter account: 'I have friends coming from Italy today from Rome. What will they have to do since Italy is now totally shut down. People have been tweeting that JFK has zero screening. So can you explain this?' A spokesman for JFK replied: 'The Port Authority is providing all necessary support for the screening currently being carried out by the @CDCgov & @CBP of passengers at its airports and any ensuing referrals for quarantine in cooperation with state and city health authorities.' President Donald Trump had vowed on March 1 that anyone returning from 'high risk countries' would be screened both before they boarded planes and once they had returned to the US. ButAtlanta airport admitted Sunday: 'People aren't being screened when they arrive from Italy/South Korea, because those countries are doing exit screenings.' Many travelers took to Twitter to share stories about returning to America from the high-risk countries with minimal to no screening. One traveler wrote on Twitter Monday: 'Flew into LAX yesterday out of Heathrow. No checks on either end and flights landing from both China and Italy at the same time. Some context, was in Tanzania and Kenya last week and they even had checks inbound and outbound. How can this be?' Trina Hayes said Monday: 'We returned from 10 days in southern Italy on Saturday night. Despite US saying no one allowed to board with a fever over 99.5, no one on our flight from Rome to JFK had a temperature check. We were not checked for any symptoms at JFK or O'Hare either.' The US embassy said: 'Italy has expanded temperature screening to all air travelers upon arrival on all international (including European) and domestic flights arriving in Italy's major airports as well as upon departure for most non-Schengen countries.' The State Department simply tells Americans to 'reconsider travel to Italy' but is still yet to issue its strongest warning of 'do not travel' apart from to hotspots Lombardy and Veneto. Leading U.S. airlines American and Delta suspended 2020 financial forecasts on Tuesday and took drastic further measures to combat the impact of the coronavirus, while Unitedannounced a capital raising and said it would post a first-quarter loss. Airlines continue to slash capacity as travelers cancel flights or avoid them all together. American Airlines cut international capacity by 10 per cent for the summer Tuesday and will trim domestic capacity by 7.5 per cent next month as millions second guess vacations or business travel. The airline is suspending flights between Los Angeles and mainland China and Hong Kong for the entire summer. It suspended flights between Philadelphia and Rome immediately Tuesday.That hold will remain in place through the end of April. Delta Air Lines on Tuesday cut international capacity by 20 per cent to 25 per cent and will reduce domestic capacity by 10 per cent to 15 per cent. It also announced a hiring freeze and is offering employees voluntary leave. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines are allowing passengers to rebook tickets through April 30 without paying fees. United announced Tuesday that its CEO and President will waive 100 per cent of their base salaries until at least June 30, as a result of coronavirus. San Francisco International Airport said itspassenger numbers are down 30 percent from the same time in 2019. The CDC have issued a Level 3 warning - their highest - to avoid all nonessential travel to Italy. They say on their website: 'To slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into the United States, CDC is working with state and local public health partners to implement after-travel health precautions. 'Depending on your travel history, you will be asked to stay home for a period of 14 days from the time you left an area with widespread or ongoing community spread (Level 3 Travel Health Notice).'Italian streets and piazzas were empty today and tourist favorites including Milan's shopping galleries, Rome's Spanish Steps and Vatican's St Peter's Square were all but deserted. Italy is facing the worst coronavirus epidemic outside of China.Around 50,000 US citizens are thought to currently reside in the country. It is not clear if the US government is developing any plans to bring them home. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte declared last night that 'everyone must give up something to protect the health of citizens' with 9,000 virus cases confirmed in Italy and 463 people dead. More than 5.6 million Americans visit Italy every year, representing 9 per cent of foreign tourists and the second-largest national group behind Germans, according to the most recent statistics. Anyone with a fever has been ordered to stay indoors with travel banned except in emergencies and public gatherings including weddings, funerals and sports fixtures shut down. The virus is spreading so quickly that doctors are now having to make life-or-death decisions about who gets access to intensive care. British Airways and Jet2 have today cancelled all their hundreds of flights to and from Italy until April at the earliest and easyJet has grounded most services. BA has axed its 60 flights a day to cities including Milan, Venice and Rome while Jet2 has gone even further and cancelled its services for almost two months until April 26. EasyJet has stopped the majority of its flights to northern Italy but planes will still fly from southern cities such as Rome and Naples despite the blanket travel ban imposed by the Italian government. As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, health experts advise plane travelers to sit in a window seat, disinfect their table trays and window blinds, and warn that wearing a mask won't prevent infection. Officials say the best way to avoid catching the virus, which is spread through viral particles within mucus or saliva, is to keep your hands clean, disinfect your space, and avoid touching your face. It is also advised that plane travelers choose a window seat to have less contact with potentially sick people. 'Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,' Vicki Stover Hertzberg, professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, said. Hertzberg helped conduct a study that followed passengers and crew members on 10 three to five-hour flights during the flu season and found that passengers who sit in the window seats had less contact with ill people. Wearing a mask on the plane may not prove helpful as the air in the aircraft is considered sterile because there are so few microorganisms at such a high altitude and the plane draws fresh air from the outside. About 50 percent of the air in cabins is recirculated but it goes through sophisticated air filters similar to those used in surgical environments, before it's its pushed back into the plane. A problem with paper masks is that they don't have a respirator to filter out infectious air articles. That means passengers are more likely to catch the virus through direct contact from someone with the virus or surfaces rather than through the air. But one study found that the other coronaviruses - such as SARS and MERS - remains on metal, glass, and plastic surfaces for up to nine days. Top tips include: - Good hand hygiene: Frequently wash hands for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitzer - Disinfect your space: Bring your own wipes and wipe down window blinds, seat belts, arm rests, touch screens and tray tables - Choose a window seat: Sit near the window and avoid moving around the cabin to limit exposure to potentially sick people - Use touch screen with a tissue: Avoid contact with surfaces that may hold the virus - Avoid touching your face: 2019-nCov is spread through viral particles in mucus or saliva. Avoid touching your face and transferring germs picked up from surfaces Prime minister Giuseppe Conte said last night's decree could be 'summarised as follows: I stay at home'. Here are the rules under the new decree. THE SICK MUST STAY AT HOME People who have tested positive for coronavirus must not leave their homes for any reason. Anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms is urged to stay at home and limit social contact, including with their doctor. NO TRAVEL ACROSS ITALY Travel is only allowed for 'urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons'. Grocery shopping is considered a 'necessity' and still allowed. To avoid work-related travel, public and private companies have been urged to put their staff on leave. However, it was not immediately clear how the new measures would be enforced. Trains and numerous flights continued to operate into and out of Milan on Monday despite the earlier restrictions in Lombardy. Public transport will remain operational, but Conte says he wants as many people as possible to stay at home. People who do want to travel will need to fill in a document explaining their reasons for doing so and carry it with them. If they are found to have lied they face fines or jail terms. But they will generally work on an honour system. People will also be allowed to travel to return home. NO PUBLIC GATHERINGS 'All forms of gatherings in public places or sites open to the public' are banned, the decree says. Cinemas, museums, theatres, pubs, dance schools, betting shops and discos are all closed. Weddings and funerals are banned. Schools and universities will remain shut until April 3. Bars and restaurants were only allowed to open between 8am and 6pm, the decree said, and only if a distance of at least 3ft could be kept between customers. Sporting events of all levels and disciplines were cancelled - stopping play in the Serie A football league. Fixtures in international competitions can go ahead but will be played behind closed doors. Gyms, sports centres, swimming pools, spas and leisure centres must close. SHOPS MUST KEEP 3FT DISTANCE Shops can remain open but only if they can guarantee the 3ft safety distance for customers. Big and mid-sized shopping centres have to close at the weekend. Food stores are allowed to remain open at all hours. NO LEAVE FOR HEALTH WORKERS Leave for health workers is cancelled. People accompanying their friends or relatives to emergency units are not allowed to stay with them in the waiting rooms without express permission. ALL OF ITALY IS COVERED The entire country, including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, is covered by the decree - covering a total population of some 60million people.  "
13,"Coachella organizers are 'in desperate talks with agents of Frank Ocean, Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott and other artists to reschedule festival for mid-October'Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8096389/Coachella-organizers-reportedly-desperate-talks-artists-reschedule-festival.html,"Coachella music festival organizers are reportedly in crisis talks to try to save the festival by postponing it until October due to coronavirus fears, but it is unclear whether the scheduling logistics will work out. The festival's promoter, Goldenvoice, is in the process now of contacting artists on the schedule to try and preserve the lineup for the weekends of October 9 and 19, according to TMZ. However, no official announcement has been made, and the festival's website still lists its dates as the originally scheduled weekends of April 10 and 17. Organizers did not immediately respond to an inquiry from DailyMail.com on Tuesday morning. It was unclear whether headline acts such as Frank Ocean, Rage Against the Machine, and Travis Scott would be available for the proposed dates in October. After three new coronavirus cases were confirmed on Monday in the Coachella Valley, where the festival is held, it seemed extremely unlikely that the event would go forward as scheduled in April â€” raising the possibility that it could be cancelled entirely if key acts are unavailable to reschedule for October. Postponing the event to October is a complex undertaking that would involve contacting hundreds of artists, and organizers are likely delaying an announcement until they can determine whether rescheduling is feasible. According to Variety, Goldenvoice may be trying to avoid triggering cancellation insurance by postponing the festival instead of cancelling it outright. Industry experts say that most festival insurance policies do not cover outbreaks of communicable diseases, meaning that Coachella organizers could be on the hook for millions if the festival is cancelled. Michael Rawlings, underwriting manager at Event Insurance Services told the Guardianthat outside of animal-based events, 'very few people would have had the foresight to have insurance against communicable disease.' The Coachella Valley region confirmed three new cases of the coronavirus on Monday. The cases were confirmed by the Riverside County Department of Public Health. Dr. Cameron Kaiser, county public health officer, said the three infections were either the result of travel into areas where COVID-19 has been confirmed or contact with a known case. Two of the individuals have been isolated at home, Kaiser said, while the third is being cared for at a Coachella Valley hospital. There were growing calls for the festival to be shut down, particularly after the coronavirus outbreak led to the cancellation of SXSW in Texas and Ultra electronic music festival in Miami. An onlinepetitionto shutter Coachella this year quickly garnered more than 16,000 signatures. 'As a highly inclusive community, we are responsible to protect each and every community member, which include the ones who are elderly, fragile, or the ones who suffers from chronic diseases, cancer, immune system diseases and other form of disabilities,' wrote Stella Young, who started the petition. 'The lives of these people should not be downplayed and we shouldn't risk their lives since they have a higher chance catching COVID-19 and develop critical situations that need to be hospitalized,' Young wrote. Coachella is a hugely popular festival with social media influencers, who preen in selfies during the two-weekend event. Each spring hundreds of thousands of festival-goers descend on the grounds of Indio over two three-day weekends. It typically draws 250,000 people over two weekends. The country-flavored Stagecoach Festival, featuring headliner Carrie Underwood, is scheduled for April 24-26 at the same Indio venue. It is likely that if Coachella is postponed, the Stagecoach Festival would also be moved back to a later date. This year Rage Against The Machine, Frank Ocean and Travis Scott are set to headline. If the reports of a postponement are accurate, this would be the second major event in the region that has been either postponed or canceled due to the emerging pandemic. Professional tennis organizers announced the postponement of the BNP Paribas Open in Southern California. The announcement has jolted the Coachella Valley's economy during peak tourist season in the desert. The two-week tournament's economic impact to the area topped $400million in the most recent survey done in 2017. It was set to run Monday through March 22. Based on the survey it has attracted upwards of 450,000 people, including 124,000 from outside the region. 'It's one of our biggest events of the year,' Scott White, president and CEO of the Greater Palm Springs Convention & Visitors Bureau, said by phone Monday. 'This is a tough one to get through. I think a lot of people were very surprised by the postponement.' Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  White said the bureau would begin surveying hoteliers and area attractions Tuesday to find out the impact of not holding the tournament at this time after a case of coronavirus was confirmed in the Coachella Valley. He said hotels and restaurants are using enhanced cleaning methods to protect guests and workers. The Riverside County Public Health Department declared a public health emergency for the desert cities 110 miles east of Los Angeles, including Indian Wells where the ATP and WTA tours were to play the combined event that offers prize money of over $17million. Riverside County health officials on Monday announced three new novel coronavirus cases in the Coachella Valley, bringing the area total to six. The US death toll from the coronavirus has climbed to 27, with most of the victims in Washington state, while the number of infections swelled to over 680 spread across more than half the states. On Friday, city officials in Austin, Texas issued a state of emergency that effectively cancelled another major festival, South by Southwest, also known as SXSW, which had been set to take place between March 13 and March 22. It is just the latest cancellation of a major festival or conference due to coronavirus fears, following the cancellation of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, as well as Facebook F8 and Adobe Summit. All told, the economic cost of tech events cancelled due to coronavirus has surpassed $1 billion, according to an estimate from ReCode. An economic impact report found that last year's SXSW festival, attended by more than 400,000, contributed $355.9million to the local economy, making the cancellation a devastating blow to Austin businesses. The SXSW announcement comes on the heels of Miami authorities saying they were cancelling the Florida beachfront city's annual Ultra electronic dance festival -- which draws in more than 160,000 revelers - over coronavirus threats. The March 20 to 22 event was to feature sets from major DJs including Gesaffelstein and Sofi Tukker. Ultra has also canceled its edition of the festival in Abu Dhabi, which was scheduled for March 5-6. The epidemic poses a particular challenge for Miami, which relies on tourism especially in March and April, when thousands of young people fly south for spring break."
14,'I have practiced for 30 years and nothing has worried me like this': Doctor demands schools shut IMMEDIATELY as he reveals three YOUNG men near LA celebrity suburb Calabasas are 'very ill' after contracting coronavirus on Italian ski trip,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094515/Doctor-treating-coronavirus-patients-LA-suburb-calls-schools-shut-immediately.html,"A California doctor has urged officials to close down local schools immediately as he revealed he was treating three 'very ill' young men with coronavirus near the Los Angeles celebrity suburb of Calabasas. The three men, who were part of a group of 14 on a skiing holiday, traveled back to the United States on February 27 after visiting Cortina d'Ampezzo in Northern Italy's Dolomite Mountains, DailyMail.com previously revealed. Dr Sam Fink, who is a primary care physician treating coronavirus patients in Tarzana - the Los Angeles suburb just 10 miles from Kim Kardashian's Calabasas home, has warned that the disease is unlike anything he has ever seen. They friends the men were traveling with have all tested positive for coronavirus. Dr Frink said one of his patients is being treated at the Tarzana Medical Center, the second is being treated at another facility and that he is friends with a third patient. 'I have practiced for over 30 years, and have seen it all, or so I thought. Nothing has worried me like this,' he wrote on Facebook on Sunday, adding that he has beenshocked to see the impact of the fast-spreading virus. 'Essentially, 14 men went on a ski trip to Northern Italy. All have become ill, and all 14 have tested positive for coronavirus. Of the 14, four needed to be hospitalized, and of the four patients, three are very ill as I write this. One had a significant pre-existing medical condition. The other three did not, and are relatively young.' The Los Angeles County Health Department has confirmed eight cases of coronavirus among a group of travelers who recently returned from northern Italy. Sources told DailyMail.com that the other members of the group, who reside elsewhere in the US and abroad, have also fallen ill since returning home. One of the men, an American living in Switzerland, is understood to be in a coma. 'The news out of Northern Italy today is not good,' Dr Fink said as he urged the public to take measures beyond vigorous hand washing and hand sanitizing. He also urged schools to close and locals to avoid big groups. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most common symptoms are: Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  'I recommend to all who read this that you avoid going to large group events such as sporting events, and concerts,' he said.'I believe that all schools should be closed immediately and classes conducted online, which is relatively simple. I know that so far, children infected with CV have done relatively well, but they might come home and hug Grandpa, who won't do so well. 'Avoid contact with others as much as possible. CV in the United States is at a relatively early stage, but it won't last there for long. Make sure you have any medications you need, as well as supplies, but panicking hurts all of us,' Fink warned. Dr Fink noted that while US cases of coronavirus are just a fraction of what is going on abroad, it was only a matter of time before the epidemic grows. 'My biggest hope is that I am totally wrong, and that you will all wonder in a few weeks what the hell I was talking about. But I have a pretty good track record, and I think you should take steps now to protect yourselves and your family. There is little cost to taking extra precaution right now, and the earlier, the better.' Pam Angel revealed last week that her husband and two adult sons were among the group who returned from the Italian ski trip. She said her husband and one son were in self-quarantine, while her other son was being treated in hospital with underlying health issues. 'He can't talk without coughing. He feels like he has a pallet of bricks on his chest, he's not eating,' she told KCBS-TV about her ill son. A fourth man, a US citizen who was also on the trip, is said to be in a coma in Switzerland, where he now resides. The rest of the men who were on the trip, who were said to be 'previously healthy guys in their 40s and 50s' have all since fallen ill, with one coughing up blood, according to sources. They live in states across the US, including Arizona where six cases have been reported. Italy has been hard-hit by the coronavirus where more than 9,000 people have tested positive for the diseases, and more than 400 people have died as of Monday evening.Northern Italy has seen the highest concentration of infection cases and on Monday Italy announced a country-wide lockdown affecting its 60 million people. In the US there are more than 750 cases of coronavirus and 26 deaths.In California alone there are 143 cases and two deaths. A woman in her 60s died in Santa Clara County on Monday.Last week, a man in his 70s died in Placer County after getting off the Grand Princess cruise ship. The outbreak has prompted concerned officials to heed the warnings of medical experts with school announcing closures in California and other parts of the country. UC Berkely announced Monday it will suspend most in-person classes starting from Tuesday. Stanford University also announced it would hold only online classes last week. USC is testing online classes this week. Harvard students have been told not to return to class after the spring break, and classes will resume online. Meanwhile, Northern California's largest school district in Sacramento County is closed this week.Only a small handful of California schools have closed and some have been temporary closed for cleaning. Harkham Hillel Hebrew Academy in Beverly Hills will be closed until at least Thursday. Clifton Middle School in Monrovia was deep-cleaned Thursday after officials became aware that a person who might have the virus had been on campus, according to the Los Angeles Times. Meanwhile, thousands of passengers aboard a cruise ship struck by the coronavirus waited anxiously on Tuesday for their chance to leave the vessel, even if it meant being shipped to military bases for weeks of quarantine. After days of being forced to idle off the Northern California coast, the Grand Princess docked Monday at the Port of Oakland with some 3,500 passengers and crew on board. About two dozen people who need acute medical care were taken off the ship, although it wasn't clear how many had tested positive for the new virus, according to Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. Many of the nearly 240 Canadians on board left the ship after the critically ill and stood outside two tents displaying Canadian flags. Canada and the UK were among the countries sending chartered flights to retrieve their citizens. But some 2,000 passengers, including hundreds of Californians, were still aboard by the time disembarkation ended Monday night. It was to resume on Tuesday morning, the captain told passengers. The Grand Princess had been held off the coast since Wednesday because of evidence that it was the breeding ground for more than 20 infections tied to a previous voyage. US passengers will be flown or bused from the port - chosen for its proximity to an airport and a military base - to bases in California, Texas and Georgia for testing and a 14-day quarantine. Some arrived on Monday night at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California. The ship carried people from 54 countries and foreigners were to be whisked home. About 1,100 crew members, 19 of whom have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere after passengers are unloaded, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said. The California governor and Oakland mayor sought to reassure people that none of the cruise ship passengers would be exposed to the public before completing the quarantine. Officials were trying to decide where the ship and its crew would go next. Cruise ships have come under scrutiny by those who view them as potential germ factories because they pack thousands of people in close quarters. Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public health failure. A third vessel, the Caribbean Princess, was supposed to dock in Grand Cayman on Monday but the cruise line said it will keep its thousands of passengers and crews from disembarking until crew members are tested for COVID-19. Around the world, nations have limited the movements of millions of people in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Italy was to impose travel restrictions and other strict public health measures nationwide starting Tuesday. In Northern California, Santa Clara County announced a ban of all large gatherings of at least 1,000 people for the rest of the month in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The virus has shaken global markets, with stocks taking their worst one-day beating on Wall Street since 2008 and oil prices suffering their most brutal losses since the start of the 1991 Gulf War. Even with Asian markets posting modest gains Tuesday, fear was rampant that economies stood at the brink of recession. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done after an outbreak in the Seattle area. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Donald Trump has NOT been tested for coronavirus despite his new chief of staff Mark Meadows going into quarantine along with Air Force One passenger Matt Gaetzwho revealed Trump asked to see him DESPITE fears he has virus President Donald Trump has not been tested for the novel coronavirus, the White House revealed in a statement late Monday, even though he has been in contact with a slew of politicians who have gone under self-quarantine. The president refused to answer repeated questions on whether he had been tested or not for the virus during a press conference earlier on Monday. Vice President Mike Pence said he hadn't been tested and wasn't sure if Trump had been, but promised to give an answer to that question later in the evening. 'The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,'White House press secretaryStephanie Grishamsaid in a statement. 'President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.' However, that same evening Trump's new acting chief of staff Mark Meadows and Congressman Matt Gaetz, who traveled on Air Force One with the president hours earlier, both announced they were exposed to the virus and were under self-quarantine. Both Meadows and Gaetz said they were exposed after they came into contact with an individual at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last month who later tested positive for the coronavirus. Meadows, who was appointed last week, announced he will self-isolate in his home 'out of an abundance of caution' after he was exposed to the virus. 'Meadows received testing which came back negative. While heâ€™s experiencing zero symptoms, under doctors' standard precautionary recommendations, he'll remain at home until the 14 day period expires this Wednesday,' Meadows' spokesperson Ben Williamson said. It comes after Congressman Matt Gaetz also announced Monday he will self-quarantine after coming in contact with a person with the virus at CPAC. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Paul Gosar of Arizona, and Doug Collins of Georgia, had already announced they will quarantine as well after attending the conference. Trump has been exposed to at least three people who have gone into self-quarantine as a precaution. Those people include Gaetz, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp who shook hands with someone infected days earlier, and Rep Doug Collins who he shook hands with on Friday as they toured the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The president left a White House briefing on the disease after making a brief statement on the economic measures his administration was taking to combat the economic shake-up. He left the room and didn't answer as multiple journalists asked him if he had been tested for the virus. Vice President Mike Pence, who stayed to continue the briefing, said he has never been tested for the virus. Pence and President Trump both attended the Conservative Political Action Conference at the end of last month, where an attendee tested positive for the disease. 'Well, I just simply don't know what the White House physician has recommended in terms of the president, but I promise we'll get that information,' Pence said in the briefing room. 'We'll let you know tonight,' he added. 'Obviously the White House physicians, their directive is to see of the health and the well being of the president of the United States and we'll get you a very direct answer on that,' Pence said. As far as his own health goes, he added, 'I've had no recommendation that I be tested.' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she thought President Trump should be tested. 'I thought he should be tested for a long time now,' she told CNNMonday night on Capitol Hill. Gaetz learned after Air Force One left Orlando that he had been in touch with an infected person at CPAC, two sources told The New York Times. He then essentially quarantined himself, sitting in a section of the plane alone, the paper reported. He had spent the weekend in Florida with President Trump and several members of the first family and traveled back from the state on Air Force One with the president. 'Congressman Gaetz was informed today that he came into contact with a CPAC attendee 11 days ago who tested positive for COVID-19,' his office said in a statement. 'While the Congressman is not experiencing symptoms, he received testing today and expects results soon. Under doctor's usual precautionary recommendations, he'll remain self-quarantined until the 14-day period expires this week.' Gaetz traveled on Air Force One with President Trump on Monday when the president returned from Florida. He was spotted getting off the back of the plane, where he was met by an Air Force official and escorted to a waiting car. He was seen getting on the plane in Orlando, where he walked up the front stairs of Air Force One after the president. The congressman told The Washington Posthe was put into a 'closed up room' on Air Force One after he found out he might have been exposed to coronavirus. After landing, Trump 'coaxed' him up front before leaving. 'He was not hyper cautious about being in the same space that I was in,' Gaetz told the newspaper. 'I refused to go into his office, I stood outside the door. I told him he could talk from that distance,' he said.     By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready."
15,China prepares to declare VICTORY over coronavirus outbreak as President Xi visits quarantined residents in Wuhan and city closes ALL of its 14 makeshift hospitalsÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094489/Chinas-Xi-pays-visit-virus-epicentre-Wuhan.html,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited Wuhan for the first time since the city emerged as the centre of the coronavirus epidemic in January - a major sign that Beijing believes the outbreak is under control. The timing of Xi's visit indicates that China is ready to declare victory over the health crisis, which has killed at least 3,136 people in the nation and 4,062 worldwide, according to experts. Xi today inspected a 1,000-bed hospital constructed in 10 days to fight the deadly disease before touring a local community to call on residents in quarantine. His visit came as Wuhan authorities have closed all of the city's 14 makeshift 'fang cang' hospitals - which were converted from sports halls and exhibition centres - after they treated some 12,000 patients. It also came as unprecedented quarantine measures that have sealed off the city of 11 million and the rest of central Hubei province since late January appear to have paid off, with new infections dropping dramatically in recent weeks. China's progress stands in stark contrast with the growing global crisis, with cases now growing at a faster pace abroad, and Italy enacting its nationwide lockdown. More than 100 countries are now fighting the contagion, which has infected over 114,400 people globally. A video released by China's state broadcaster CCTV shows Xi, who arrived by plane in Hubei's capital, wearing a mask as he spoke via video-link to front-line medical workers and patients in Huoshenshan or Fire God Mountain Hospital. Huoshenshan started treating patients from February 4 after being built from the ground in just 10 days to combat the fast-spreading infection. Its sister facility, Leishenshan or Thunder God Mountain Hospital, was completed in 12 days. Xi then went to Wuhan's Donghu New City community at noon to visit people in quarantine and community workers, CCTV said. Another clipshows the locals waiving at Xi from their balconies and a mask-donning Xi greeting them back while walking in the neighbourhood. Xi is also filmed talking to community volunteers in charge of distributing necessities and carrying out health campaigns. Xi's neighbourhood tour came just five days after China'sVice Premier Sun Chunlan was heckled during an inspection by the city's isolated residents who reportedly complained about being neglected. A video shows the locals chanting 'fake, fake' out of their windows as they allegedly claimed that Sun was being shown a 'fake' delivery of food. The last of Wuhan's 14 makeshift 'fang cang' hospitals closed today after treating 1,124 coronavirus patients, according to officials. The Wuchang 'fang cang' hospital, which had been converted from Hongshan Gymnasium, discharged its last 49 patients at a closing ceremony, said the Wuhan government through its official social media account. Wuchang hospital was the first 'fang cang' facility to open in the city. It started to receive patients from February 5 and operated continuously for 34 days. A total of 833 patients recovered after being treated there and 291 people were transferred to other medical facilities, authorities announced. The city's health authorities ordered workers to turn sports halls and exhibition centres into temporary coronavirus medical centres on February 3. Fourteen such facilities were set up, treating more than 12,000 people who suffered minor coronavirus infections. On March 1, the 'fang cang' hospitals in WuhanGymnasium in Qiaokou District became the first makeshift facility to close. Two others shut on March 6 and March 8 respectively and another two discharged their last patients yesterday. China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is usually a daily fixture in state media but has stayed out of the spotlight for much of the crisis and assigned Premier Li Keqiang to oversee the response to the epidemic. Li and Vice Premier Sun have already visited the virus-stricken city of Wuhan. But as the number of new cases has fallen in recent weeks, state media has played up Xi's role in the fight against the outbreak, releasing a speech last month in which he said he had been giving instructions since early January. Hua Po, an independent Beijing-based political analyst, told AFP the trip's timing indicated an 'interim victory' for China. 'His visit is to signal that the outbreak has been effectively curbed, and is an attempt to quieten external criticism of him not going to the front lines,' said Hao. China state newspaper has urged its people to strive towards the 'victory of a people's war' against the epidemic. People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the nation's Communist Party, said in a commentarytoday: 'At the moment, thecontrol and prevention efforts against the disease are moving in a positive and good direction nationwide. The resumption of economic and social development is accelerating. 'At the same time, the epidemic situation in the province of Hubei and the city of Wuhan, in particular, is still complex and severe. And one should not neglect a possible rebound of the epidemic in other areas. 'At this time in particular, [we] should enhance the party's leadership comprehensively and work around the people to boost the people's power for seizing the victory of the people's war in controlling the epidemic.' Authorities have faced rare and fierce criticism online over their handling of the virus, with local officials coming under particular scrutiny for punishing whistle-blowers in an apparent attempt to cover up the outbreak in early January. 'During the worst of the outbreak, Xi avoided the epicentre because he did not want to be blamed, but when the situation gets better, he shows up in order to receive praise,' said Bruce Lui, a senior lecturer in journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University. The death of doctor Li Wenliang, who died from the COVID-19 illness in February, sparked a wave of grief and anger online. He was among a group of people who had raised the alarm as early as December. The virus is believed to have emerged in December at a market that sold wild animals in Wuhan before ballooning into a national and then a global epidemic. More than 4,000 people have died and over 110,000 have been infected worldwide, with the majority in China. But China reported only 17 new cases in Wuhan on Tuesday, the lowest figure since it started publishing data on January 21, and two elsewhere that were imported from abroad. 'Xi doesn't want to be associated with the disaster, but with the recovery,' said Adam Ni, a researcher at the China Policy Centre in Canberra. 'China has turned the corner now with COVID-19, and the party now wants to craft the most positive narrative despite early missteps.' Hua, the Chinese analyst, said the main reason for Xi's visit is because the outbreak has put tremendous pressure on the world's second-largest economy and needs to get back to work. 'Xi wants to uplift people, and his visit suggests a gradual return to normal life and work,' Hua said. With 56 million locked down in Hubei, authorities are now considering the possibility of lifting travel restrictions in low-risk areas to prepare for resuming work and manufacturing, state media reported on Tuesday."
16,"China halted coronavirus using a 'social nuclear weapon' of extreme measures that other countries around the world will struggle to replicate, expert warns",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095965/China-halted-coronavirus-using-social-nuclear-weapon-extreme-measures.html,"China halted the coronavirus using a 'social nuclear weapon' of extreme measures that other countries will struggle to replicate, an expert has warned. Nicholas A. Christakis,Sterling Professor of Social & Natural Science at Yale University, took to Twitter yesterday to explain how China has managed to rapidly de-escalate the threat of COVID-19 within its borders. Christakis argues that China's unique collectivist culture, and authoritarian government, have allowed it to combat the disease quickly and efficiently. 'It [China] is well suited to fight a pandemic, if it indeed takes in factual information and responds rationally,' Christiakis tweeted. Earlier today, President Xi Jinping, told reporters that the disease had been 'basically curbed' in Hubei province and Wuhan. China has 80,754 confirmed infections and a death tally of 3,136. Christiakis traces China's success back to January 23, when the People's Party imposed movement restrictions on provinces of over 930 million people. In early February, at least 48 cities and four provinces in China went further, issuing official notices for lockdown policies, with measures ranging from 'closed-off management', where residents of a community have to be registered before they are allowed in or out, to restrictions that shut down highways, railways and public transport systems. '[Closed-off management may] include: movement of people & vehicles is checked with an exit-entrance permit[sic]; body temperature at entrance of community is checked; disinfection of vehicles; food delivery; permits for only one person per household to go out,' Christiakis said. The permits printed for the purpose of moving around the city, Christakis said, are stamped with Chinese collectivist slogans, such as 'It is everyone's responsibility to fight the virus'. Another aspect of 'closed-off management' is the redirection of the labour force to serve the citizens trapped indoors. In many regions, workers are being retrained and redirected to deliver food to the public. In some cities, people can only shop with a permit, or only one member of the family can leave the property, Christakis said. Children are now being taught from the safety of their home from Skype. China is gradually lifting restrictions but officials are beginning to implement planning for the future, with inventive ideas being rolled out across the country, Christiakis said. One example is the sectioning of elevators into four equal parts, so that people keep an appropriate distance from each other. In the lift, the sign reads: 'No more than four people in the elevator. Please be patient and wait for the next elevator.' Agalvanising message below reads: 'Let's unite together to fight the virus in this special period.' China's unique political and social environment is what has helped it to combat the virus so efficiently,Christakis claimed. He said the US will struggle to mirror this with the tools at its disposal.

17,All aboard the quarantine bus: Hundreds of Americans evacuated from Grand Princess cruise ship are driven off to military bases after FINALLY being released following coronavirus outbreak onboard,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095143/Coronavirus-Americans-evacuated-Grand-Princess-cruise-ship-driven-quarantine.html,"Hundreds of Americans evacuated from the Grand Princess cruise ship late Monday were driven away to be quarantined at military bases amid fears they may have contracted coronavirus after 21 people got sick. Two dozen people in need to acute medical care were also among Monday's evacuees, alongside 240 Canadians who were loaded on specially-chartered evacuation flights home to start a quarantine of their own. Around 2,000 people - including 140 Britons - were left on the ship overnight, anxiously waiting for disembarkation to restart on Tuesday morning for their chance to leave. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most common symptoms are: Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  The UK Foreign Office said a flight to take the Britons home would arrive in California late Tuesday, due to arrive home on Wednesday morning. The Grand Princess was forced to idle off the coast of California for several days after a coronavirus outbreak was confirmed on board, but finally made port in Oakland on Monday and an evacuation started. US authorities decided not to quarantine people on board the ship after similar efforts on board another Princess Cruises ship - the Diamond Princess - failed, sickening more than 700 people and leading to six deaths. 'Everyone was hollering and clapping' as the giant vessel sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge and entered the harbor, passenger Karen Schwartz Dever said. Carolyn Wright, 63, of Santa Fe, New Mexico, could look out of her cabin window as passengers lined up. Around them, she noted, were people in yellow protective clothing, gloves and even a few hazardous materials suits. For days, passengers aboard the ship had been isolated in their cabins. When they were finally allowed a few minutes on deck, she said, they were warned to wear masks and try to stay 6 feet away from each other. But after docking, video showed long lines forming for the processing tents. Ambulances were on hand to take some passengers away. 'They were cueing up the passengers like cattle,' Wright said. 'Everybody was bunched up. They were physically touching each other and they were backed up along the gangplank.' Then, she said, they were taken away in chartered buses. 'I'm just totally freaked out by that,' said Wright. 'It's outrageous. If that's safe, then why were we stuck in our rooms? It's been stressed for the past five days that we're not to have any contact with any other passengers?' 'We're trying to stay calm and were trying to stay positive but it's getting harder and harder. They can't make up their minds how to keep us safe,' said Wright's cabin mate, Beryl Ward, 77, of Santa Fe. 'The president didn't even want us to get off the ship. So that didn't make me happy,' she added. 'Wish you were here, Mr. Trump!' On Sunday, before the ship docked, Dr. John Redd of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had urged passengers to remain in their rooms and said: 'We're making every effort to get them off the ship as safely and quickly as possible.' He called the elaborate but quickly planned disembarkation process a 'really unprecedented and difficult operation.' The Grand Princess had been held off the coast since Wednesday because of evidence that it was the breeding ground for more than 20 infections tied to a previous voyage. U.S. passengers will be flown or bused from the port - chosen for its proximity to an airport and a military base - to bases in California, Texas and Georgia for testing and a 14-day quarantine. Some arrived Monday night at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California. The ship carried people from 54 countries, and foreigners were to be whisked home. But Wright and others said nobody had been told the details. Only about 50 people had been tested for the virus. 'I'm willing to be quarantined,' Wright said. ''But I want to know if I'm positive or not. We don't even know if we're going to get tested. It's all rumor and speculation.' 'I'm bored and frustrated,' she added. 'All of a sudden a two-week vacation has turned into a five-week vacation.' Passengers need to worry about who is looking after their children or pets, not to mention preparing their taxes before the deadline and earning a living. A professional photographer, she was looking at five weeks without earning a salary. About 1,100 crew members, 19 of whom have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere after passengers are unloaded, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said. The California governor and Oakland mayor sought to reassure people that none of the cruise ship passengers would be exposed to the public before completing the quarantine. Officials were trying to decide where the ship and its crew would go next. Cruise ships have come under scrutiny by those who view them as potential germ factories because they pack thousands of people in close quarters. Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public health failure. A third vessel, the Caribbean Princess, was supposed to dock in Grand Cayman on Monday but the cruise line said it will keep its thousands of passengers and crews from disembarking until crew members are tested for COVID-19. Around the world, nations have limited the movements of millions of people in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Italy was to impose travel restrictions and other strict public health measures nationwide starting Tuesday. In Northern California, Santa Clara County announced a ban of all large gatherings of at least 1,000 people for the rest of the month in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement Monday came hours after the public health department announced the county's first coronavirus death, a woman in her 60s. The virus has shaken global markets, with stocks taking their worst one-day beating on Wall Street since 2008 and oil prices suffering their most brutal losses since the start of the 1991 Gulf War. Even with Asian markets posting modest gains Tuesday, fear was rampant that economies stood at the brink of recession. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. The virus has infected 600 people in the United States, and at least 26 have died, most in Washington state. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done after an outbreak in the Seattle area. Pearl Jam on Monday announced it was postponing 17 North American shows on its upcoming tour over coronavirus concerns. In Silicon Valley, NASA's Ames Research Center is essentially closed with restricted access because an employee tested positive Sunday for the coronavirus. Workers will be on 'mandatory telework status' and three earth science airplane missions are being delayed to later this year, the county said. Several universities have begun online-only courses, including the University of Washington, Stanford University and Columbia University.

18,Why latex gloves are the new face masks! Stars including Sylvester Stallone and Joan Collins cover their hands amid coronavirus outbreak - but experts warn they give 'false sense of security' and hand-washing is more effectiveÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8095309/Are-gloves-set-new-face-masks.html,"Celebrities have been spotted wearing latex gloves in recent days in a bid to protect themselves from the growing coronavirus threat - but experts have advised against following their lead. The World Health Organisation, Public Health England and the NHShave all urged members of the public to prioritise good personal, respiratory and hand hygiene over ineffective behaviour like wearing latex gloves and face masks. Dr Claudia Pastides, a London-based GP for healthcare app Babylon, told FEMAIL the droplets that transmit COVID-19 can be spread even on gloves, adding: 'Gloves provide a false sense of security and make people less likely to wash their hands with soap and water, which is the most important thing to do.' However that hasn't stopped high profile stars like Sylvester Stallone, Dame Joan Collins and reality star Joey Essex from wearing latex gloves in public. Stallone was spotted protecting his hands while packing his bags at a Whole Foods in Beverly Hills yesterday, while Dame Joan, 86, sported a pair while arriving at LAX for her flight to London on Sunday. Joey Essex wore gloves and a hat for lunch with Friends in London over the weekend and Naomi Campbell proved she can model anything when she showed off a pair of pink latex gloves on Instagram last week. Meanwhile Queen, 93, made headlines last week when she wore gloves during an investiture ceremony for the first time, in a signal that even the royal family is wary of the health risks posed by the deadly illness. It comes as COVID-19 tightens its grip on Europe. The death toll in Italy increased by 133 to 366 yesterday while the number of cases skyrocketed from 1,492 to 7,375. The UK has confirmed 278 coronavirus cases and three deaths. But health experts have warned members of the public against jumping in on the trend, saying they could simply give individuals a 'false sense of security'. A spokesperson for Public Health England has said previously: 'PHE is not recommending the use of gloves as a protective measure against COVID-19 for the general public. Health organisations including the WHO, NHS and Public Health England have not advised members of the public to wear surgical masks or latex gloves. A spokesperson for Public Health England has said previously: 'PHE is not recommending the use of gloves as a protective measure against COVID-19 for the general public. 'People concerned about the transmission of infectious diseases should prioritise good personal, respiratory and hand hygiene.' Similar advice was given regarding the wearing of face masks. Public Health England has warned that there is 'very little evidence' that masks are effective 'outside of clinical settings' such as hospitals. Meanwhile the World Health Organisation said masks had to be combined with good hand hygiene and other measures for them to have any positive effect. 'People concerned about the transmission of infectious diseases should prioritise good personal, respiratory and hand hygiene.' The NHS added there is 'little evidence' that they are effective for members of the public. Dr Pastides agreed: 'COVID-19 spreads in 2 ways. Firstly, through inhaling virus-filled droplets that are released when infected people talk, cough and sneeze and secondly, when people touch a surface with virus-filled droplets on it and then put their hand into their mouth, eyes or nose. 'Wearing gloves will prevent the droplets getting on the skin of your hands, but they can still be carried on and spread by gloves. If you touch your nose/eyes or mouth with gloves on, you are still at risk of being infected. 'Gloves provide a false sense of security and make people less likely to wash their hands with soap and water, which is the most important thing to do.' Dr Claudia urged people not to wear latex gloves unless they are in a healthcare setting. 'It is not recommended and there is no evidence to suggest it will be at all helpful,' she said. Similar advice has been handed out regarding face masks, which have become an increasingly common sighting in airports, on streets and on public transport around the world. However Public Health England has warned that there is 'very little evidence' that masks are effective 'outside of clinical settings' such as hospitals. The way you wear a mask is crucially importantly, academics say, because unless it is tight to the nose and mouth contaminated sneezes and coughs will get through - or linger on the surface. The World Health Organisation said masks had to be combined with good hand hygiene and other measures for them to have any positive effect."
19,New York subway looks empty during morning rush hour as coronavirus panic becomes real,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095695/New-Yorkers-avoid-subway-trains-morning-rush-hour-commute.html,"The New York City public transportation system appeared to be quite empty during Tuesday morning's rush hour commute as New Yorkers heeded Mayor Bill de Blasio's warning to stay off the subway trains due to the spread of the new coronavirus. Though trains were less crowded during rush hour, some people were still seen going about their everyday commute. Even stations like Columbus Circle in Manhattan were far less crowded than usual. Photos showed wary New Yorkers wearing protective gloves and masks while heading to work. On Monday, de Blasio urged people to walk or ride a bike to work and said that residents shouldavoid using the subway unless it is essential after the number of coronavirus cases in the state surged to 148. The mayor also said thatpeople who are ill should stay off public transit if they can. 'When we're all packed like sardines at rush hour, you're really close to your fellow New Yorkers. We'd like people, if they're sick, not even to be in that situation,' de Blasio said. Scroll down for video Subway trains remained full during rush hours, though Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said at a briefing that anecdotal evidence suggests they have been less crowded in recent days. 'We're urging employers to let people change the times that they're coming into work and change the times that they're leaving work so that we can stagger people and have less crowding,' interim New York City Transit head Sarah Feinberg said Monday. 'I can see that happening.' A DailyMail.com request for comment to the MTA was not immediately returned. Feinberg is filling in for NY/NJ's Port Authority chief, Rick Cotton,has tested positive for coronavirus. Cotton, who is working from home,had been on the ground at various airports, which the Port Authority controls. Members of his team are being tested and are currently being self-quarantined. Many people took advantage of the city's bike share program, Citi Bike, that docking stations in Lower Manhattan ran out of space in the morning. Natalie Davis takes the subway into Manhattan from Brooklyn to her job with The Nature Conservancy and said concerns about the virus haven't made her change her routine. The 31-year-old added, though, that she's noticed people acting differently near the subway entrance at the World Trade Center, where she and two co-workers were soliciting donations. 'Usually we high-five people and they're into it, but in the last two weeks or so people have been like, ""Hey, that's OK, I'm good,""' she said. Joan Chiverton, a freelance illustrator who was waiting at a subway station on Manhattan's Upper West Side, said:'I try not to touch the railings and the turnstiles with my hands.' 'I also try to stand away from people who cough. I do that normally, but now I'm actually moving away from people and not worrying if it looks like I'm being rude.' Nearly 100 of the coronavirus cases in New York trace back to one community in the Westchester County suburb of New Rochelle where one of the first patients tested positive in the state. Despite warning commuters to stay off the subway trains on Monday, de Blasio said on Tuesday thatthere will be no widespread school closures for now and insists there won't be an Italy-style lockdown as he confirmed five new coronavirus cases in the city. There are now 25 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York City. De Blasio said that New York City will not close down to contain the coronavirus outbreak. 'We cannot shut down because of undue fear,' de Blasio told MSNBC's Morning Joe. 'I would advise against these mass closures when we're keeping this situation relatively contained...ask me in a week, ask me in a month - it might change.' He is also currently not considering widespread closures to public schools. Health officials have previously said school closures in the city would be a last resort. The outbreak has resulted in a number of mostly private schools canceling or suspending in person classes.In New York City, Columbia University, Yeshiva University and New York University announced that classes would be canceled or offered online. Other commuter-rail suburbs in Connecticut and New Jersey have also reported stray cases. New Jersey reported 11 cases and Connecticut has reported two. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered. Government and transit officials have stressed that the virus can't easily be transmitted by casual contact, such as sharing a subway car with someone who is infected. But they also have urged people to walk or ride a bike to work, telecommute or stagger their work hours so they don't ride at peak times. The latter strategy was also used by the city during the 1918 influenza epidemic. The MTA is the nation's largest transit system and operates the city's subways and buses in addition to the Long Island Rail Road and MetroNorth rail systems stretching to the tip of Long Island and north to New Haven, Connecticut. The agency has accelerated its cleaning operations to disinfect several hundred subway and rail stations and thousands of buses, subway and train cars. MTA chairman and CEO Pat Foye said Monday that over the weekend more than 4,000 subway cars, 2,500 trains and 5,300 buses were cleaned. 'I want to assure the public that the subways remain safe, ' he said. New York Gov Andrew Cuomo joked last week that riders shouldn't be alarmed if they smell a strange chemical odor on the subways in the weeks ahead. 'It's not bad cologne or perfume; it is bleach,' Cuomo said. Similar train cleaning measures have been put in place in other major cities hit by the outbreak. Japan, like New York, has urged flexible working hours to reduce overcrowding on trains. Italy added dispensers of hand disinfectant to trains run by state railways before restricting residents from traveling in parts of the country where the infection rate is highest. In Seoul, South Korea, legions of workers in protective suits and goggles have been spraying down subway stations with disinfectant. At some train stations, officials have also been using heat-detecting cameras to look for people who might have a fever. Spokesmen for the Washington, DC, Metro and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, serving Philadelphia and its suburbs, said ridership levels didn't appear to have been affected yet by virus-related concerns. Uncertainty remains about what level of contact could be dangerous. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the droplets are inhaled by someone nearby. It also can be picked up by touching an infected surface or object and then touching the mouth or nose, though the CDC says that isn't the main way the virus can spread."

21,Earthquake rocks Italy amid coronavirus outbreak: Tremor in country's north sends people running into the streetsÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8096163/Earthquake-rocks-Italy-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html,"Italians poured out of their homes in the country's north this afternoon after an earthquake shookTuscany amid the nation's growing coronavirusoutbreak. The 2.6-magnitude quake, which struck around a mile north of Camaiore, was recorded by theItalian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology at2.17pm local time. It had an epicenter in theLucca province in Tuscany and a depth of around five miles, ANSAreported. There were initially no reports of damage as a result of the tremor, though people in Camaiore and nearbyViareggio noted feeling 'vibrations from the ground'. It was also reported people acrossVersilia had 'poured out of their houses' when the quake struck the area this afternoon. The earthquake comes as the coronavirus death toll reached 463 in Italy, with more than 9,000 virus cases confirmed across the stricken nation. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte declared last night that 'everyone must give up something to protect the health of citizens'. Anyone with a fever has been ordered to stay indoors with travel banned except in emergencies and public gatherings including weddings, funerals and sports fixtures shut down. The virus is spreading so quickly that doctors are now having to make life-or-death decisions about who gets access to intensive care. Italian health officials had warned on Saturday that the northern Lombardy region was starting to run out of hospital beds for its intensive care patients. The government also began to recall retired doctors as part of an effort to quickly bolster the health service with 20,000 staff. Ethics rules call on doctors to consider a patient's age and their chance of survival when allocating hospital beds. The Italian society of anesthesiology and intensive care has published 15 ethical recommendations to consider for doctors when deciding on admissions. The criteria include the patient's age and the likelihood of survival, and not just 'first come first served.' 'It's a reasoning that our colleagues make,' Dr. Guido Giustetto, head of the association of doctors in northern Piedmont, said yesterday. 'It becomes dramatic if, rather than doing it under normal situations, they do it because the beds are so scarce that someone might not have access to medical care.' Italy expanded its quarantine measures to all 60million people in the country last night after a lockdown in the hardest-hit north, including Milan and Venice, had failed to slow the outbreak. 'Our habits must be changed, changed now. We all have to give up something for the good of Italy,' prime minister Conte said. 'When I speak of Italy, I speak of our dear ones, of our grandparents and of our parents,' he said. 'We will succeed only if we all collaborate and we adapt right away to these more stringent norms.' Conte also raged at young people who had continued to gather socially as the virus spread, saying 'this night life ... we can't allow this any more.' The nationwide restrictions mean that all schools and universities will remain closed until April 3, with cafes, pubs and eateries ordered to close until dusk. Italians have been ordered not to move around the country except for work and emergencies, with public gatherings and football matches cancelled."
22,"Italian doctors are forced to choose between dying coronavirus patients, as it's revealed over-65s are not even being assessed at 'overwhelmed' hospitals",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095835/Overwhelmed-Italian-hospitals-running-200-cent-capacity.html,"Italian hospitals are so 'overwhelmed' bycoronavirusthat strokes are going untreated and elderly patients are not even being assessed, a doctor at the centre of the crisis has said - while another medic said people should be panicking more. Doctors in Italy have been forced into life-or-death decisions over who should receive intensive care, with virus cases piling up around the country. A medic in northern Italy told a friend in the UK that hospitals were running at '200 per cent capacity' with operating theatres hurriedly converted into intensive care units. Non-coronavirus cases are being sidelined with some medics being given a 'leaflet' and told to perform specialist tasks for which they are not qualified, while some patients over 65 are not even being assessed, the doctor said. In addition, medical staff themselves are becoming 'sick and emotionally overwhelmed' and left 'in tears' because they cannot stop people dying, they said. The medic's comments were published in a Twitter thread by UK-based friend Jason van Schoor, an anaesthetist and clinical fellow at University College London. The doctor also issued a warning for the UK, saying that the Italian chaos would repeat itself in Britain 'if you don't take it seriously'. His warning was echoed by a second doctor who suggested people should be more scared, saying that overzealous warnings to remain calm meant 'the danger of what is happening does not reach people'. Experts have suggested that the UK outbreak is around two weeks behind that in Italy, meaning Britain could be heading for a similar nightmare within a fortnight. 'I feel the pressure to give you a quick personal update about what is happening in Italy, and also give some quick direct advice about what you should do. 'First, Lombardy is the most developed region in Italy and it has extraordinary good healthcare, I have worked in Italy, UK and Australia and don't make the mistake to think that what is happening is happening in a third world country. 'The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all. Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19, they are running 200 per cent capacity. 'We've stopped all routine, all ORs [operating rooms] have been converted to ITUs [intensive treatment units] and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. 'There are hundreds of patients with severe respiratory failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask. 'Patients above 65, or younger with comorbidities, are not even assessed by ITU, I am not saying not tubed, I'm saying not assessed and no ITU staff attends when they arrest. 'Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed. 'My friends call me in tears because they see people dying in front of them and they con only offer some oxygen. Ortho and pathologists are being given a leaflet and sent to see patients on NIV [non-invasive ventilation]. PLEASE STOP, READ THIS AGAIN AND THINK. 'We have seen the same pattern in different areas a week apart, and there is no reason that in a few weeks it won't be the same everywhere, this is the pattern: 1) A few positive cases, first mild measures, people are told to avoid ED [emergency department] but still hang out in groups, everyone says not to panic. 2) Some moderate respiratory failures and a few severe ones that need tube, but regular access to ED is significantly reduced so everything looks great. 3) Tons of patients with moderate respiratory failure, that overtime deteriorate to saturate ICUs [intensive care units] first, then NIVs, then CPAP [continuous positive airway pressure] hoods, then even O2 [oxygen]. 4) Staff gets sick so it gets difficult to cover for shifts, mortality spikes also from all other causes that can't be treated properly. 'Everything about how to treat them is online but the only things that will make a difference are: do not be afraid of massively strict measures to keep people safe. 'If governments won't do this at least keep your family safe, your loved ones with history of cancer or diabetes or any transplant will not be tubed if they need it even if they are young. By safe I mean YOU do not attend them and YOU decide who does and YOU teach them how to. 'Another typical attitude is read and listen to people saying things like this and think 'that's bad dude' and then go out for dinner because you think you'll be safe. 'We have seen it, you won't be if you don't take it seriously. I really hope it won't be as bad as here but prepare.' Mr van Schoor said he was passing on a message from a 'well-respected' friend who worked as an intensive care medic and A&E consultant in northern Italy. 'The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all,' the unnamed medic told Mr van Schoor. 'Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19 [the disease caused by coronavirus], they are running 200 per cent capacity. 'We've stopped all routine, all operating rooms have been converted to intensive care units and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. 'There are hundreds of patients with severe respiratory failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask. 'Patients above 65, or younger with comorbidities, are not even assessed by [intensive care], I am not saying not tubed, I'm saying not assessed.' The medic added: 'Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed. 'My friends call me in tears because they see people dying in front of them and they con only offer some oxygen.' The medic added that Lombardy, the area of northern Italy at the centre of the crisis, was 'the most developed region in Italy and has extraordinary good healthcare'. 'Don't make the mistake to think that what is happening is happening in a third world country,' they said. Offering advice for the UK, the doctor said: 'We have seen the same pattern in different areas a week apart, and there is no reason that in a few weeks it won't be the same everywhere.' Describing the pattern, the medic said it would start with a few cases - as the outbreak did in the UK - before spiralling into a major crisis where intensive care units are 'saturated'. They warned that staff would 'get sick so it gets difficult to cover for shifts' while mortality would 'spike from all other causes that can't be treated properly'. 'We have seen it, you won't be [safe] if you don't take it seriously. I really hope it won't be as bad as here but prepare,' the doctor said. Experts have warned that the UK is following the same trajectory as Italy, and could end up in a similar situation within two weeks. University College London biology professor Dr Francis Balloux said: 'The trajectory of the epidemic in the UK is so far roughly comparable to the one in Northern Italy, but with the epidemic in Northern Italy two to three weeks ahead of the situation in the UK.' Dr Balloux said that it was possible the UK could face a similar lockdown to the one which has brought Italy to its knees. Adam Kay, the bestselling British author and former doctor, warned in a tweet about the crisis in Italy: 'This is us in a fortnight'. Italy has suffered the worst outbreak in Europe and one of the heaviest outside China, with more than 9,000 cases confirmed and 463 dead. Northern Italy has been worst affected, but the government's drastic quarantine measures have now been extended to the entire country. The UK currently has 321 confirmed cases, with five deaths. Another Italian medic warned that the public may be underestimating the 'epidemiological disaster' because of warnings not to panic. Daniele Macchini said he 'understands the need not to panic' but said he 'shuddered' because the 'message of the danger of what is happening does not reach people'. 'The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night,' Daniele Macchini said in a lengthy Facebook post. 'Cases are multiplying, we arrive at a rate of 15-20 hospitalisations per day all for the same reason. 'The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the emergency room is collapsing.' The surgeon inBergamo in northern Italy said that doctors on the front line were 'part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us'. He also urged people to abide by Italy's stringent new quarantine measures. 'So be patient too, you can't go to the theater, museums or gym. Try to have mercy on that myriad of older people you could exterminate,' he said. 'It is not your fault, I know, but of those who put it in your head that you are exaggerating - and even this testimony may seem just an exaggeration for those who are far from the epidemic, but please, listen to us - try to leave the house only to indispensable things. 'Do not go en masse to stock up in supermarkets: it is the worst thing because you concentrate and the risk of contacts with infected people who do not know they are higher. You can go there as you usually do.' Despite his warning, many Italians have done exactly that today with long queues forming outside supermarkets. The virus is spreading so fast in Italy that doctors are making comparisons to wartime triage medics deciding who lives, who dies and who gets access to intensive care. The Italian society of anesthesiology and intensive care has published 15 ethical recommendations to consider when deciding on intensive care admissions. The criteria include the age of the patient and the probability of survival, and not just 'first come first served.' 'It's a reasoning that our colleagues make,' said Dr Guido Giustetto, head of the association of doctors in northern Piedmont. 'It becomes dramatic if, rather than doing it under normal situations, they do it because the beds are so scarce that someone might not have access to medical care.' One doctor in Lombardy,Christian Salaroli, told Il Corriere della Sera: 'If a person between 80 and 95 years old has severe respiratory failure, it's likely we will not go ahead. 'If they have multi-organ failure, with more than two or three vital organs, it means that their mortality rate is 100 per cent.' The Lombardy government has been scrambling to increase its capacity, converting operating and recovery rooms into isolated wards. It has cobbled together 150 more beds in the last two weeks and expects another 150 in the coming week. 'Unfortunately we're only at the beginning,' said Dr Massimo Galli, head of infectious disease at Milan's Sacco hospital. Speaking to SkyTg24, Galli noted that the numbers of infections registered in Lombardy last week were similar to those in Wuhan, China in late January."
23,"This market crash might be comparable in severity to the one seen during the global financial crisis but it's very different under the bonnet, says ALEX SEBASTIAN",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-8095329/This-market-crash-similar-size-2008-different-bonnet.html,"The market slump seen over recent weeks is of similar magnitude to the one seen during the global financial crisis of 2008 with more than a fifth of value knocked off shares, but the reasons are very different. What causes a crash is as important as the fact that the market crashed, if not more so, because it gives us clues about what may lie ahead. In 2008 the crisis peaked with the September collapse of US investment bank, Lehman Brothers. Events had been building to this crescendo for over a year beforehand, with other lenders going bust such as Bear Stearns and Northern Rock here in Britain. What brought all these institutions down, and subsequently caused a stock market crash and recession was a fundamental problem in the world's financial system. Namely, that banks had become massively over-leveraged, with their books almost entirely consisting of borrowing and lending, with very little cash actually being held for a rainy day. As they all became more aware of this and the risks it implied they stopped lending to each other and to businesses, threatening how the whole world works, economically speaking. The current crisis, at this stage at least, has been sparked by very different things. It is largely a sentiment driven crisis, caused by fear generated by a so-called 'black swan' event â€“ the novel coronavirus outbreak and its impact on economic activity, as well as the fallout between Russia and Saudi Arabia over oil production levels. Given that - at this stage - the reasons for the share price crash are not as fundamental and don't threaten the working of the banking system as in 2008, why have the falls been of similar size? It is partly a consequence of markets being pushed so high for so long by central banks' low interest rates and money printing. The 'bigger they are, the harder they fall' principle applies here. For many months, perhaps a couple of years, markets have been itching for a big sell-off. Widespread stock market corrections are inevitable and it's a matter of when not if, so investors are always on the lookout for a reason to sell. Many have been ready with their fingers on the button, waiting for a reason to push it. The virus outbreak gave them that reason. One other factor behind the magnitude of the falls often mooted is the prevalence of automated algorithmic trading, which many believe can exacerbate sell-offs in a way that was not the case in 2008. A descent into a much more serious crisis can never be ruled out, but these differences mean there is room for optimism that the slowdown caused by the virus can be managed, even if it gets as far as recession territory. Aside from the inevitable handful of doom-mongers, few people see the outbreak as a threat to the world's financial system at this stage. Something to be wary of is that big investors who have shorted the market will try and spread fear to push it further down, and profit from that. Largely as a consequence of the 2008 crisis, lenders have been forced to hold a lot more cash in reserve to cope with economic slowdowns, so big banks going bust if we do see a recession is far less likely. Nobody knows for sure how the Covid-19 outbreak will play out in the weeks and months ahead, but data suggest China has put the brakes on the outbreak and infection numbers have started to fall there. It's not just the official government numbers of infections that are improving, there are indications of people returning to work and economic activity resuming. If the origin and worst hit country can bring the crisis to heel, other parts of the world should be able to as well in time. Central banks learnt some big lessons from 2008 as well, and stand ready to act to support the world economy. While they don't have much room to cut rates, they always have the option of quantitative easing. Fiscal stimulus â€“ cutting taxes or increasing public spending â€“ is available to governments and we can expect to see this put into action tomorrow in the Budget. An economic slowdown or recession has far reaching consequences for prosperity and peoples' jobs of course, but the entire financial system is not in peril, as it was in 2008."

Timothy Delgado, 43, was an assistant US attorney for the Eastern District of California. He shot his 45-year-old wife, Tamara Delgado, in a murder-suicide in Granite Bay, according to a Placer County Sheriff's Office statement. The US Attorney's Office in Sacramento said Monday it is cooperating with the investigation and referred questions to the sheriff's office. Delgado appears to have prosecuted narcotics and firearms cases, a search of the office's website shows, KCRA reported. Tamara Delgado's mother called the sheriff's office to check on the couple, bringing deputies to their home in the 9800 block of Wesbourne Way, according to spokeswoman Angela Musallam. Her Facebook page indicates that Tamara Delgado, nee Zars, married the federal prosecutor in November 2019. The woman appears to have a grown daughter who lives in Texas and a young son from a past relationship. It is unclear where the boy was at the time of the murder-suicide. Her last photo shows Tamara as a bride dressed in white on her wedding day on November 7, posing happily with her new husband and two children.

25,Eat to beat diabetes: In Part 2 of our guide on how to reverse type 2 disease NHS expert DR DAVID UNWIN and chef KATIE CALDESI bring you the comfort food you can scoff and still be low carbÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-8093801/DR-DAVID-UNWIN-chef-KATIE-CALDESI-bring-comfort-food-scoff-low-carb.html,"Today,in the third part of our life-changing series, NHS GP Dr David Unwin reveals how going low-carb has helped type 2 diabetes patients reduce their medication doses â€” or even come off it completely â€” and why it is not just those with diabetes that can benefit. Meanwhile, chef and food writer Katie Caldesi offers her delicious take on some true family favourites. Reading through the delicious recipes published in this series, you might find it hard to think of this food as â€˜medicineâ€™. But in a sense, that is what it is â€” and increasingly, the medical profession is starting to pay attention. Certainly, until I came across the low-carb approach in 2012, I had no idea how powerful things like diet and exercise could be. The pressure of ten-minute GP appointments gave me very little time to explore lifestyle approaches as treatments for high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Also I didnâ€™t think my patients were interested, and would prefer to take medication. But I never asked them! Thatâ€™s now changed and for the past seven years, before I start any patient on potentially lifelong medication for high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes, I will ask them if they would prefer to try lifestyle changes such as a low-carb diet, first. And 99 per cent of these patients have told me that they prefer to avoid medication. I think this comes partly from concern about side-effects and partly because taking drugs can make people feel older and less in control of their health. Of course, there is no question that medicines have made a great contribution to the health of the country. Lives have been saved and illness avoided; who can argue against antibiotics for pneumonia or insulin for type 1 diabetes? However, against these successes are the side-effects of many drugs. I have come across increasing numbers of patients suffering side-effects from medications, particularly older people who may be more vulnerable to this as their livers and kidneys â€” our â€˜detoxifyingâ€™ organs â€” donâ€™t work as efficiently. Astonishingly, adverse effects of medicines account for 6.5 per cent of all hospital admissions, with rates of over 10 and up to 20 per cent seen in the over-65s, according to figures in The BMJ (British Medical Journal). This is particularly important if people are taking medication that offers no benefit or is no longer needed. I started noticing this one hot summer when I called out three ambulances in one week for older people who had collapsed because of low blood pressure caused by medication they no longer needed. I am not for a moment suggesting people should unilaterally stop taking what could be essential medicine, but this shows how important it is to turn up for your annual medication review appointments, where it is quite reasonable to ask â€˜Do I need all these medications?â€™. Itâ€™s a growing concern as more of us end up on more and more pills, as shown by a 2017 study in the journal Age And Ageing, which looked into the medication usage of older people. It found there had been a dramatic increase over the past two decades, with a quadrupling in the number of people taking five or more medicines (from 12 per cent to 49 per cent); meanwhile, the number of people taking no medicines has reduced from one in five to one in 13. Polypharmacy â€” being on five or more medications â€” occurs with increasing frequency, too. And more often than I like to think about, some of the medications I have prescribed to people have been to treat side-effects of their other medications. For example, I would often prescribe an overweight person with knee or back pain anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, but so often this leads to indigestion, for which I would also prescribe omeprazole (a drug that reduces stomach acid) â€” without first finding out if the patient had thought about the alternative of weight loss. Lifestyle can offer a viable alternative to medication in conditions such as type 2 diabetes. The drug metformin is the most common treatment for type 2. Itâ€™s a good drug but 10 to 20 per cent of those taking it experience side-effects such as bloating or loose motions (for which I would sometimes prescribe loperamide). And is this treatment really addressing the cause of the illness? Metformin is more of a â€˜sticking plasterâ€™ which does help certainly, but it is not a cure. Contrast this with diet and exercise which can result in the remission of type 2 diabetes, meaning patients no longer needed their medication â€” a study in The Lancet in 2018 showed that diet and weight loss could have this outcome in nearly 50 per cent of cases. A very hopeful statistic, though more research is needed to see if it lasts. In my own practice, 46 per cent of type 2 diabetes patients whoâ€™ve tried low-carb have been able to come off their diabetes medication. While running my low-carb clinic I stumbled on something similar with high blood pressure in people with type 2. On giving up sugar, bread and potatoes their blood pressure improved so much I could stop more than 20 per cent of their medication for hypertension â€” as documented in a study I published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Q: Are glucose and sugar the same thing? A. Glucose is one of many types of sugar. Others are fructose, lactose, dextrose or maltose. This makes the reading of lists of ingredients tricky as sugar sneaks in under so many different guises. When we talk of â€˜blood sugarâ€™ we really mean glucose. By â€˜sugarâ€™ many of us mean the white crystals we spoon into our tea â€“ this is table sugar or more properly â€˜sucroseâ€™, an equal mixture of two sugars: fructose and glucose. The research paper, which was written with the help of two senior cardiologists, looked at 154 patients whoâ€™d been on regular prescriptions for their high blood pressure. But thanks to going low-carb, around a fifth (21 per cent) of the prescriptions were stopped. This is very unusual â€” people are normally on these medications for life. As well as improvements in blood pressure, we documented significant improvements in cholesterol. Itâ€™s important to point out that no single diet will suit all and there are other ways to tackle type 2 diabetes â€” for instance, the 800-calories-a-day approach, developed by Professor Roy Taylor at Newcastle University, and types of gastric surgery used to help those who are morbidly obese, have both produced good results. But diet and lifestyle changes also offer a real alternative to a potential lifetime on drugs, and puts patients back in control. And as the GPs who featured in last Saturdayâ€™s Mail revealed, this can also give doctors themselves a great sense of satisfaction in having made a difference where other approaches have failed. Thatâ€™s a win all-round in my book. This recipe replaces starchy potato with celeriac or swede to lower the carbs. It is ideal for using up leftover vegetables and makes a hearty lunch on a cold day. Serves 4 Per serving: Carbs, 4.9g Protein, 22g Fat, 33g Fibre, 4.2g Calories, 409 Roughly blitz the cooked vegetables in a food processor. Heat the grill to hot. Fry the onion in half the butter and half the oil with seasoning in a large frying pan over a medium heat until soft. Spoon the onions into a mixing bowl, keep the pan to one side. Mix the blitzed vegetables with the onions and cheese. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Heat the remaining butter and oil in the frying pan until bubbling. Spoon the mixture back into the pan and cook for 10 minutes, or until the underside is browned. Shake the pan to make sure it is not sticking. Transfer the pan to the grill and cook on a high shelf until golden brown. Meanwhile poach the eggs. Be careful of the handle of the pan and either turn the bubble and squeak out or serve it straight from the pan. Serve with the poached eggs on top. Only florets of cauliflower are used in this recipe, any remaining leaves can be steamed or boiled and buttered with plenty of black pepper and served with the dish. Serves 6 Per serving: Carbs, 8.8g Protein, 27g Fat, 24g Fibre, 2.6g Calories, 361 Steam, boil or microwave the cauliflower florets for about six minutes, or until soft when pierced with a knife. Use a brush to generously butter an ovenproof dish roughly 22cm in diameter, leaving brushstrokes vertically on the sides of the dish. This will help the soufflÃ© to rise. When cooked, drain the cauliflower and put into the bottom of the buttered dish. Season with salt and plenty of black pepper and dot over the remaining butter. Set aside. Heat the oven to 180c/160 fan/ gas 4. Mix the ricotta, Parmesan, mustard, nutmeg, seasoning and egg yolks together in a mixing bowl. (If using an electric beater, mix the egg white first before combining them with the egg yolk mixture). Whisk the egg whites to firm peaks using an electric mixer or a balloon whisk. Using a large metal spoon, fold the egg whites into the cheese mixture being as gentle as you can, so as not to lose any air. Spoon the soufflÃ© mix over the top of the cauliflower florets. Scatter over the remaining cheese and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until risen and rich golden brown. Asa child this was one of my favourite home-cooked dishes. I loved to watch the batter rise in the oven and wrap the sausages in a puffy duvet of savoury batter. Do seek out sausages made with a high-meat content and very little rusk or maize as the carbs will be lower. Serves 4 Per serving: Carbs, 16g Protein, 32g Fat, 47g Fibre, 2.7g Calories, 627 For the batter For the sausage and leeks Make the batter by beating the ingredients together with a whisk in a mixing bowl or whizz them briefly in a food processor. Leave the batter to rest while you cook the sausages. Heat the oven to 220c/fan 200c/ gas 6. Put the sausages, leeks and fat into an ovenproof dish measuring approximately 20cm x 30cm and bake for 20 minutes. Turn a couple of times during cooking to ensure the leeks are coated in the fat. Remove from the oven and pour in the batter straight away, it should sizzle as it goes in. Scatter over the thyme sprigs. Put the tray back into the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until it is well risen, firm to the touch and golden brown. Remove the tray from the oven, and leave it to cool for a few minutes before serving. This family favourite can be put back on the menu with our low-carb pastry. Freeze or use the spare egg white in scrambled egg or an omelette the following day. Serves 8 Per serving: Carbs, 16g Protein, 38g Fat, 43g Fibre, 5.8g Calories, 614 For the pastry For the filling Use a food processor to blend the butter with the almonds and coconut flour or use your hands and a bowl. Make sure it is well combined and there are no lumps. Add the egg and mix it in. Scrape the pastry into a ball and lay it in the centre of a piece of baking parchment, flatten lightly and wrap it up. Rest in the fridge while you make the filling. Fry the chicken in the fat in a large frying pan, scattered with a little salt, over a medium-to-high heat until browned all over. Remove the pan from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to the pie dish and set aside. Turn the heat down to medium and fry the leeks in the remaining fat in the pan with a splash of water, covered, until soft, turning occasionally. Remove the lid and add the bay leaves, nutmeg, salt, pepper and scatter over the cornflour. Cook for a minute while stirring through then add the milk. Bring to the boil, stirring continuously until the sauce has thickened. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Remove the bay leaves and pour the sauce over the chicken, stir through and set aside. Leave to cool for 15 minutes. Heat the oven to 190c/170c fan/gas 5. Remove the pastry from the fridge. Lay it on the piece of baking parchment and put another piece over the top. Roll the pastry out so that it is about 4mm thick and large enough to cover your pie dish. You can check the size by holding the pastry between the sheets of baking parchment over the dish. Peel off the top sheet of paper and then turn the pastry onto the pie, removing the second piece of paper. Donâ€™t worry if the pastry cracks. Trim off the excess and use a fork to seal the edges. Brush the top of the pastry with beaten egg yolk and make a hole in the centre to let the steam out of the pie as it cooks. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve with green vegetables. Normal fish fingers can have up to 40g carbs a serving. By making fish fingers yourself you will have some odd-shaped pieces, but the health benefits and flavour will more than make up for it. Serves 6 Per serving: Carbs, 7.7g Protein, 32g Fat, 18g Fibre, 6.8g Calories, 329 Heat the oven to 180c/160c fan/gas 4. Make the breadcrumbs from the Country-Style Loaf by whizzing in a food processor. Pour them on to a plate and spread out. Break the egg into a shallow bowl and beat with a fork. Cut the fish fillets into pieces, approximately the width and length of two fingers. Season the fish lightly with salt and dip into the beaten egg, followed by the breadcrumbs. If there are any bare patches on the fish, dip them back into the egg and crumbs. Lay the fish on a baking tray and put into the oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until cooked through. Remove from the oven as soon as the fish feels firm to the touch. Serve with celeriac chips, salad, tartare sauce or mayo and a wedge of lemon â€” or make into a sandwich with a couple of slices of the Country-Style Loaf. This hearty Scottish soup warms the soul in winter. We have replaced the potato with celeriac, which thickens and adds flavour but halves the carbs. Serves 4 Per serving: Carbs, 12g Protein, 31g Fat, 19g Fibre, 5g Calories, 353 Heat the milk, the bay leaf and a small pinch of salt and a good twist of pepper in a shallow pan with a lid with over a medium to high heat until hot. Add the fish to the pan and cook, covered, until it is firm to the touch and just cooked through. This should take about five minutes, depending on the size of the pieces. Remove from the heat and set aside. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a low-to-medium heat, and add the leek, onion, black pepper and a pinch of salt. Cover and allow to sweat for about 10 minutes, or until softened. Stir occasionally, making sure it doesnâ€™t colour. Add the celeriac to the pan with the onions and stir through. Pour the milk from cooking the fish through a sieve into the pan with the celeriac and bring to the boil. Add the bay leaf to the pan but keep the fish on one side. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook the celeriac until soft when pierced with a knife. Meanwhile, remove the skin and any bones from the haddock and gently break into bite-sized pieces. Set aside. Remove the bay leaf from the pan and blend the soup with a stick blender until smooth. Heat the soup until piping hot and stir in the cream, followed by the fish, and gently combine. If the soup is very thick, add a little hot water to dilute it to a looser consistency. Adjust the seasoning to taste and serve with a swirl of cream and chives. Use up any spare celeriac or swede in a low-carb mash. Cook the whole dish in a casserole or improvise by using a round, ovenproof serving dish and a pan lid. Serves 6 Per serving: Carbs, 14g Protein, 29g Fat, 47g Fibre, 4.3g Calories, 602 Heat two tablespoons of the fat and fry the lamb over a high heat in a casserole dish. Season the meat with pepper and salt in the pan, add the bay leaf and thyme and stir occasionally until any water has evaporated and the meat is browned all over. Heat the oven to 190c/170c fan/gas 5. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions and turnips to the pan, stir through and cook the onions for about 10 minutes, or until they are soft. Discard the sprigs of thyme but leave the bay leaves. Scatter the cornflour over the top and stir in, then add the Worcestershire sauce and stock. Bring to the boil, stirring constantly. You should have a rich and tasty soup-like gravy. Arrange the celeriac slices like overlapping scales over the lamb, pressing them down to touch the gravy. Use a brush to dab the tops with the remaining tablespoon of fat. Put the lid on the casserole, if you have one, or wrap the dish tightly in two layers of foil. Bake the hotpot in the oven for 90 minutes, then remove the lid or foil and cook until the celeriac is golden brown and tender. By Dr David Unwin When I started offering the low-carb diet to my patients, it was specifically to tackle type 2 diabetes. But I found it improved other conditions, too. Last Saturday in the Mail, one of my patients, Marcia Mawdsley, whoâ€™d had type 2 for 23 years, revealed how after going low-carb she had lost more than 3 st and had been able to come off insulin and blood pressure medication, too. Meanwhile, Anna Eastwood, who told her story last Tuesday, reversed her fatty liver disease after shedding almost 9 st on a low-carb diet. Other patients have also seen their cholesterol levels improve, so they no longer need to take statins. And some report finally sleeping better. But what links these conditions to type 2 diabetes â€” and giving up sugar and starchy carbs? Firstly, a word about non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition thatâ€™s now reached epidemic proportions â€” as many as one in three people is estimated to have early signs of it, according to the NHS. Often it shows up on ultrasound scans of the liver that show it to be enlarged and full of fat. These conditions â€” type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, central obesity (carrying excess weight around the abdomen), fatty liver disease, as well as raised blood fats levels such as triglyceride are often found together and make up something we call the metabolic syndrome, which is itself linked to heart disease and some cancers. What connects all these conditions is our old friend, insulin. The hormone insulin is produced by your pancreas to get your blood sugar down. It does this by pushing glucose out of the bloodstream and into cells. Firstly, it pushes glucose into the muscle cells for energy, but if you eat more sugar than your muscles need then the excess is pushed into your belly fat and liver in a form of fat called triglyceride. This may give rise to central obesity and fatty liver. In its turn, fatty liver causes your cells to become more resistant to insulin, so it doesnâ€™t work as well â€” we call this insulin resistance and it is part of how we develop type 2 diabetes. This helps explain why all these conditions are found together. But what about high blood pressure? This was the subject of a paper I published last year with Professor Adrian Brady, a cardiologist from the University of Glasgow â€” we found that people with type 2 diabetes choosing a low-carb diet achieved significant improvements in blood pressure. It seems that for people with type 2, insulin causes them to hoard salt, which raises blood pressure. Finally, with the sleeping problems, itâ€™s the losing weight that probably plays a role in the improvements my patients report. Perhaps some of you saw the recent news story about â€˜fatty tonguesâ€™ being the main driver of sleep apnoea? This condition, often associated with heavy snoring, causes people to stop breathing for a while and is associated with daytime sleepiness and high blood pressure, which affect quality of life. The â€˜fatty tongueâ€™ bit made me start asking my low-carb patients if any of them had noticed any improvement in this, as one might expect weight loss to help. One man (or rather, his wife) noticed a significant improvement in just three weeks. Our weight loss star Anna Eastwood was on the waiting list for a sleep clinic appointment she now no longer needs! While brushing your teeth twice a day is essential for good oral health, many people donâ€™t realise that this alone wonâ€™t stop tooth decay, which is preventable and is all down to diet. Tooth decay occurs when the acids produced by bacteria in your mouth when digesting starchy and sugary foods dissolve the structure of the tooth. The more often you eat sugar, the quicker the damage occurs to your teeth. The easiest way to avoid tooth decay is to stop feeding bacteria the food they love best â€” sugar. But itâ€™s not just sugar itself: other carbs such as bread can be broken down into sugar in minutes. Another problem is gum disease, which is worse in type 2 patients and is an inflammation of the tissues that hold your teeth in place, resulting in bleeding and swelling â€” and eventually, tooth loss. If your gums bleed when you brush your teeth, this is a sign of gum disease and you should see your dentist or hygienist promptly. Gum disease is caused by an inflammatory response by the body to bacteria on teeth. There are a number of studies that suggest eating a diet thatâ€™s low in carbs and sugar may encourage your immune system to function optimally, reducing inflammation in the body as a whole. This in turn, means your gums are likelier to stay healthy. The solution is in your hands! bowlanedental.com James Goolnik Clinical director of Bow Lane Dental Group Note:Stopping prescribed medication is potentially dangerous. If you have concerns about your medication please see your GP. If you are on medication for diabetes see your GP before you change your diet as changes in medication may be needed.

26,Vladimir Putin would be allowed to run for president again under constitutional amendment backed by Russia's ruling partyÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095597/Vladimir-Putin-allowed-run-president-constitutional-amendment.html,"Russian President Vladimir Putin today laid out a path to staying in power beyond 2024, as politicians approved sweeping reforms to the constitution. In a surprise address to the lower house State Duma, Putin said there could be a presidential 'reset' allowing him to run after his current term expires. 'This would be possible... if the constitutional court rules such an amendment would not go against (the constitution),' he said. Putin appeared before the Duma after lawmakers proposed a series of amendments to a package of constitutional reforms he announced in January. Among them was an amendment put forward by Valentina Tereshkova, an MP and Soviet-era cosmonaut who was the first woman in space, that would annul previous presidential terms. This would allow 67-year-old Putin, who was first elected in 2000, to run again after his current six-year term expires, and potentially stay in power until 2036. 'These amendments are long overdue, they are needed, and I am sure they will be useful for society, for our citizens,' he told lawmakers. He said Russia needed evolutionary change, 'because we have had enough of revolutions' while suggesting that the country may not yet be ready for a new leader. 'There will be a time when the highest power... will not be tied to one specific person. But all of our previous history happened in this way, and of course we cannot ignore this,' Putin said. Lawmakers also proposed holding early parliamentary elections but Putin said that was not necessary and the amendment was withdrawn. He also rejected a call for a lifting of the overall two-term presidential limit. Deputies then voted to approve the reforms in the key second reading, with 382 in favour, 44 abstentions and none against. A third and final reading is due in the Duma on Wednesday, followed by approval in the upper house Federation Council and a public vote on the reforms planned for April 22. Putin shocked Russia's political establishment by announcing the package of reforms in January, the first major changes to the country's basic law since 1993. The political changes will also give parliament the power to choose the government and increase the role of the State Council, an advisory body. Other proposals aim at boosting living standards, including a guaranteed minimum wage and state pensions adjusted to inflation. And - in line with Putin's strongly conservative views - the reforms would enshrine a mention of Russians' 'faith in God' and spell out that marriage is a heterosexual union. Russia's opposition, including Putin's most prominent critic Alexei Navalny, has denounced the proposals as an effort to make him 'president for life'. 'Interesting how things turn out,' Navalny said in a tweet after Putin's speech. 'Putin has been in power for 20 years but he's going to run for the first time.' More than 20,000 protesters took part in a rally on February 29 calling on Putin not to hold on to power and opposition groups on Tuesday quickly put in requests for permission for more demonstrations. But so far there has not been an upswell of opposition to the reforms, with polls showing many Russian are confused about what the constitutional proposals entail. Observers had previously suggested that Putin could be looking to stay on in a behind-the-scenes role after 2024 as head of another state body. But Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Tuesday's events made it clear Putin wanted to remain in charge. 'It looks that after playing with ideas of State Council and Security Council Putin has finally decided in favour of running again in 2024,' Trenin said on Twitter. Putin was re-elected to a fifth term in 2018 but his approval ratings have been falling as Russia's economy struggles under the weight of Western sanctions and living standards fall. The economy is set for more turbulence in the coming weeks and potentially months after oil prices crashed following the collapse of the production limits deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia. The value of the ruble and Russian stock exchanges have since tumbled. But in presenting the amendment that would annul previous presidential terms, cosmonaut-turned-politician Tereshkova said the possibility of Putin staying on would be reassuring. 'The very existence of such an opportunity for the incumbent president - given his great authority - is a stabilising factor for our society,' she said. "
27,Elon Musk fears he will die before he makes it to Mars because Space X is not progressing quickly enough,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8096279/Elon-Musk-fears-die-makes-Mars-SpaceXs-lack-progress.html,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has long dreamed of landing on Mars, but the billionaire has admitted that the feat may not be accomplished before he dies. Speaking at the Satellite 2020 conference in Washington on Monday, Musk explained that the firm is not progressing as planned and noted it has taken '18 years just to get ready to do the first people in orbit.' 'We've got to improve our rate of innovation or, based on past trends, I am definitely going to be dead before Mars,' Musk said during the discussion. The lack of progress seems to have taken a toll on Musk, who previously said there is a 70 percent chance he will personally take a trip to the Red Planet. Scroll down for videos Musk has shared his plans of colonizing Mars with the public for years. This past January he was aiming to put a million people on the Red Planet by 2050. He planned for three flights a day - or 1,000 flights a year - with 100 people on each one. And in 2017, the tech tycoon had the idea to send two cargo ships to Mars in 2022, followed by four other vessels - two with cargo and two with human settlers in 2024. However, the latest interview revealed that the lack of progress is starting to weigh on Musk. 'If we don't improve our pace of progress, I'm definitely going to be dead before we go to Mars,' Musk said at the conference. 'If it's taken us 18 years just to get ready to do the first people to orbit, we've got to improve our rate of innovation or, based on past trends, I am definitely going to be dead before Mars.' He added: 'Unless we improve our rate of innovation dramatically, then there is no chance of a base on the moon or a city on Mars. This is my biggest concern.' SpaceX, which was founded in 2002, has had its fair shares of bumps in the road when it comes to launching its rockets according to Bloomberg. On September 1, 2016, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket suffered a catastrophic explosion on the Cape Canaveral launch pad during a routine pre-launch check. The blast, which shook buildings and windows miles away, occurred shortly after 9am and destroyed Facebook's $200million Amos-6 satellite that was set to launch on Saturday morning aboard the reusable rocket. Just last month another the prototype of SpaceX's next-generation Starship rocket failed to contain liquid nitrogen during its latest phase of testing. The rocket exploded, sending the stainless steel cylinder flying off its stand and crashing. And there were about a handful of other missteps in between. SpaceX is set to carry out its first manned mission as soon as this spring, which will bring astronauts to the International Space Station.  Musk's latest concerns come just days after he revealed his new plan to colonize the Red Plant. He said he plans to build a new Starship rocket every 72 hours until they have a fleet of 1,000 ships. Musk noted during the visit that each ship would be reusable and have a capacity of more than 90,000 pounds. SpaceX has also added an additional 225 people to its staff at the South Texas Launch Site in order to construct the factory that will churn out the rockets â€“ bringing its staffing total more than 500. Eric Berger withArs Technicaspent the day at the South Texas site to sit in on an all-hand meeting with the CEO himself where he learned of SpaceX's latest Mars mission plan. 'He wanted to know why the Starship factory wasn't humming at all hours,' Berger wrote. 'Why steel sheets weren't getting welded into domes and fuel tanks, why tanks were not being stacked into rockets, why things weren't going as fast as he wanted.' In the meeting Musk told his crew: 'I think we need, probably, on the order of 1,000 ships, and each of those ships would have more payload than the Saturn Vâ€”and be reusable.' The Saturn V was the rocket that took the Apollo missions to the moon and the most powerful during its time â€“ it was designed with a capacity for 90,000 pounds. Musk continued to explain that in order to live on more than one planet, all of the settlements must be stable and sustainable -this is because ships carrying supplies will be delayed at times and these new homes will need to survive. Elon Musk recently unveiled his most ambitious project yet - an 'Interplanetary Transport System' to take mankind to Mars in 80 days and build a sustainable human colony of a million people there. 'What I want to achieve is make Mars seem possible, to show that we can do it in our lifetimes, and you could go,' he said at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico. However, he warned the trip was likely to be dangerous - and said candidates for the first missions 'must be prepared to die'. The Interplanetary Transport System will use a giant rocket booster with a 39 foot (12m) diameter and 49 engines, and a special shuttle with a 56 foot (17m) diameter, making the entire rocket stack 400 feet (122m) high. They will launch with empty fuel tanks and refuel in orbit. Once on Mars, they would make more methane fuel for the return journey. "
28,"Ancient human settlement was obliterated by a COMET that exploded in Earth's atmosphere and sent fragments of molten glass 'hot enough to melt cars' flying to the ground 12,800 years agoÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8095923/Ancient-human-settlement-obliterated-COMET-exploding-Earths-atmosphere-12-800-years-ago.html,"An ancient human settlement was obliterated by a comet that exploded in Earth's atmosphere around12,800 years ago, a study has found. The event destroyed a village found in theAbu Hureyra dig site in Syria and splattered fragments of molten glass 'hot enough to melt cars' to the ground. The impact is also believed to have contributed to the extinction of many large animals, including mammoths as well as North American horses and camels. Experts believe the explosion helped bring about the demise of the North American Clovis culture and usher in an episode of climatic cooling. The glass splatter found at Abu Hureya was found among the remains of bones, building material and plants from when the first nomads settled to cultivate crops. 'Our new discoveries represent much more powerful evidence for very high temperatures that could only be associated with a cosmic impact,' said paper author and geologist James Kennett of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Scroll down for video The Abu Hureyra site is located on the edge of a vast region known as the Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) strewnfield, which incorporates around 30 sites across Europe, the Americas and parts of the Middle East. The strewnfield is characterised by signs of massive-scale burning â€” including a 'black mat' layer that is rich in carbon and platinum and and contains millions of tiny nanodiamonds and tiny metal spheres that must have formed in great heat. Experts had long wondered if this layer of devastation may have been caused by a catastrophic impact event â€” a hypothesis supported by the discovery of a contemporaneous impact crater under theHiawatha Glacier in Greenland.   In their study, Professor Kennett and colleagues analysed the glass found atAbu Hureyra to determine its composition, structure and likely formation temperature â€” concluding thatit formed at temperatures in excess of 3,992Â°F (2,200Â°C). 'To help with perspective, such high temperatures would completely melt an automobile in less than a minute,' said Professor Kennett. 'The Abu Hureyra village would have been abruptly destroyed,' he added. Such intense heats could not be explained by contemporary human technology â€” or even lightningor a volcanic eruption. Instead, the researchers said, such must haveresulted from an extremely violent, high-energy and high-velocity phenomenon â€” like a cosmic impact. This conclusion is supported by the presence in the meltglass ofminerals rich in chromium, iron, nickel, sulphides, titanium and even platinum and iridium-rich iron. 'The critical materials are extremely rare under normal temperatures, but are commonly found during impact events,' Professor Kennett explained. The team found that the meltglass recovered from the Abu Hureyra site contained both material from the comet, but also vaporised soil, sediments and organic matter from the settlement that cooled nearly instantaneously to form glass. The researchers also found that the glass in the Syrian site chemically matched materials found from across the YDBstrewnfield, suggesting that such came from the explosion â€” or 'air burst' â€” of a single comet in the atmosphere. 'A single major asteroid impact would not have caused such widely scattered materials like those discovered at Abu Hureyra,' Professor Kennett explained. 'The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of air bursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth. 'The YDB [impact] hypothesis proposed this mechanism to account for the widely dispersed [contemporary] materials across more than 14,000 kilometres of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 'Our Abu Hureyra discoveries strongly support a major impact event from such a fragmented comet.' According to Professor Kennett, the air burst must have occurred close enough to the village to send heat and molten glass across the entirety of the settlement. Experts had previously found evidence of meltglass deposits at another dig site â€”Pilauco, in southern Chile â€” however here only indirect evidence of human settlement, like the butchering of large animals, had been unearthed. The full findings of the study were published in the journal Scientific Reports. An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what astronomers call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets. For example, if Earth passes through the tail of a comet, much of the debris burns up in the atmosphere, forming a meteor shower."
29,"Husband and wife who live with his parents AND his grandmother see their bungalow transformed thanks to a $100,000 renovation by The Property Brothers",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8092543/Property-Brothers-transform-newlyweds-house-dream-home.html,"A husband and wife who live with his parents and grandmother were delighted when their cramped bungalow was transformed into a spacious family home in a $100,000 renovation. Newlyweds Nora and Diego, from Richmond, California, enlisted the help of property gurus Jonathan and Drew Scott in last night's episode of Property Brothers: Forever Homes. The couple explained they loved the location of their single-storey home but needed to create more space as they wanted to start a family of their own soon. Jonathan and Drew were able to come up with a plan to create a sense of space within the property, without breaking the $100,000 budget, leaving Nora and Diego delighted. Explaining their needs, Nora said: 'We all cook a lot together and it's kind of a tight space. Diegoâ€™s parents and grandmother live with us and we all really like spending time together.' He added: 'Peruvian families are big and love to come in and cook, there's usually one person cooking and one person cutting and it's pretty ugly.' Despite the cramped space, Nora andDiego wanted to stay in their Richmond home as they loved the community spirit, but admitted that the house needed 'a lot of work' before they'd be able to start a family. Speaking of the home, Nora said: 'We love the location, it's near our favourite hiking area, it's usually sunny.' Diego interjected: 'There's a lot of Peruvian families that live in the neighbourhood.' Nora went on: 'It's a very big house, we see that we can grow here. We want to have kids soon, we can see that coming together. 'It has a really nice central vibe, we really like that. It has a lot of potential but we know it needs a lot of work.' The couple explained that while Diego was opting for a'rustic cabin feel',Nora was more inclined to a'modern, urban, open' space, leaving the Brothers to find something in-between the two conflicting styles. First, the brothers began with knocking down the dry wall dividing their dining room and kitchen as well as their old kitchen cabinets with a sledgehammer. The two homeowners were then taken on a tour of nearby renovated homes to learn about the features they can and can't live without. Jonathan then presented the couple two design options that showcase different ways their house could be re-imagined. After coming to a decision, the brothers told the pair of their plan to add new lighting features to the newly open plan room as well as adding hard wood floor and sleeker fittings. The brothers added trendy light fittings, new modern furniture with a bright green and white colour scheme. As well as their kitchen, the brothers also gave the exterior of the home a chic make over, adding low maintenance landscaping, new grass fresh and a coat of chic grey paint to the external walls. While Nora and Diego's initial budget for their new home was $100,000, the overall project came in at $99,500, despite the brothers originally fearing the ambitious project would leave the couple out of pocket. The couple were over the moon with their home's dramatic transformation, with Nora insisting: :'I love it. I love it. This looks like something out of a dream.' A shocked Diego added: 'Is this our house?' Tearing up, Nora went on: 'Thank you so much. It's so beautiful. It mixes earthy and modern, it's so bright. It feels very California.'

30,Biden's campaign shrugs off 'desperate smear' by Trump after president questions former veep's 'cognitive decline',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095673/Bidens-campaign-shrugs-desperate-smear-Trump-tweet-cognitive-decline.html,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday questioned Joe Biden's cognitive capabilities when he retweeted an accusation from 2016 presidential candidate Jill Stein on the matter, which the former vice president's campaign called the latest in a series of 'desperate smears.' 'Biden's team won't let him do interviews. He made 2 short teleprompter speeches in Missouri this weekend & both generated massive gaffes that went viral. You can't beat Trump by trying to hide to avoid the issue of #BidensCognitiveDecline. How is this not a massive red flag?,' Stein wrote and Trump retweeted. Stein was accused by Democrats of playing a spoiler role in the 2016 presidential primary by taking votes from Hillary Clinton in states like Michigan, which Bernie Sanders won and hopes to do so again in today's primary. Biden has done some TV interviews in the past week. He appeared on Lawrence O'Donnell's MSNBC show Monday night and was on the 'Today' Show last week. He did not appear on any of the Sunday morning public affairs shows while Sanders did interviews on four of them. The former vice president called Trump's criticism 'sad' and part of a series of 'desperate smears' at Biden as he surges ahead of Sanders. 'It's painfully obvious that Donald Trump and his campaign are getting more scared to face Joe Biden by the day. And they should be. We saw huge turnout numbers on Super Tuesday -- especially in swing districts -- with Biden winning big in the places Trump needs to keep his job. Trump and his allies have been lobbing these desperate smears at Joe Biden for 10 months. Super Tuesday made it clear they aren't working, and they won't work this fall either. Sad!,' Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo told Dailymail.com in a statement. Biden is expected to do well in Tuesday's round of primary contests, which would put more pressure on Sanders to exit the race. Trump has been advocating the claim that Democratic officials are trying to push Sanders out of the race on Biden's behalf, which the former vice president and his supporters have denied. In recent days, Biden has shortened the time he speaks at campaign rallies, which has raised questions about his stamina. Early on in the Democratic primary process, Biden faced questions about his health when he made several verbal gaffes on the campaign trail. On Saturday, Biden spoke for seven minutes in St. Louis this weekend and for 15 minutes at his next stop in Kanas City. Sanders' campaign also has raised questions about Biden's speaking time. 'Bernie has three public events just today in two different states, each speaking engagement extending for close to an hour,' Sanders campaign manager FaizShakir tweeted on Saturday amid reports of Biden's shortened speaking time. Ironically, in the past Biden has faced criticism for the opposite: being a loquacious speaker who speeches drag on. Biden is 77 years old while Sanders is 78 and Trump is 73. All are in the age category for greater risk of coronavirus. But none of the contenders have entertained the notion of closing campaign rallies even as large gatherings like the SXSW convention have been canceled. 'Iâ€™m looking up to the CDC to get guidance on that,' Biden told MSNBC Monday night when asked if he'd continue to hold campaign rallies. He noted he's no longer shaking hands on the rope line with attendees. He said he 'waved to people, went through, touched arms, fist bumped, that kind of thing. And I think youâ€™re going to see more of that on the part of everyone,' he noted. At Biden's campaign rally in Detroit Monday night, volunteers squirted hand sanitizer into people's hands before they came into the venue. Trump has said repeatedly he will continue to hold rallies despite the coronavirus scares. The president was seen shaking hands with supporters when he landed in Orlando, Fla., on Monday for a campaign fundraiser. Sanders also said his campaign would continue despite fears of the Coronavirus outbreak. Asked if and the other candidates - Biden and Trump - should limit their travel and avoid crowds, Sanders told CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday:'In the best of all possible worlds, maybe. But right now, we're running as hard as we can.'"
31,Trump's Afghan withdrawal begins: US starts military pull-out from two bases despite Taliban conducting dozens of recent low-level attacks against Afghan forcesÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095481/US-begins-military-pullout-two-Afghan-bases.html,"The United States has begun withdrawing troops from two Afghan bases despite the Taliban conducting dozens of low-level attacks against Afghan forces. The US military spokesman in Afghanistan Sonny Leggett said in a statement Tuesday that the military had begun its 'conditions-based reduction of forces to 8,600 over 135 days.' Currently, the US has about 13,000 soldiers in Afghanistan - 8,000 of whom are involved in training and advising Afghanistan's National Security Forces, while about 5,000 are involved in anti-terror operations and militarily supporting the Afghan army when they are requested. The US will close five of its 20 bases across the country. Troops have started leaving one base in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province in the south, and another base in Herat in the east, a US official told AFP on the condition of anonymity. America also praised Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's promise to start releasing Taliban prisoners after he had delayed for over a week. The US-Taliban deal signed on February 29 was touted as Washington's effort to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan. The next crucial step was to be intra-Afghan talks in which all factions including the Taliban would negotiate a road map for their country's future. But Ghani and his main political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies on Monday. Abdallah and the elections complaints commission had charged fraud in last year's vote. The dueling inaugurations have thrown plans for talks with the Taliban into chaos, although Ghani said Tuesday that he'd start putting together a negotiating team. The disarray on the Afghan government side is indicative of the uphill task facing Washington's peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad as he tries to get Afghanistan's bickering leadership to come together. In a tweet on Tuesday, Khalilzad said he hoped the two leaders can 'come to an agreement on an inclusive and broadly accepted government. We will continue to assist.' Ghani had been dragging his feet on releasing some 5,000 Taliban prisoners, something agreed to in the US-Taliban deal. Ghani promised Monday to announce a decree to free the prisoners, after the US and a number of foreign dignitaries appeared to back his claim to the presidency by sending their representatives to his inauguration. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released a statement Monday saying, 'We also welcome President Ghani's announcement that he will issue a decree March 10 on Taliban prisoner release.' Taliban officials said late Monday that a flurry of biometric identifications were being conducted on Taliban prisoners, hinting at a mass release, according to prisoners currently in lockup. The Taliban officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to the media. Pompeo also said he 'strongly opposed' the establishment of a parallel government in Kabul, despite the early signs of one emerging. Abdullah had quickly sent his vice-presidents to occupy the official offices on Monday, ahead of Ghani's plan to send his vice presidents to their offices Tuesday. Pompeo warned against 'any use of force to resolve political differences.' Both candidates - but particularly Abdullah - are backed by warlords with heavily armed militias, underscoring fears they could use force to back their candidate. The US has said its partial troop withdrawal over an 18-month period provided for in the deal will be linked to the Taliban keeping their promises to help fight terror in Afghanistan, but not to the success of talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. On the weekend, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said the insurgent group was committed to their agreement with the United States and called on Washington to do its part to make sure their prisoners were freed. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a rocket attack that took place during Ghani's inauguration ceremony. IS also claimed a brutal attack last week on a gathering of minority Shiites that killed 32 and injured scores more. The US in reaching its deal with the Taliban said they expected the Taliban, which has been battling Afghanistan's IS affiliate, to further aid in the effort to defeat IS."
32,Weinstein's lawyers argue he deserves a break on his prison sentence and should get only five years because he's already suffered a 'historic' fall from grace,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093963/Weinstein-lawyers-seek-mercy-sent-historic-fall.html,"With Harvey Weinstein facing sentencing this week, his lawyers argued Monday that the disgraced movie mogul deserves mercy in his New York City rape case because he's already suffered a ""historic"" fall from grace and is dealing with serious health issues. Weinstein's defense team asked a judge in court papers to consider a sentence of only five years, far short of the potential 29-year maximum term allowed by law. The papers argue Weinstein should get credit for supporting various charitable causes during his rise to one of Hollywood's most powerful producers. On the health front, the 67-year-old Weinstein is dealing with heart problems, ramifications of unsuccessful back surgery stemming from a car crash last summer and a condition that requires shots in his eyes so he does not go blind, his lawyers have said. The filing came in advance of WeinsteinÂ´s sentencing on Wednesday for his conviction last month on one count of criminal sex act for forcibly performing oral sex on a woman in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for a 2013 attack on another woman. His lawyers had contended at trial that any sexual contact was consensual. On the criminal sex act count, Weinstein faces a minimum of five years in prison and a maximum of 25 years in prison, while the third-degree rape count carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison. The judge could have the sentences run concurrently. The disgraced film producer is caged in a dorm-style cell in New York's notorious Rikers Island prison with two other inmates, a source claimed Sunday. He's currently being treated for a concussion after falling and hitting his head in prison, it has been reported. His spokesperson Juda Engelmayer told Page Six:'He's miserable but trying to be optimistic as best he can. He has had a lot of time to think about his life and be humbled, but he thinks it's going to be a long, uphill battle from here.' He added that adjusting to jail life has been especially difficult without the aid of his walker. On Saturday night, Weinstein fell over after trying to walk on his own. 'He fell on his head and thinks he has a concussion,' Engelmayer said. 'His head has been pounding since yesterday.' Details of his supposed prison set-up were disclosed following reports in the US that he was given his own wing at the prison, which is so grim it is being shut down by New York City in 2026. The disgraced movie mogul is housed in the North Infirmary Command with two 'older gentlemen,' his spokesperson added. An official at the city's Department of Corrections claimed that he was being kept isolated for fears other prisoners might attack him. The news website TMZ said he was given 24-hour security and medical care. A source close to the movie mogul said he had already had a fall that required medical attention. He had been accused of getting special treatment because after his conviction on February 24, instead of going straight to Rikers, he was taken to hospital, where he stayed for ten days. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital by ambulance immediately after being found guilty when he complained of chest pains. Weinstein had a four-hour operation to put a stent in his heart, but was deemed healthy enough to move last Friday. He was then taken from Bellevue in New York to Rikers Island. His legal team had hoped he would stay at the hospital until his sentencing. "
33,"'Hypocrite' Prince Andrew is 'torturing' Epstein's victims by offering to 'speak to US authorities, then shutting the door', claims their lawyerÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094865/Hypocrite-Prince-Andrew-torturing-Jeffrey-Epsteins-victims-claims-lawyer.html,"Prince Andrew's failure to speak to the FBI is inflicting more pain and suffering on Jeffrey Epstein's victims who feel like they are in a 'torture chamber', their lawyer has claimed today. Gloria Allred, who represents five women who were allegedly abused by the Duke of York's paedophile friend, has revealed she sent a letter to the royal's Windsor home urging him to help the authorities but has not had any reply. Ms Allred also believes that claims Andrew has not been contacted by the authorities in the US are false. She said: â€˜This is so hypocritical on the part of Prince Andrew. There is this drip drip drip and this torture chamber where he says he will speak to them, then he wonâ€™t, then he will with conditions. This does nothing but inflict more pain and suffering on the victimsâ€™. Ms Allred told the BBC:â€˜Prince Andrew didnâ€™t say what he meant or mean what he said when he was sympathetic to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and that he would speak to the authorities, the FBI and the Department of Justice if required. Heâ€™s shutting the door. 'I understand he has been contacted by the authorities. I sent a letter to his home in December on behalf of the victims asking him to speak to the FBI. He doesnâ€™t have to come here â€“ he can speak to them in the UK'. The Duke of York hasâ€˜completely shut the doorâ€™ on co-operating voluntarily with US investigators over the Jeffrey Epstein case, a top New York prosecutor said yesterday. In a statement which raised the possibility of a transatlantic legal battle, outspoken US attorney Geoffrey Berman said the American authorities are now â€˜consideringâ€™ further options. His extraordinary broadside came days after details emerged of the high-powered legal team assembled by the Duke of York as the FBI continues to investigate his close association with paedophile Epstein. He is being advised by extradition expert Clare Montgomery QC, who previously fought to keep Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from facing justice. Prince Andrew, 60, was a friend of Epstein, the convicted sex offender and millionaire financier who killed himself last August while in custody in New York awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The Queenâ€™s second son denies all claims of sexual misconduct relating to the Epstein case but has stepped back from public duties after an interview with the BBC about their friendship backfired spectacularly. Yesterday Mr Berman, US attorney for the southern district of New York, said: â€˜Contrary to Prince Andrewâ€™s very public offer to co-operate with our investigation into Epsteinâ€™s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary co-operation and our office is considering its options.â€™ The duke told the BBC in November that he was â€˜willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations if requiredâ€™. But in January Mr Berman accused him of failing to help the FBIâ€™s Epstein probe, saying he had provided â€˜zero co-operationâ€™ despite a request for an interview. He suggested the prince had rebuffed all attempts by federal prosecutors to interview him. At the time, an â€˜angry and bewilderedâ€™ Andrew denied claims that he had snubbed the FBIâ€™s Epstein inquiry, friends said. A source close to the prince claimed: â€˜Nothing could be further from the truth.â€™ He was in fact â€˜more than happy to talkâ€™ but â€˜hasnâ€™t been approached by them yetâ€™, the source insisted. Andrew has categorically denied having any knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing teenage girls. He has also strenuously denied claims made by Virginia Roberts that she was forced to have sex with him on three occasions â€“ in London, New York and on Epsteinâ€™s private Caribbean island. Miss Roberts alleges she first had sex with Andrew in 2001 when she was 17 after being trafficked by Epstein. She said she was flown on Epsteinâ€™s private jet to London to meet the duke and the pair were photographed together in the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epsteinâ€™s former girlfriend. Miss Montgomery, who has been hired by the duke, is Britainâ€™s most respected extradition lawyer. In 1999 she represented Pinochet in front of the Law Lords when he faced multiple allegations of human rights abuses. Attempts to extradite him were dropped after he was ruled unfit to stand trial. Buckingham Palace refuses to comment on Andrewâ€™s legal battle with the US authorities, saying the matter is being dealt with by the princeâ€™s legal team, which is yet to issue a statement.  During his ill-fated Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew dismissed his four-day visit to paedophile Jeffrey Epsteinâ€™s New York â€˜house of depravityâ€™ by describing it as a â€˜convenientâ€™ place to stay while he broke off their friendship in an â€˜honourableâ€™ way. Speaking for the first time about the 2010 visit to the Â£60 million Manhattan home â€“ just five months after the financier left jail following his conviction for child sex charges â€“ the Duke of York confirmed he attended a dinner party there on December 2 before his infamous â€˜walk in the parkâ€™ with the shamed US financier three days later. He revealed that it was during that stroll through Central Park â€“ captured in a picture that went around the world, haunting him ever since â€“ that he finally broke off their 11-year friendship. When asked by Emily Maitlis why he stayed with a convicted sex offender, Andrew replied: â€˜Ever since this has happened and since this has become, as it were, public knowledge that I was there, Iâ€™ve questioned myself as to why did I go and what was I doing and was it the right thing to do? â€˜I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted it was inappropriate for us to be seen together. â€˜I had a number of people counsel me in both directions, either to go and see him or not to go and see him and I took the judgment call that because this was serious and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chickenâ€™s way of doing it I had to go and see him and talk to him.â€™ He said the photograph in the park was taken when he broke the news to Epstein they could no longer be friends. â€˜We had an opportunity to go for a walk in the park and that was the conversation coincidentally that was photographed, which was when I said to him, I said, â€œLook, because of what has happened I donâ€™t think it is appropriate that we should remain in contactâ€ and by mutual agreement during that walk in the park we decided that we would part company and I left, I think it was the next day [in fact it was two days later] and I never had any contact with him from that day forward.â€™ Incredibly, the Prince cited the reason for breaking off the friendship as the â€˜attendant scrutinyâ€™ he was under â€“ rather than the fact Epstein had pleaded guilty and served time for child sex offences. Andrew said Epsteinâ€™s reaction to his decision was â€˜understandingâ€™, adding: â€˜He didnâ€™t go into any great depth in the conversationâ€¦ except to say that heâ€™d acceptedâ€¦ a plea bargain, heâ€™d served his time and he was carrying on with his life, if you see what I mean.â€™ â€˜And I said, â€œYes but Iâ€™m afraid to say thatâ€™s as maybe but with all the attendant scrutiny on me then I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a wise thing to do.â€ â€™ His comments came after the newspaper revealed that a highly respected former Royal protection officer has raised questions about Andrew's 'alibi' for the night he allegedly had sex with Ms Roberts in London. Ms Roberts claims that she was flown to London by Epstein in March 2001 when she was 17 and coerced into having sex with the Duke. This was the first of three alleged sexual encounters with the Prince. Andrew, 60, has categorically denied the claims, and in November he told Newsnight's Emily Maitlis: 'I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.' In an interview with Datelinelast year, Ms Giuffre said: 'I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that even royalty were involved. 'He was a prince. He was famous. It just stuck out in my mind. I grew upwatching Disney, and princesses and princes were the good people in the world, and he wasn't.' Here is a timeline of the duke's relationship with Epstein. - 1999 Andrew first meets Epstein, reportedly introduced through his friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell. Andrew welcomes Epstein to the Queen's private Scottish retreat in Aberdeenshire. Andrew later says he sees Epstein 'infrequently', adding 'probably no more than only once or twice a year'. - 2000 Andrew and Ms Maxwell are seen on holiday with Epstein at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Epstein and Ms Maxwell attend a party at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen to mark Andrew's 40th birthday, the Princess Royal's 50th, the Queen Mother's 100th and Princess Margaret's 70th. - 2001 Virginia Roberts claims to have had sex with Andrew 'three times, including one orgy', with the first encounter allegedly taking place in Ms Maxwell's London townhouse. Ms Roberts claims to have had sex with Andrew on two more occasions, at Epstein's New York home and at an 'orgy' on his private island in the Caribbean. - 2008 Epstein admits prostituting minors and is sentenced to 18 months in prison. - 2010 Epstein is released from jail. Andrew is photographed with the disgraced Epstein in New York's Central Park. Footage emerges years later, reportedly shot on December 6 2010, showing him inside Epstein's Manhattan mansion, from where he is seen looking out from a large door of the property waving a woman goodbye after Epstein leaves to get into a chauffeur-driven car. - 2011 The duke quits his role as UK trade envoy after the fallout from the Central Park photos. - 2015 Buckingham Palace denies Andrew has committed any impropriety after he is named in US court documents related to Epstein. A woman, later named in reports as Ms Roberts, alleges in papers filed in Florida that she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, which is under the age of consent in the state. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Andrew, in his first public engagement since he was embroiled in the allegations, responds, saying: 'Firstly I think I must, and want, for the record, to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks. 'I just wish to reiterate, and to reaffirm, the statements that have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.' In April the claims against Andrew are struck from US civil court records following a federal judge's ruling. - 2019 Newly released legal documents show that Johanna Sjoberg, another alleged Epstein victim, claimed Andrew touched her breast while sitting on a couch inside the US billionaire's Manhattan apartment in 2001. Buckingham Palace said the allegations are 'categorically untrue'. Epstein is found dead in his jail cell on August 10, having killed himself after being charged with sex trafficking. Later that month a pilot on Epstein's private jet claims Andrew was a passenger on past flights with the financier and Ms Roberts. The Sun newspaper reported that David Rodgers said in a testimony released in August that Epstein, Andrew and the-then 17-year-old travelled to the US Virgin Islands on April 11 2001. Buckingham Palace describes the evidence statement as having 'a number of inconsistencies' and said that Andrew was on a different continent in some cases. Following Epstein's death, a statement from the palace says that Andrew is 'appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes'. Breaking his silence on the issue for the first time since 2015, Andrew then releases a statement on August 24 saying: 'At no stage during the limited time I spent with him (Epstein) did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.' On November 16, the prince gave a 'disastrous' BBC interview in which he spoke about his friendship with Epstein and addressed allegations of his own sexual conduct. He faced a barrage of criticism following his television appearance, with the royal accused of a lack of empathy with Epstein's victims. During the interview, Andrew, questioned by Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, twice stated his relationship with Epstein, who died in jail while facing sex trafficking charges, had some 'seriously beneficial outcomes', giving him the opportunity to meet people and prepare for a future role as a trade envoy. The duke denied he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage, saying one encounter in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party. The same alleged sexual liaison, which the American said began with the royal sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp, was factually wrong as the duke said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat. He cast doubt on the authenticity of a picture that appears to show Andrew with his arm around the waist of Mrs Giuffre, when a teenager."
34,"'After this, we're free!' Royal fans speculate about what Prince Harry whispered to Meghan before sharing knowing smile at their final royal appearanceÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8095097/Royal-fans-wild-touching-moment-Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle.html,"Royal fans are going wild over a touching moment shared between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during the Commonwealth Service on their final royal appearance. The Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 38, joined the Queen, 93, and other senior royals at Westminster Abbey yesterday in their last official duty as working royals. Towards the end of the service, the couple could be seen swaying as a steel pan band played a Commonwealth Melody, before Prince Harry mouthed: 'Meghan', and the two shared a loving smile between them. Many of those watching couldn't help but notice the moment, with one commenting: 'This is ""After this, we are done and we are free baby"" look.' A lip reader told MailOnline Prince Harry was humming along to the tune of the music in the service.  One said: 'Harry's like, ""Sis, we're about done with this sh******.' Another suggested the couple were thinking: 'We're about to leave this hot mess.' One excited royal watcher commented: 'I love their connection, it's so pure. They both look stunning but Meghan is slaying! Omg! So gorgeous. Wow.' Another wrote: 'Harry's like, ""Hey babe. We're almost done here.""' Meanwhile another wrote: 'This is love.' One commented: 'That's adorable', while another wrote: 'Love their connection.' The moment, which happened towards the end of the Commonwealth Service, came as the South-London based Melodians Steel Orchestra performed. While Meghan could be seen swaying to the music, Prince Harry appeared to be humming along to the song. At one stage, he turned to his wife, getting her attention by saying: 'Meghan', before the two shared a knowing smile. Prince Harry continued to speak to the Duchess as she leaned in to hear him, before the camera panned away to other attendees. The service yesterday marked the final official event for Prince Harry and Meghan as they prepare to step down from life as senior members of the royal family. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America. The Duchess of Sussex rose to the occasion with her showstopping ensemble, which was widely praised on social media by royal supporters and fashion fans alike within minutes of her arrival. The elegant, long-sleeved dress is thought to be a bespoke creation by Emilia Wickstead, a favourite of both Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge, 38. The fitted long-sleeved dress falls a few inches below the knee and features cleverly-placed darts on the torso and waistline that serve to flatter the Duchess's svelte frame. A dramatically draped asymmetric cape that falls over the right shoulder adds a fashion-forward twist to the otherwise classic cut. Continuing a recent streak of monochrome looks, Meghan wore a matching green hat with net detailing on the brim and folded in an oversized flower structure on the side."
35,'She looks like a Cheshire cat': Piers Morgan blasts Meghan Markle who has 'got everything she wants' despite Prince Harry and Prince William 'at war' over Megxit... as he asks 'what would Diana think?Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094747/Piers-Morgan-blasts-Meghan-Markle-got-wants.html,"Piers Morgan today launched a scathing criticism of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in the wake of their last appearance as senior royals. The Good Morning Britain host hit out at the pair for 'being very divisive' and failing to 'earn respect' from the British public. He argued people should be 'asking if the Queen is okay', rather than Meghan, who he claimed, 'looks like a Cheshire cat.' His comments came as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex prepare to bow out of royal duties and embrace their new life in North America. Piers was discussing Meghan and Harry taking part in a Commonwealth Service in Westminster Abbey, their final appearance as senior members of the royal family. But he noted there was a 'glacial' tension between brothers William and Harry which was palpable at the service, adding, 'What would Diana think? Her boys are barely able to speak to one another.' He saidKate could 'barely look at Meghan' during yesterday's service, adding, 'Prince Edward was Kofi Annan in all this.' He then argued people should be asking if the Queen is 'okay', rather than the Sussexes. Piers said: 'A lot of the tension surely is that they [Harry and Meghan] have been holding the royal family, the Queen to ransom. 'These two have been laying the law down to the Queen. 'This obsession we have with, are Meghan and Harry ok â€“ theyâ€™re fine- theyâ€™re going off to Hollywood to become superstars. 'I bet the Queenâ€™s not been ok. Her grandsons are at war. 'People ask, ""is poor Meghan ok?"" but she looks fine to me. Sheâ€™s spent the last few days looking like a Cheshire cat. Sheâ€™s got everything she wanted. 'My sole thought is, is the Queen ok? I think sheâ€™s had a horrible year and itâ€™s been helped in my view by this quite selfish conduct.' He then asked why the couple did not bring their son Archie to the UK with them to see his grandmother and said Harry and Meghan 'did not like the criticism.' Piers added: 'Youâ€™ve got to earn support, youâ€™ve got to earn respect but I think theyâ€™re very divisive. 'They didnâ€™t like all the criticism. I thought it was perfectly justified. The papers were positive before they only got criticising when stuff was worth criticising. 'Wherever Meghan goes, people get split. Sheâ€™s split from her family, split from her dad, split Harry from William, split from her friends. 'Sheâ€™s like the old Henry the 8th era â€“ 'off with their heads'.' From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America."

Over the weekend, he also shared anInstagram story revealing he was enjoying an 'incredible' meal at the five-star luxury Coworth Park hotel, which is just 15 minutes drive from Frogmore Cottage. Daniel shared a short video showcasing Meghan's beauty with his 138,000 followers online earlier today. Alongside the caption, he posted a red, green and blue heart, to represent the bold colours the royal has chosen over her final royal appearances. Celebrities and close friends of the Duchess were quick to flood the comments to praise Daniel's incredible talent. Her best friend and former stylist Jessica Mulroney was one of the first to comment, posting a red heart on the image. Meanwhile actress Mindy Kahling also shared her thoughts, writing: 'So dreamy Daniel.' Meghan has been widely praised for her showstopping looks in her final appearances before stepping down as a senior member of The Firm, and giving upher title at the end of the month as part of their 'Megxit' departure deal. And it appears Daniel was on hand for each of the evening events, including the Endeavour Award's, the Mountbatten Festival of Music and the Commonwealth Service yesterday. On Thursday, Meghan wowed in a dazzling turquoise Victoria Beckham gown while at the Endeavour Award's, sweeping her hair back into a stylish pony-tail. And on Saturday night, the Duchess looked showstoppingred full-length Â£1,295 Safiyaa dress, jewelled Simone Rocha earrings, and gorgeous red Stuart Weitzman heels for theMountbatten Festival of Music. Yesterday, she attended the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey, marking her final public appearance as a senior royal. The Duchess donned an emerald gown for the event, sweeping her locks into a delicate braided bun tied beneath her hat at the nape of her neck. Her make-up consisted of dramatic, dark eyes, defined brows, bronzed cheek and a touch of rose pink lip colour. Daniel is believed to have known Meghan for over a decade, having met her while the former actress worked on Suits. He has remained in contact with the Duchess throughout her life in the royal family and has often seen her over the last year. Daniel was by Meghan's side on her wedding day as he perfected her make-up andattended her famous baby shower in New York last February alongside celebrities like Gayle King and Serena Williams. He was one of the first to visit the Duke and Duchess of Sussex when they moved into Frogmore Cottage shortly before Archie's birth. And the makeup artist sparked rumours he could be one of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor's secret godparents when he shared pictures from London in the days after the baby's christening. The royal also surprised Daniel in New York for his birthday last September, with the makeup artist revealing the news by sharing a snap on Instagram of a plate of cupcakes."
37,Extending an olive branch? Prince William and Kate Middleton share photos of Prince Harry and Meghan after their frosty meeting,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8095497/Fans-praise-Cambridges-sweet-gesture-share-snaps-Prince-Harry-Meghan.html,"Royal enthusiasts have praised the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for sharing snaps of all the royals who attended the Commonwealth Day service, including Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. The KensingtonRoyal Instagram account, which documents the work of Prince William, 37, and Kate, 38, posted a selection of photographs from the annual Westminster Abbey eventyesterday. They show the Duchess of Sussex, 38, meeting heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua; the Duke of Sussex, 35, speaking with singer Craig David; as well as snaps of the Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince Edward, and the Countess of Wessex. Social media users were quick to applaud William and Kate for including photos of all the royal family members in attendance at the service, labelling it a 'sweet, classy gesture'. One impressed person said: 'Nice gesture of William and Kate (W&K) posting pictures of MM (Meghan Markle).' Another added: 'How lovely that you have included photos of all the family - not just yourselves as other have.' A third wrote: 'So sweet to include beautiful pictures of all the family members that were there today.' Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were criticised for only including pictures of themselves in their Instagram post. The SussexRoyal account shared two snaps to mark the Commonwealth Day service, both showing just Meghan and Prince Harry as they spoke with guests. Royal fans couldn't help but note the difference between the two Instagram accounts' posts, with one person saying: 'They only have pictures of themselves whereas the Cambridges and other royals have pictures of the family.' A second wrote: 'Learn from the Cambridges. They really include the ""members"" of the family', while another said: 'Would it have been nice to include a picture of Her Majesty The Queen? Yes.' The service yesterday marked the final official event for Prince Harry and Meghan as they prepare to step down from life as senior members of the royal family. The Sussexes appeared to exchange an awkward 'hello' with Prince William and Kateat the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey yesterday afternoon. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked in ahead of William and Kate - the first public meeting of the two brothers and their wives since Megxit was announced two months ago - before Prince Charles and Camilla also arrived and the Queen then made an entrance to trumpet fanfare and cheers from crowds outside. Unlike last year, Harry and Meghan were conducted to their seats at the church in London, rather than waiting for the Queen's arrival and walking through with the monarch and key royals as they did in March 2019. Once seated, the royals' position on the chairs was based on their ranks within the family, with Charles next to the Queen due to him being first-in-line, followed by William in second, and Harry in sixth. They took similar positions last year, although Meghan was next to Prince Andrew, who has since stepped down from royal duties. Meghan was seen to mouth 'hi' and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a 'hello', as the Cambridges took their seats near the High Altar. Harry also said 'hello' and smiled at his brother. It comes after Harry admitted last October that he and his brother are on 'different paths' and have good and bad days in their relationship."
38,"Pensive, subdued and distracted... the day Prince Harry signed off from all he has known: ROBERT HARDMAN on the Duke of Sussex's final farewell to royal life at Westminster Abbey",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093265/Prince-Harry-signs-known.html,"The royal Range Rover was already outside, engine running, waiting to take him off to his new, post-royal life. But even at the very last moment of his last formal engagement as a top tier member of the Royal Family, we had a brief parting glimpse of the old, cheeky, impish Prince Harry. All through this Commonwealth Day service of celebration at Westminster Abbey, the Royal Family and other VIPs had followed the new abbey edict: No shaking hands. It left everyone nodding away respectfully like a mass gathering of Japanese waiters (apart from the Prince of Wales, who offered all and sundry a palms-together â€˜namasteâ€™). Seeing the funny side of it all, the Duke of Sussex could not resist breaking ranks at the end as he was introduced to one of the performers, pop singer Craig David. Sticking out his right arm, he gave him an â€˜elbow bumpâ€™ greeting and then cracked a joke. It was one of the lighter moments during an afternoon which, at times, left the duke looking pensive, distracted, even subdued. Understandably so. Here in a church bound up with his familyâ€™s history all the way back to Edward the Confessor â€“ and where, most notably, he had to endure the funeral of his mother in 1997 â€“ he was signing off from all that he has known. On arrival, Harry and Meghan had to slot in to that cast-iron dynastic pecking order â€“ in this case entering after the Earl and Countess of Wessex but before the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. There was fleeting chit-chat between them but there will have been plenty of private time already for whatever farewells the Sussexes have in mind. The abbey was not the place for them. Instead, it was a case of grin and bear it. The duchess beamed away all afternoon to the point of facial exhaustion. The dukeâ€™s mind frequently appeared to wander. Come the end of the month, Harry and Meghan will park their â€˜HRHâ€™ titles and cross the dividing line from royalty to celebrity. They do so in the hope of becoming â€“ in the jargon of their new transatlantic chums â€“ â€˜philanthropreneursâ€™ or â€˜change-makersâ€™. Yesterday was their last public day as members of an institution that stands for continuity and leaves all that â€˜changeâ€™ stuff to elected politicians. However, the couple clearly wanted to leave with dignity and not in a sulk, as happened when they made their initial dash for the exit in January. Back then, they slapped down a list of demands on the table, took great umbrage when those were not accepted and sloped off to Canada after a somewhat petulant valedictory speech by the duke. This time, they left on a high. No member of the Royal Family needs reminding how important the Commonwealth is to the Queen. It means a very great deal to its future head, the Prince of Wales, who has visited 20 Commonwealth nations in the past year alone. And it surely means a lot to the Sussexes, too. They talked about it excitedly from the moment they got engaged; the duchess ensured that her wedding dress was embroidered with the flower of every single Commonwealth nation (a gesture that touched the Queen greatly); they both went on to accept a range of Commonwealth patronages. In other words, the Sussexes more than any other royal couple have tied themselves to the 54 countries of the Queenâ€™s â€˜family of nationsâ€™. And it is the Commonwealth that is going to remain a sort of royal umbilical cord, a link between the Sussexesâ€™ future work and their past. For though Prince Harry has had to relinquish his role as the Queenâ€™s Commonwealth Youth Ambassador â€“ for the simple reason that this was an official royal role â€“ he has not severed his ties with the Queenâ€™s Commonwealth Trust. That is a new charity which falls outside the immediate control of the Royal Household, the Government or the Commonwealth Secretariat. Yet it carries the Queenâ€™s blessing and authority in its quest to provide direct assistance at a local level to dynamic community projects run by the potential Commonwealth leaders of tomorrow. Harry is its president, Meghan is its vice-president and it includes some of the Queenâ€™s most able and respected former staff â€“ including two former private secretaries â€“ among its trustees. Similarly, having succeeded the Queen as patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the oldest of its kind in the world, the duchess remains closely involved. Only yesterday morning, prior to the abbey service, she was holding a meeting with association staff at Buckingham Palace. These connections will continue and, it is hoped, mature. Yesterday was a reminder of the quirkiness of the Commonwealth. As well as the glorious fusion of the abbey organ, the State Trumpeters and the Grenadier Guards, we also had Scottish dancers, a brilliant steel orchestra, African drummers and a brace of pop stars in both Alexandra Burke and Craig David. The sermon came not from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Instead, it was Olympic and world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua who stepped up to the pulpit to deliver a thoughtful and rather moving address on being a very proud Brit who was equally proud of his Nigerian heritage This service ended up at the abbey only because, in the early days, no other church would host such an overtly multi-faith event (most of the Commonwealth is non-Christian). Yet the Queen was determined it should have a spiritual rather than a secular home. Since the abbey is a â€˜royal peculiarâ€™ that answers not to a bishop but to the Queen herself, she directed that the Commonwealth should be celebrated here. And so it has been ever since. In a similar way, the Commonwealth now offers a useful means of leaving the door ajar for the two â€˜royal peculiarsâ€™ of the House of Windsor as they start their new life. And no one will be keener to keep it open than the Queen."
39,'That's not how to greet your brother!' Royal fans accuse Prince William and Kate of 'ignoring' Meghan and Prince Harry in 'painful' Commonwealth Service encounterÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8092421/Royal-fans-accuse-Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-ignoring-Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry.html,"Royal fans accused Prince William and Kate Middleton of 'ignoring' Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in a 'painful' greeting as they attended the Commonwealth Service today. The Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 38, reunited for the Duke, 37, and Duchess of Cambridge, 38, for the first time todaysince Megxit was announced two months ago. But as the couple greeted in Westminster Abbey today, many royal followers were left feeling upset and couldn't help commenting on the 'cold' greeting. One wrote: 'That looks painful', while another commented: 'This really upset me. William and Kate, so rude.' Another added: 'Okay, even I have got to admit that looks cold. They better had a meetup before so that this was only their second greeting during the day, because that's no way to greet a brother when you first see them.' Meanwhile another wrote: 'I'm sad about this...didn't acknowledge each other.' One tagged a friend, writing: 'OMG look at this! That looks like a blatant snub by William and Kate.' Another added: 'That felt cold.' Harry and Meghan were conducted to their seats at the church in London, shortly before Kate and Prince William joined them in the row in front. Meghan was seen to mouth 'hi' and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a 'hello', as the Cambridges took their seat. They appeared to greet Sophie and Edward Wessex before turning to acknowledge the Sussexes. Harry said 'hello' and smiled at his brother and, while Edward partly rose to greet the Cambridges, but Sophie and the Sussexes remained seated. Later,Meghan chatted animatedly to Edward as they waited for the Queen to arrive, with Harry joining in the conversation and putting his arm on the back of Meghan's chair as he did so. Meghan dazzled in a breathtaking green Emilia Wickstead dress with asymmetrical cape and hat by William Chambers. Meanwhile Kate opted for a red ensemble, re-wearing a coat by Catherine Walker and a hat by Sally-Ann Provan. The occasion marked the first time the couples had reunited since the announcement of Prince Harry and Meghan's plans to step down from life in as working royals. It was also their last public royal duty before they walk away from the monarchy. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America. A source previously revealed how Prince Harry left the country on 'bad terms with his brother' after he and Meghan stepped down as senior royals. The rift is said to have begun in 2017 when Prince William warned his younger sibling he was 'moving too fast' with Meghan Markle, People magazine reports. 'They didn't leave on good terms by any means, but they are both relieved that it's over,' the source - described as a friend of the family - said. Harry and Meghan's resignation as senior Royals was said to have widened the gulf between the two siblings, with William understood to be 'incandescent' over his brother's blindsiding of the Family."
40,From genuine warmth to yesterday's glacial exchange: How photos of Kate and Meghan's public outings tell the REAL story of their cooling relations - as one body language expert says it's blatantly clear they're 'not friends',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8095105/How-Kate-Meghans-relationship-gone-glowing-glacial-three-years.html,"A little over two years ago, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex made their first public appearance together at Sandringham on Christmas Day, prompting hopes they would form a close friendship as sisters-in-law. The pair appeared relaxed in each others' company as they joined Princes William and Harry, a warmth that continued into their first joint engagement atthe Royal Foundation Forum in London, under its slogan 'making a difference together'. But fast forward two years, and Kate and Meghan, both 38, were photographed offering a cursory, terse hello in Westminster Abbey for the annual Commonwealth Service yesterday; an exchange that was at best polite and at worst, downright awkward. The minimal interaction was a million miles away from how the two women had appeared on their more laid-back public outings pre-Megxit - including two trips to Wimbledon and one, with their respective broods, at the polo in Berkshire last summer. Femail has asked two leading body language experts, Adrianne Carter and Amana Walker, to examine how the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex' relationship has seemingly deteriorated - going from friendly to frosty - since Prince Harry first announced his love for Meghan in September 2017. DECEMBER 2017: THE HONEYMOON PERIOD Meghan's arrival into the royal family was officially marked on the short walk to St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, Norfolk on Christmas Day 2017. Beaming alongside her prospective sister and brother-in-law, Meghan - and indeed William, Kate and Harry, appear delighted at their new friendship. Says Adrianne Carter of the now-famous images: 'This photo shows two couples happy to be in each otherâ€™s company. There's not much distance between Kate and Meghan, showing no signs of tension or disharmony at this stage.' Even their walk suggested they were in tune, she adds: 'They literally look in step as a foursome. When we feel uncomfortable we will often put distance between ourselves and the object (s) of unease - no sign of that with Kate and Meghan, who are very close in distance too here.' Fellow expert Amana Walker agrees, saying: 'The princes are happy â€“ and that is reflected in Kate and Meghan. This is clearly a new friendship and they are both trying hard. 'The girls are smiling in unison, look relaxed to be with each other and, crucially, are walking side by side. Their body language clearly says ""weâ€™re friends"".' FEBRUARY 2018: RELAXEDAND BECOMING A 'TEAM' By February the following year, Meghan is clearly enjoying her induction to the Firm, as she and Prince Harry attend the first Royal Foundation Forum with Kate and William. The images of a blossoming Kate and a relaxed Meghan show all is still rosy in the royal garden at this point. Walker surmises that Meghan's love for Harry and Kate's pregnancy signal happy times for the royals. She says: 'There is no sign of tension in this photo, Meghan is clearly in love with and very tactile with Harry. 'Kate shows no signs of tension building and looks happy to be sat close, again to Meghan. Both are at ease and acting naturally, with Kate looking relaxed with her hands on her lap. Their body language is still ""open"". They look like a ""team"".' Carter says of their body language in the photos: 'Both Kate and Meghan are still showing relaxed body language. Kate also looks like she is happy with Meghan taking the limelight at this stage. Both are showing genuine smiles in this set of images.' MAY 2018: KATE IS FEELING ON HER GUARD Shortly after Meghan and Harry walk down the aisle after the world has watched them wed on May 21st 2018, the senior royals gather for a family photo - but it's clear the dynamics are starting to change already, suggests Walker. 'Even though this is a wedding, and a happy occasion, Kateâ€™s smile here is forced. 'She is also physically leaning away from Meghan with her arms wrapped around Charlotte protectively. 'Kateâ€™s body language is saying that she is there because she has to be there and not because she wants to be. This photo hides a multitude of emotion.' JUNE 2018: FIRST CRACKS IN THE NEW FRIENDSHIP? It's clear that things aren't quite as relaxed as they once were, says Carter, of the images of Kate and Meghan pictured atTrooping the Colour in June 2018. She explains: 'We see Kate holding herself very rigid in this image. We hold ourselves rigid when we are trying to contain any emotional leakages. She is conscious of not revealing how she really feels in this image.' And Meghan's day-job is coming to the fore here, Carter adds, saying: 'I think we see Meghan the actress, showing a posed, coy smile. She is portraying the image she wants to be captured...' Walker agrees: 'Now we are starting to see a difference. Whatever tension is building behind the scenes is starting to show. 'Kate is focusing clearly on her role and her eyes are fixed ahead â€“ even though she knows how close Meghan is behind her. There is no attempt by Kate to tilt her body or head towards Meghan.' 'Is Meghan trying to ""edge her way in"" by standing close to Kate and tilting her head submissively? Perhaps indicating that she is doing no wrong and wants to be seen in the right light.' OCTOBER - DECEMBER 2018: RUMOURS OF ROYAL RIFT SWIRL By Christmas 2018, the rumour-mill is working overdrive as it's reported that the initial friendship between the two Duchesses has rapidly cooled. While the four royals still sit next to each other at Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018, the warmth appears to have evaporated, say our body language experts. And as the annual stride up to church on Christmas Day 2018 arrives, so does the united front. Comparing the previous year's photo, Carter says that clearly much has changed in their dynamic in the year that's passed. 'Kate and Meghan are having a good go at portraying a friendly image although if you notice the spatial distance between them is not as close as the year before. 'The distance is showing us they are clearly not as close as they were. Both men look like they would rather be anywhere else but here.' MARCH 2019: GROWING APART Monday's photographs of the royals atCommonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey offer a stark contrast in how far perhaps the royals' relationship has drifted. While cracks may have been beginning to show at the same event in March 2019, the brothers and their wives were at least stood next to each. Carter says these images suggest that distance was already on the cards. She says: 'Kate is holding herself very separate from the rest of the group and appears very rigid. Her face is in a neutral-set expression. Again, it looks like she is trying to contain her true feelings and she is very conscious of the spotlight. 'However, Meghan is leaning in as if to show she is interested and part of the group but It's a social smile rather than a genuine smile of enjoyment.' JULY 2019: TRYING TO BUILD BRIDGES VIA TENNIS AND NEW-BORN ARCHIE If cracks are beginning to show, then a shared love of tennis, and a brand new baby in the family - Meghan and Harry's newborn Archie - offer a salve on the relationship by the middle of 2019. Appearing together for the second consecutive year at Wimbledon, Meghan and Kate appear to get on well, says Carter. 'This seems to be a genuinely friendly encounter between Kate and Meghan. The photo showing Kate leaning forward is something we do when we like something (or someone). She adds: 'Kate is tactile, suggesting she feels comfortable to lean forward and to touch. We can do this when we want the other person to feel included and listened to. 'Meghan is showing a relaxed posture and genuine smile but again has the sunglasses on - is the sun really bright or does she want that barrier to hide her eyes?' However, Walker thinks there's obvious tension court-side: 'The lack of warmth between Kate and Meghan is now palpable. They might be standing side-by-side, but they are not together. 'Kate is controlling her feelings via her body language; her face is curt and unresponsive to whatever Meghan is saying. Her eyes are not on Meghan as she is speaking to her and she is physically holding her arms behind her back. 'Meghan is animated â€“ after all, the cameras are on them â€“ and is trying to engage Kate with her hand gestures. 'This looks more like a business conversation and for Kate, this is duty not friendship. A few days earlier, Meghan and Kate take their broods - including newborn Archie to the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day at theBillingbear Polo Club in Berkshire. While Kate and Meghan are physically close, they are moons apart, says Walker. 'Kate may as well be in a different venue to Meghan, the photo shows distance between them. 'Normally when friends are together with babies/small children, there is a real affinity and bond â€“ and that is nowhere to be seen here. 'Kate has physically turned her back on Meghan and has crouched down to attend to Louis, so she is blocking Meghan with her body, avoiding eye contact and staying away by bending down. 'The warmth is no longer there, and if Meghan is struggling with her role or new baby, there is no visible support form Kate. Again, Meghan's sunglasses could suggest she's trying to block out more than just the English sun, adds Carter. 'On a relaxed summer's afternoon we see two mums enjoying time with their children. However, they don't look particularly close apart from they are in the same space. 'Meghan is wearing sunglasses which people sometimes do when they want to hide how they really feel and want some barrier to feel more comfortable. 'We reduce intimacy levels when we wear sunglasses, particularly when the other person isn't wearing them.' MARCH 2020: MEGHAN AND HARRY'S FINAL FAREWELL AND A VERY AWKWARD ENCOUNTER The Sussexes' final farewell to public life for the royal family was apparentlymarred by behind-the-scenes tensions over protocol. The couple were reportedly told tomake their own way to their seats at the front of the abbey before the arrival of other senior royals, alongside the Earl and the Countess of Wessex. When Kate and William arrived, seated a row in front, there was a palpable atmosphere as they exchanged a polite greeting with Meghan and Harry. This time, Walker says it's Prince Harry's face that tells the story. 'Harry is clearly angry and is showing it by avoiding eye contact and giving cursory glances and words to William. 'Meghan is overcompensating (and because she knows she doesnâ€™t have to put up with this for much longer) by smiling profusely and constantly. 'If Kate is happy to see Meghan, she is not showing it. She is seated the furthest away from Meghan and shows no affection from beginning to end. Itâ€™s as if Kate would be glad to see the back of herâ€¦' Carter concludes: 'Kate is holding herself very formally in this photo - she is clearly conscious of the world's spotlight on her I suspect and doesn't want to reveal anything about how she really feels - good or bad - that can be interpreted. She adds: 'When we hold ourselves so rigidly it can be a sign of tension but I suspect it's because she is so conscious of the spotlight. 'Meghan is showing a very relaxed body language posture, almost like the weight of portraying anything other than who she is has gone. Her face is in a gentle genuine smile - she has what she wants and is comfortable.'"
41,Hidden meanings behind Meghan Markle's farewell tour jewelry: Accessories highlight causes close to her heart - including eco-friendly earrings and animal welfare necklace,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8091449/Hidden-meanings-Meghan-Markles-jewels-final-UK-engagements.html,"All eyes have been on the Duchess of Sussex in recent days as she carried out her final engagements as a senior member of the royal family. Now FEMAIL can reveal how Meghan Markle, 38, used the opportunity to shine a light on causes close to her heart by choosing to wear jewellery that align with her personal interests and have connections to charities. From a pair of earrings by an independent, women-led British company to a necklace that benefits an animal welfare charity, Meghan made deliberate wardrobe decisions that champion others. Elsewhere the Duchess chose pieces that carry hidden meanings, such as the 'good luck' necklace that she wore to a school in Dagenham, east London, on Friday. Here, a closer look at what we can learn from Meghan's farewell tour jewellery collection... EARRINGS MADE FROM RECYCLED MATERIALS WORN: On Sunday to church with the Queen at Windsor Castle For her final outing as a senior royal yesterday, the Duchess of Sussex chose the Snowstorm diamond earrings by Canadian jewellers Birks. The earrings were first worn by Meghan shortly before her wedding to Prince Harry in May 2018 and have become a wardrobe staple since. TheDuchess of Sussex showcased her eco-friendly credentials yesterday by donning a pair of earrings by a sustainable British jewellery brand, as she and Prince Harry reunited with the Queen in public for the first time since Megxit. Meghan Markle, 38, selected the Â£140 Daphne circle drop jewels crafted by V by Laura Vann for the church service in Windsor. The mother-of-one wore a black and white monochrome gown for the occasion, sweeping her hair into a soft wave, and tucking a lock behind her ear to reveal the dangling green art-deco earrings. The earrings are describedonline as being crafted from 'recycled silver', with the brand focusing on 'ethical production'. Online the earrings, which are currently out-of-stock, are described as 'a highly anticipated arrival for Autumn Winter 2017', perhaps suggesting the Duchess has had the pieces in her collection for a while. NECKLACE THAT BRINGS GOOD FORTUNE WORN: On Friday for a visit to a school in Dagenham, east London Meghan donned Edge of Ember's Kismet Charm necklace during her appearance at a school in Dagenham on Friday, which features a four-leaf clover as a 'good fortune icon'.

It features afour leaf clover with the lucky number 7, for two doses of good fortune. EARRINGS FOR 'INDEPENDENT WOMEN' WORN: On Thursday night at the Endeavour Awards, London All eyes were on the Duchess of Sussex's eye-catching Â£950 blue Victoria Beckham dress as she arrived for the Endeavour Fund Awards on Thursday night, so she chose to keep things simple when it came to her accessories.

Online, Sophie revealed the message is borrowed from the poem 'The Eternal Song'. The reference is anan ode from the 19th century French poet Rosemonde GÃ©rard which translates to: 'Every day I love you more, more than yesterday less than tomorrow.'

42,Meghan's parting tribute to Diana: Duchess' green dress and hat at Commonwealth service bears VERY striking resemblance to late royal's 1982 maternity look,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8094959/Meghan-Markle-paid-tribute-Princess-Diana-identical-ensemble.html,"The Duchess of Sussex looked luminous as she attendedthe Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on Monday, wearing a green ensemble that closely resembled an outfit worn by Princess Diana in 1982. Meghan Markle, 38, cut a stylish figure as she attended her last official engagement in London before stepping down from royal duties alongside Prince Harry, 35, and returning to Canada. The mother-of-one opted for a caped emerald green dress by Emilia Wickstead and matching hat with a netted fascinator byWilliam Chambers for the much-anticipated event yesterday. And, perhaps in a nod to her late mother-in-law, the look closely resembled that worn by Diana when she was pregnant with Prince William in 1982, aged 22, wearing a green coat dress and similarly netted fascinator. In the picture Diana can be seen attending Trooping the Colour on Buckingham Palace's balcony alongside Prince Charles, the Queen and Prince Philip, just 11 days before she was to give birth to eldest son Prince William on June 21 1982. The comparison between the two looks was quickly picked up by fan account'Princess Diana Iconic', who shared a side-by-side of the two women. Captioning the snaps, 'New tribute in Meghan's look to Diana', they quickly racked up almost 4,000 likes. One fan wrote: 'I love both of them. They done lots of good thing for the world. One of them still survived in life, strongly supported by her significant others, and could make the other person really proud for having daughter in law like her.' Another added: 'Megan was rocking her outfit! She is beautiful!'. And a third said: 'Ohhh right homage to Di!', while another added: 'Love Diana and Meghan. Beautiful women!'. Meghan's elegant, long-sleeved dress is thought to be a bespoke creation by Wickstead, a favourite of both Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge, 38. The fitted long-sleeved dress falls a few inches below the knee and features cleverly-placed darts on the torso and waistline that serve to flatter the Duchess's svelte frame. She introduced a contrasting texture with a Â£1,695 'Demi' satin green bag by socialite designer Gabriel Hearst, worn on previous occasions, and finished the look with a pair of nude heels by favourite footwear designer Aquazzura. When it came to jewellery, Meghan chose her beautiful diamond trio engagement ring and her trusty pair of Â£6,950 Stowstorm earrings by Canadian designer Birks. Prince Harry was particularly close to his mother, and in recent years has spoken about how her death affected him. Last May, Harry and Meghan included a touching tribute to the late Princess Diana in their announcement confirming they welcomed baby Archie to the world. A statement released by the Palace revealed that, in line with royal protocol, the Queen was among the first to be informed of the news. However - along with the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - Diana's siblings Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer were also notified of the news. This differs from the birth of Prince Louis in April 2018, when Prince William and Kate informed The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, along with 'members of both families'."
43,The tensions that marred Fab Four's final outing: Prince Harry and Meghan 'became emotional and upset' about being dropped from Queen's arrival party - forcing Prince William and Kate Middleton to step in to 'defuse' situation,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093269/Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-join-Harry-Meghan-minute-Westminster-Abbey.html,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussexâ€™s last engagement as senior royals was marred by behind-the-scenes tensions over protocol. It had been agreed that Harry and Meghanâ€™s attendance at yesterdayâ€™s Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey with other senior royals would be a fitting farewell. But the Daily Mail understands the couple were upset to learn that they would not be permitted to join the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the main VIP party. Instead they were told they would have to make their own way to their seats at the front of the abbey before the arrival of other senior royals, alongside the Earl and the Countess of Wessex. Fearing another highly public royal skirmish, William and Kate, it can be revealed, stepped in to defuse the situation at the weekend and offered to join â€˜emotionalâ€™ Harry and Meghan as they waited in their seats for the Queen, Charles and Camilla to arrive. But not before 2,000 orders of service had been signed off and printed which very clearly â€“ and rather embarrassingly â€“ placed the Cambridges firmly as entering with the main royal party. And it seems that their 11th-hour olive branch did not ease the ill-feeling between the feuding family. As the Cambridges arrived to take their seats, the duchess, 38, in a favourite red Catherine Walker coat and a matching hat, appeared to blank Harry and Meghan, while the two brothers exchanged only the most awkward of hellos. Although Harry greeted his brother William with a smile, there was little interaction between them. Meghan, 38, dressed in an eye-catching emerald green Emelia Wickstead dress with a hat by William Chambers, bag by Gabriela Hearst and Aquazzura heels, was seen to say â€˜hiâ€™ and then â€˜helloâ€™ to William when he didnâ€™t appear to see her the first time, with a somewhat rictus grin on her face. The prince, 37, did greet her with a smile and a quick hello on the second occasion, however. It was not clear whether any further exchanges took place off camera. Throughout yesterdayâ€™s service â€“ one of the highlights of the Queenâ€™s calendar â€“ Harry, 35, appeared pensive and ill at ease. He and Meghan, who determinedly gave a mega-watt smile throughout, chatted animatedly with his uncle Prince Edward, who was seated on the same row. Camilla, 72, elegant in navy, appeared to try to ease matters when she and Charles arrived, turning to smile warmly and greet Harry and Meghan, who were on the row behind her. Meghan was seen to curtsey for both the Queen and the Prince of Wales when they took their seats. The Sussexes clasped hands as they departed â€“ in the same manner as they arrived â€“ and could even be seen clutching each other in their official car as they sped away after the service to embark on their new life in North America. Buckingham Palace last night attempted to put on a brave face, insisting there was â€˜no set format for this annual serviceâ€™ as it â€˜depended on how many Members of the Royal Family are in attendanceâ€™. The Queen and senior royals are always the last to arrive and take part in a procession down to the front of the Abbey. But the palace notably failed to address the issue of why the Cambridges were originally down in the official Order of Service to accompany the Queen, before changing their minds to take their seats ahead of the Queenâ€™s arrival, alongside the Sussexes. An aide said: â€˜The Wessexes, Sussexes and Cambridges are all processing straight to their seats. The Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and The Queen are in the procession. â€˜Itâ€™s not unusual for Members of the Royal Family to be travelling in Commonwealth countries during Commonwealth week. There is no further comment.â€™ The decision not to include the Sussexes was made by the Queenâ€™s office directly, led by her private secretary Edward Young. Harry and Meghan were understood to be particularly hurt as although it was to be their last public engagement, they will not formally step down until March 31. Until then Harry still retains the title, given to him by the Queen, of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador â€“ of which he has been stripped along with his other official duties, as part of his royal stand-down. He and Meghan will also retain strong links with the â€˜family of nationsâ€™ because they will keep their roles as president and vice-president of the Queenâ€™s Commonwealth Trust. The duchess will also retain her patronage of the Association of Commonwealth Universities which she took on last year. â€˜It seems that they were quite sensitive and emotional about it,â€™ said one royal source. Another insider added: â€˜Although they are adamant about wanting to step down, they seem quite preoccupied with what status they will retain and the fact that Harry remains sixth in line to the throne, as they made a point of saying on their new website the other day.â€™ Last year the couple â€“ Meghan pregnant with their now ten-month-old son Archie â€“ took pride of place alongside the Queen and the other senior royals at the service, both in line with their status and their specific Commonwealth roles. The monarch, who is Head of the Commonwealth and sees its stewardship as one of the greatest successes of her reign, personally asked them to be her flag bearers as she believed they would connect well with its young people. The Commonwealthâ€™s 54 member countries have a combined population of more than two billion, of which more than 60 per cent are under 30 years of age. As for the Sussexes, it is understood their office plans to make a number of announcements about their future lives in the coming weeks but they have no official engagements scheduled in between now and March 31, when they officially step down. The coupleâ€™s Buckingham Palace office will officially close on April 1, with all 15 members of their staff, as previously revealed by the Mail, losing their jobs as Harry and Meghan pursue their independence â€“ and commercial careers â€“ abroad. 'Not exactly the warm reunion we were hoping for': Body language expert Judi James says Harry's 'tension was palpable' as William fails to respond to his brother's 'weak, mouth-closed smile' By AMIE GORDON for MailOnline Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were today reunited with Prince Williamand Kate for the first time in four months - in what one body language expert described as 'not exactly the warm reunion we were hoping for'. The Sussexes and Cambridges came together, at the Queen's Commonwealth Service in Westminster Abbey, for the first time since they paid their respects at a Remembrance Day service in November. It is also the lasttime they will all be together before Harry and Meghan bow out of royal duties and embrace their new life in North America. Meghan was seen to mouth 'hi' and give a small wave to William and Kate, followed by a 'hello', as the Cambridges took their seat in the High Altar in the row in front of the Sussexes.Harry also said 'hello' and smiled at his brother, who seemed to ignore him. But according to body language expert Judi James, Harry's 'tension was palpable' as William seemingly failed to greet his brother. 'TENSE' HARRY DISPLAYED SELF-COMFORTING GESTURES 'It wasn't the warm reunion that we were all hoping for,' said Ms James. 'The tension in Harry's body language especially was palpable.When Harry arrived, the minute he and Meghan had to drop hands, he immediately reached for his wedding ring which is a self comfort. 'Even when she was beside him after they had stopped holding hands, he was missing her, needing her support.' She added: 'As Harry walked up the aisle, they both waved at the children, but his face otherwise was quite tense and unsmiling. AN 'AWKWARD' SIBLING REUNION The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had walked in ahead of Prince William and Kate Middleton before Prince Charles and Camilla also arrived, and the Queen then made an entrance to trumpet fanfare and cheers from crowds outside. Ms James claims the siblings appeared 'awkward' - with William seemingly failing to greet his younger brother. While Prince Edward partly rose to greet the Cambridges, Sophie and the Sussexes remained seated. 'Harry and Meghan looked a lot more genuinely cheerful, and Harry especially, through a really affectionate smile at Kate,' Ms James told PA news agency. 'As they took their seats Harry threw Kate an open-mouthed smile and ""hello"" of what looked like genuine pleasure and Meghan raised her brows and smiled in an equally friendly ritual. 'But when it was William, you could see Harry was slightly more rigid and his lips were closed.' HARRY 'RELAXED' WHEN WILLIAM AND OTHER ROYALS LEFT Once William and Kate had driven away, Ms James said we saw 'a different Harry altogether'. Ms James said the tension appeared to grow in Harry's signals after William took his seat in front of him. 'While Meghan curtsied and flashed a friendly, warm smile of greeting to Charles and the Queen, Harry appeared to be fiddling with his programme and later he appeared to be tapping his programme on his knee during the actual service,' she claimed. 'His facial expression looked distant and his accelerated blinking even suggested he might have been fighting back tears sitting behind the backs of the heads of all the family members he would be saying goodbye to. 'Harry's jacket-pulling gesture of tension increased once the service was over and he stood behind the Cambridge's to say goodbye to his hosts. 'With the other royals gone Harry and Meghan became an animated, tactile double-act again, with Harry chatting to Craig David as though he was an old friend and Meghan even leaning forward to touch Anthony Joshua on the arm to congratulate him for his speech,' she claimed. 'Harry suddenly looked like a man reluctant to leave a party, throwing a thumbs up gesture to Joshua over his shoulder while Meghan touched Harryâ€™s arm in what looked like a gesture of affection and steering. 'Laughing and joking with the people outside, Harry's relief looked so tangible that his sudden eyes to heaven and raised hands looked awfully like a signal of thanks. 'He became animated and far more relaxed and holding Meghan's hand again he looked like a man who felt he's got the most difficult moments over and who could now return to being ""Just Harry"" again with his wife and son.' Last year, Harry and Meghan waited alongside William, Kate, Charles and Camilla for the Queen to arrive, before taking part in 'The Procession of The Queen'. This year, however, neither couple took part in the procession and simply made their way to their seats after greeting dignitaries. From March 31, the monarch's grandson and American former actress Meghan will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue a new life of personal and financial freedom, mostly in North America. "
44,REVEALED: Bondsmen are refusing to help 'cult' mom Lori Vallow post $1million bail ahead of her trial on charges over her missing kids,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095613/Bondsmen-refusing-help-cult-mom-Lori-Vallow-post-1million-bail-ahead-missing-kids-trial.html,"'Cult' mom Lori Vallow remains behind bars in an Idaho jail after two local bond companies have reportedly refused to help her post $1million bail. Lori, who faces charges of neglect and desertion for the disappearance of her children Joshua 'JJ' Vallow and Tylee Ryan, was booked into Madison County Jail in Rexburg last Thursday after being extradited from Hawaii. A judge reduced Lori's bail from $5million to $1million on Friday. She is required to put up 10 percent of that amount - $100,000 - to be released. But four days later she is still in custody as two local bond companies tell the East Idaho News they were contacted by Lori's representatives but declined to work with her. The businesses did not say why they declined, but the outlet speculated they are worried about being stiffed with the full $1million bail if Lori fails to appear in court. Prosecutors have indicated that Lori's husband Chad Daybell has more than enough money to post 10 percent of the bail. In court documents they wrote that Chad received $430,000 from his previous wife's life insurance policy after she died in October. The documents also cited one of his bank accounts which had a balance of $152,000 at the time of her arrest last month. Should Lori manage to post bail, she will be required to wear a GPS monitor, sign a waiver of extradition and will be restricted to Fremont, Madison, Jefferson and Bonneville counties. Madison County authorities say they are confident they can keep track of the defendant if she is released and are prepared to do so as soon as she posts bail. 'We have the paperwork ready, but so far, nothing has happened,' Sheriff Sgt Isaac Payne told the East Idaho News. 'We have done our due diligence as far as getting an ankle monitor, and we are ready if she does find a bondsman.' In the meantime, Lori is being held in a smaller segregated portion of the jail but is not in isolation, Payne said. She is allowed to meet with her attorneys and clergy members in person but must conduct all other visits through a video chat system. Lori's children, seven-year-old JJ and 17-year-old Tylee, were last seen in Idaho in September but were never reported missing by their mother or the man she married weeks later, prolific doomsday author Chad Daybell. The couple fled Idaho for Hawaii in late November, hours after police began asking questions about the children's whereabouts. Authorities tracked them down in the Kauai town of Princeville on January 25 and served Lori with a court order requiring her to physically produce the children to authorities in Idaho within five days. She failed to meet the deadline, prompting her arrest on February 20. An Idaho warrant charged her with two counts of felony child desertion and nonsupport of children, as well as three misdemeanor counts of resisting and obstructing an officer, solicitation of a crime and contempt of court. Lori was held in a Kauai jail on $5million bond until being extradited to Rexburg on March 4. At a hearing two days later, Lori's attorneys asked that her bond be reduced to $50,000, saying she was presumed innocent and did not deserve to have her case tried in the media. 'This is a violation of Lori's constitutional rights,' her lawyer said.  Prosecutors responded by saying the bond was set so high because Lori is a flight risk. 'This case didn't start as a criminal case - it started as a report of two missing children who are still missing,' [one of the prosecutors said], adding Lori fled 'very quickly' after police began asking questions about the children's whereabouts in November. They also noted that Lori's husband Chad received funds from his wife's life insurance policy - around $430,000 - which gives the couple means to flee. He added that Lori has relocated four times since last August, there are three active investigations into suspicious deaths that she has been linked to, and that she left every home she's had in the last few months in suspicious circumstances. The judge ultimately agreed to reduce bail to $1million. Lori is next scheduled to appear in Madison County Magistrate Court for a preliminary hearing on March 18, where prosecutors will need to prove there is enough evidence to support the felony charges her before the case can proceed to District Court. Authorities began searching for JJ and Tylee in late November after performing a welfare check ordered by concerned relatives who said they hadn't spoken to JJ, who is autistic, in months. When officers first went to Lori's home in Idaho on November 26, she told them that JJ was visiting relatives in Arizona - which investigators say was a lie. Officers returned the following day and found that Lori and Chad had fled from the home. The couple were named persons of interest in the children's disappearance in mid-December. Rexburg police have accused Lori of repeatedly lying about where JJ and Tylee are and refusing to cooperate with investigators conducting a multi-state search. They've said they 'strongly believe that Joshua and Tylee's lives are in danger' and that Lori knows what happened to the kids. Lori and Chad issued a statement after they went on the run insisting that they'd done nothing wrong. It has since emerged they had told people Tylee was dead and that Lori has no minor children. JJ was last seen at his elementary school in Rexburg on September 23, a day before his mother withdrew him and told administrators she would be homeschooling him. Doorbell camera footage recorded at a neighbor's house appeared to show JJ playing in his front yard on September 17. Tylee was last seen on September 8 at Yellowstone National Park on a day trip with her mother, uncle and JJ. Police recovered a photo of Tylee in the park from Lori's iCloud account and said there's been no sign of the 17-year-old since.

Detectives are reportedly preparing to search Yellowstone as soon as the snow melts, which could not happen until May or June. The search for JJ and Tylee captured nationwide attention with the revelations that police are also investigating three mysterious deaths linked to Lori and Chad, as well as family members' claims that the couple are members of a dangerous doomsday cult. The first death is that of Lori's estranged husband Charles Vallow, who was shot dead by her brother Alex Cox in Arizona on July 10. Charles and Lori had gotten into an argument when the father came to pick up JJ at the mother's home in Chandler. Lori's brother intervened and fatally shot Charles. Police initially determined that he acted in self defense - but the case was reopened amid the multi-state search for JJ and Tylee, who had moved to Idaho, where Chad lived, with their mother in August. The second mysterious death was Tammy Daybell - Chad's previous wife - who was found dead at the couple's home in Salem, Idaho, on October 19. An obituary stated that Tammy passed away in her sleep and her cause of death was ruled as natural after Chad reportedly declined an autopsy. Investigators reopened the case after learning that JJ and Tylee were missing, as their mother had married Chad just two weeks after Tammy died. They believe the two cases could be linked. Tammy's body was exhumed on December 11 and the autopsy results have not yet been released. On December 12, Lori's brother, Alex Cox, was found dead in Gilbert, Arizona.  The 51-year-old's death is now under investigation as police wait for an autopsy to determine the cause. A troubling portrait of Lori and Chad has emerged from accounts from family members who claim the couple are members of a dangerous cult obsessed with the end of the world. Kay Woodcock - the sister of Charles Vallow who is also JJ's grandmother - issued a statement in December in which she described how Lori turned into a 'monster' after she met Chad in 2017. Chad, 51, is a prolific author of 25 books focusing on doomsday scenarios and near-death experiences. He is what's known as a 'prepper' - someone who is getting ready for the End of Times - and was a member of a group called Preparing a People. Late last year DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Chad had been kicked out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints months earlier after he declared himself a prophet. Lori reportedly began reading Chad's writing while she was living in Hawaii with Charles, JJ and Tylee between 2014 and 2017. It's unclear how or when exactly Lori and Chad met, but family members say it was sometime around June 2017. The pair made their first appearance together in December 2018 on a podcast for Preparing a People. Lori and Charles' marriage deteriorated rapidly as she became more and more involved with Preparing a People, and he filed for divorce and for custody of JJ in February 2019. In court documents, Charles claimed that Lori had recently become 'infatuated, at times obsessive, about near death experiences and spiritual visions'.  'Mother [Lori] has told Father [Charles] that she is sealed [eternally married] to the ancient Book of Mormon prophet Moroni and that she has lived numerous lives on numerous planets prior to this current life,' the documents state. 'Mother also informed Father that she is a translated being who cannot taste death sent by God to lead the 144,000 into the Millennium. 'Mother believes that she is receiving spiritual revelations and visions to help her gather and prepare those chosen to live in the New Jerusalem after the Great War as prophesied in the book of Revelations.' Charles also claimed in the petition that Lori had threatened to kill him if he got in the way of her mission. "
45,"Millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst 'used his dog's name Igor as a code word when talking about plans to KILL his younger brother', prosecutor tells jury",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094523/Robert-Durst-used-dogs-code-word-threaten-kill-younger-brother-Douglas.html,"Robert Durst, the millionaire real estate heir on trial in Los Angeles for the fatal shooting of his close friend Susan Berman, used his dogâ€™s name as a code word for murder when talking about plans to kill his brother, prosecutors said. The jury in the case heard tapes of a phone call between Durst and his second wife, Debrah Lee Charatan, in which he talks of â€˜Igoringâ€™ his younger brother, Douglas Durst, who heads the familyâ€™s New York real estate empire. â€˜I suspect [Douglas] doesnâ€™t even suspect now [that he is a target],â€™ Durst is heard in the tape saying. At the time of the recording, Durst was in a Pennsylvania prison after he jumped bail in Galveston, Texas, where he was arrested for allegedly killing his neighbor. He was arrested in Pennsylvania for trying to shoplift a sandwich at a supermarket, even though he had thousands of dollars in cash in his car, according to Bloomberg News. John Lewin, the Los Angeles deputy district attorney, told jurors that he believed Durst planned to kill his brother after their father, Seymour Durst, placed Douglas in charge of the multi-billion dollar Durst Organization. The companyâ€™s holdings include a stake in One World Trade Center as well as other valuable properties throughout New York City. In 2006, Robert Durst accepted a $65million payout from the family in exchange for relinquishing all claims to the family trust. Robert Durst is on trial for the 2000 murder of Susan Berman, his close friend who was found shot to death in her Los Angeles home on Christmas Eve. She was killed just days before she was to give an interview to New York investigators looking into the 1982 disappearance of Kathie Durst, Robert Durstâ€™s first wife. Her body has never been found. Prosecutors also say that Robert Durst killed his neighbor in Texas, Morris Black. Durst, who claimed he killed Black in self-defense, was acquitted in that case. Durst has denied all accusations against him. â€˜Igorâ€™ is the name of Robert Durstâ€™s dog, according to an interview Douglas Durst gave to The New York Times in 2015. Igor is also the name of the dog that was killed in All Good Things, a 2010 film in which Ryan Gosling plays a fictionalized version of Robert Durst. According to Douglas Durst, when his younger brother was married to his first wife, Kathie Durst, he kept several dogs. â€˜Before the disappearance of my sister-in-law, Bob had a series of Alaskan Malamutes, which is like a husky,â€™ Douglas Durst said. â€˜He had seven of them, and they all died, mysteriously, of different things, within six months of his owning them. All of them named Igor. â€˜We donâ€™t know how they died, and what happened to their bodies. â€˜In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing his wife with those dogs.â€™ Douglas Durst was convinced that his brother was killing dogs after hearing a jailhouse conversation between Robert Durst and his second wife - presumably the same one that was played in court in Los Angeles on Monday. â€˜When he was in jail in Pennsylvania, he was recorded saying, â€œI want to Igor Douglasâ€,â€™ Douglas Durst told the Times. All Good Things was directed by Andrew Jarecki, a filmmaker who spent years researching the Durst story. It was Jareckiâ€™s 2015 Emmy-winning documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, which led to the real estate heirâ€™s arrest. In the dramatic finale, Robert Durst is caught on a hot mic appearing to confess to the killings of his wife, Berman, and Black. â€˜What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course,â€™ Durst said in the documentary. In the audio commentary for the DVD of All Good Things, Durst tells Jarecki that he did not like the depiction of him as enjoying the murder of his dog, Igor. â€˜This made me feel bad about the movie, Andrew,â€™ Durst is heard saying in the clip. â€˜I mean the idea that I could kill Igor, I donâ€™t like.â€™ In court on Monday, Lewin told jurors that Jarecki gained Durstâ€™s trust by bonding over their shared love of dogs, according to BuzzFeed News. In the interview with Jarecki, Durst said he was not sorry about killing Black during a confrontation. But Durst also declined to answer when pressed by Jarecki as to why he didnâ€™t help police search for his missing wife, Kathie. Durst then corrected Jarecki about his dogs. He told the filmmaker that he did not have a â€˜bunch ofâ€™ dogs named Igor, as his brother, Douglas, claimed. â€˜No, we had two Igors before the Igor that lasted forever,â€™ Durst says in the interview. â€˜One of them got run over and one of them, when he was a puppy, went out and the second one ate an apple core. â€˜The apple core got stuck in his gut. â€˜We took him and had an operation done on him and he died.â€™ In court on Monday, Lewin did not say if he believed that Durst really killed his dogs, though he said he would prove that Durst is guilty of killing Susan Berman.  Lewin played the jury a videotape of himself and Los Angeles Police Department detectives interviewing the multi-millionaire in 2015, where Lewin says Durst made a tacit but startling admission: that he was a murderer. In the interview, Lewin asks Durst: 'When you killed Susan, that was not something you wanted to do. Do you want to know how I know that? Durst replied: 'I'm going to stay away from killing Susan.' Lewin seized on the response, telling the jury that when given an opportunity, Durst failed to deny the killings. He added that Durst hinted he had details about the crime that only the killer would know. 'At the end of the interview,' Lewin said, 'Durst in essence confessed to Kathie and Susan's murders by admitting that he had details that he had not yet provided.' The lead prosecutor played the jury a clip from the interview, where investigators asked Durst for the location of his late wife's remains. 'You'd like some details from me if I knew about where Kathie's body is and about what happened to Susan,' Durst told the investigators. 'I'm not about to go that far. I think what you wanted to hear was ''what did you do with Kathie'',' he said. 'I think you want me to go through the details with Susan. 'By telling you those things, of being guilty. By pleading guilty I'm going to be going back to Los Angeles, California, and doing my time.' After playing the excerpts from the interview, Lewin told the jury: 'Bob Durst was admitting that he had the answers to those questions, answers he could only have if in fact he was the killer.' The LA prosecutor also showed the jury handwriting samples that experts have concluded belong to Durst, linking him to a note mailed to police in 2000 with the word 'cadaver' and Berman's address. Lewin showed that Durst had written the same address on an envelope he had previously sent to Berman containing a $25,000 check, printed with his name and address on the top left corner. The envelope was recovered from the crime scene after Berman's body was discovered, and Lewin told the jury it later became a highly significant piece of evidence. '2014 LAPD retained world renowned forensic document examiners Lloyd Cunningham and Linton Mohammed to compare Durst's handwriting to the cadaver note and envelope,' the prosecutor said. 'They concluded that Bob Durst wrote the cadaver note.' Lewin played the jury a section of his 2015 interview with the real estate heir, where he brought up the incriminating note. In the videotaped interview, the investigators put it to Durst that 'Whoever wrote the note was a part of killing her.' Durst replied in agreement: 'Whoever wrote that note had to be involved in Susan's death.' Lewin told the jury that the statement, coupled with the alleged handwriting match, was tantamount to an admission to Berman's murder. The 79-year-old real estate heir from Scarsdale, New York, has been held in LA County Jail for the trial. He reportedly suffers from hydrocephalus and in 2013 underwent spinal surgery, had a stent put into his skull and had a cancerous mass removed from his esophagus. The alleged triple-murderer appeared frail in court, walking unsteadily in a grey suit jacket, white shirt, cream pants and white, velcro sneakers. Throughout Lewin's monologue to the court on Monday, Durst stared straight ahead. The alleged killer is the son of billionaire real estate mogul Seymour Durst. The Durst Organization, founded by Robert's grandfather Joseph in 1927, owns or manages New York properties said to be worth $4.4billion. The trial, which is expected to last five months, began last week with two days of opening statements from the prosecution which carried into Monday, with Durst's defense yet to have their turn addressing the jury. Prosecutors told the court last week that Durst murdered three people â€“ his first wife Kathleen McCormack Durst, his longtime friend Susan Berman who helped him construct a 'false alibi' for the disappearance of his wife, and a neighbor who discovered his true identity after he went into hiding. Jurors at the Los Angeles trial heard last week that the alleged triple-murderer had a 'hit list' of people he wanted to kill, including his younger brother, Douglas, who was chosen over the real estate heir to assume control of the family's New York-based property empire. Lewin said that evidence in Durst's murder trial will 'clearly and without any doubt' prove that Bob Durst killed his wife Kathy Durst.' The year his wife went missing in 1982, the couple were headed for divorce, and Durst himself confessed in videotaped interviews to 'pushing, shoving and slapping' Kathy. Lewin told the jury that the real estate heir killed his medical staffer wife because she 'wanted a fair settlement and she wasn't going to leave the marriage till she got it.' Kathleen was due to start a new job at a clinic in the Bronx, New York, on February 1, 1982. Durst told police that he had a sandwich with his wife in South Salem the evening before, then drove her to the station and put her on a train for New York City. But, said Lewin, 'There is no evidence that she ever got on that train.' After taking four days to report his wife missing, Lewin said that Durst told police: 'whatever happened to Kathy was the result of her drug use, promiscuity and criminal companions.' He recruited his old friend, Susan Berman, as a 'spokesperson'. She told detectives Kathleen's disappearance was 'something to do with drugs, and she spent $1,000 a week on drugs.' Lewin told the jury that in fact the medical student 'didn't have $1,000 a week to spend on drugs' and was focused on her career. The lead prosecutor said Berman's help even extended to providing a 'false alibi' for Durst, posing as Kathleen in a phone call to her medical school after her disappearance. As the 29-year-old's body was never found, prosecutors said Durst believed he got away with her murder â€“ until the reopening of her case by New York authorities in 2000 sent him into a panic. In a recording played to the jury of Durst recalling the period, the alleged killer said 'I've been guilty for years in the newspapers â€¦ now they really are going to find me guilty.' Lewin said Berman's fate was sealed when she called Durst to tell him police had contacted her about his wife's vanishing. 'What am I going to say, no?' Durst told the HBO documentary, The Jinx. 'That statement sealed Susan's fate' said Lewin who added that Durst 'decided to kill her because he knew that she was not the best at keeping secrets.' The trial continues."
46,"REVEALED: Boy, 12, was 'hosed down like an animal by grandmother and aunt before evil relatives - including his 14-year-old uncle - took turns beating him to death'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093637/Boy-12-forced-sit-half-naked-sprayed-hose-family-beat-death.html,"Newly released texts reveal the horrifying treatment a 12-year-old Montana boy received from relatives before he was beaten to death on the living room floor last month. James 'Alex' Hurley, died February 3 and his grandparents, 47-year-old James Sasser Jr. and 48-year-old Patricia Batts, as well as his 14-year-old uncle James Sasser III are charged with deliberate homicide.  Hurley's 18-year-old aunt, Madison Sasser, texted her boyfriend that the child should'go die in the woods' and described him as 'a piece of (crap) off of my f**king shoe', the Billings Gazette reports. Sasser and Hurley's six-year-old uncle lived with the relatives who allegedlyphysically abused and starved the child. According to documents, Hurley was made to sit half-naked in front of fans and was sprayed with water. Batts is said to have commented, 'thatâ€™s what they do with cats, right?' The grandmother told detectives Hurley 'drove her nuts' and had become 'increasingly problematic' since his father died about two years ago following an ATV accident that left him paralyzed. Batts said he was stealing from stores, his own family and was drinking alcohol. The accused people claim he was self-harming and described his behavior as 'erratic'. The child's mother told detectives she had tried to get in contact with him but the family stopped her. Batts claimed she pulled him out of school because he got in trouble for groping a girl. She admitted she made the child do jumping jacks and 'wall sits' if he didn't do his schoolwork. West Yellowstone school superintendent Kevin Flanagan told a detective that he was not aware of any groping incident. The grandmother was also questioned about where the child's 14-year-old uncle - who is accused of homicide - learned to discipline. Batts replied: 'I guess me.' Batts said she knew he had 'popped' Hurley with a paddle.They said that the uncle had made a paddle out of wood and he and Batts would use it to punish the young boy, according to court documents. Batts allegedly admitted to allowing Sasser III to punish Hurley when she wasn't home. She told authorities she doesn't know how her grandson died and doesn't feel responsible for his death. Footage reportedly showed the grandparents and Sasser III 'hitting him with a wooden paddle, strangling him and locking up food.' In some of the footage, Batts is seen strangling and hitting the boy, prosecutors said. James Sasser III reportedly admitted to kicking Hurley's head several times in the 24 to 36 hours before his death. Hurley died from head trauma after Sasser III, who is six-feet-tall and weighs 300 pounds, allegedly got into a 'bad fight' with the boy. The suspect reportedly claims he found Hurley standing over his grandmother with a knife. Batts reportedly said Hurley slept on the floor in the living room on February 2 and was mumbling and moaning throughout the night before she found him dead the next morning. Nobody sought medical help for the victim. The autopsy found the Hurley had bruising all over his body and died from trauma to the head. Sasser IIIappeared via video Thursday in Gallatin County District Court and pleaded not guilty to beating his 12-year-old nephew to death.  The grandparents said they documented the boy's actions on video in order to prove he needed help to behavioral specialists.   Batts was specifically charged with criminal child endangerment, aggravated kidnapping and strangulation of a partner or family member. She could get the death penalty if convicted. They both appeared in court last month where bail was set at $500,000 for Sasser Jr. and $750,000 for Batts. Family acquaintance Gage Roush, 18, was alsoarrested last month and charged with felony assault on a minor in relation to Hurley's death. The family have reportedly admitted to physically abusing the boy, but claim the boy was problematic and violent. The videos were reportedly evidence for when they took him to 'get help' from mental health officials. The accused told detectives that Hurley had tried to hurt himself and others on several occasions and he had complained of hearing voices telling him to kill people. Additionally, a neighbor said Batts, Sasser III and an unnamed 18-year-old aunt beat Hurley after he tried to run away in December, documents said. The victim and his uncle allegedly fought often but a fight on January 27 was 'worse'. Detectives said Batts described the fight after Sasser III allegedly saw Hurley with a knife as a 'blood bath'. Sasser Jr. told investigators that he considered Batts' punishments for Hurley egregious and he planned on divorcing his wife to raise the family's children alone. Batts, Sasser Jr. and Roush have not entered pleas yet."
47,'Smile though your heart is aching': Grieving Vanessa Bryant joins her three daughters in front of painted mural of late Kobe and Gianna and shares lyrics to Nat King Cole's poignant song,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8093715/Grieving-Vanessa-Bryant-joins-three-daughters-painted-mural-late-Kobe-Gianna.html,"Vanessa Bryant continues to remain a rock for her daughters. The 37-year-old widow of Kobe Bryant posed with daughters Natalia, 17, Bianka, three, and Capri, eight months, at the Los Angeles site of a mural painted of Kobe, 41, and daughter Gianna, 13. The pair were tragically killed in a January 26 helicopter crash in Calabasas, California with seven others. She added the lyrics of the Nat King Cole 1954 song smile, indicating her spirit amid a time of grief and sadness. The song was penned by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons in 1954, adapted from Charlie Chaplin's soundtrack for his 1936 film Modern Times. The lyrics for the song include: 'Smile though your heart is aching/ Smile even though it's breaking/ When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by/ If you smile through your fear and sorrow/ Smile and maybe tomorrow/ You'll see the sun come shining through for you. It continues: 'Light up your face with gladness/ Hide every trace of sadness/ Although a tear may be ever so near/ That's the time you must keep on trying/ Smile, what's the use of crying?/ You'll find that life is still worthwhile/ If you just smile.' On Sunday, Vanessa Bryant, shared a touching new photo of eldest daughter, Natalia posing in front of the mural of her father and sister. Shecaptioned the picture:'â¤ï¸my babies. Natalia. #winterformal.' Turns out mother and daughter were on the way to Natalia's high school winter formal dance in Los Angeles when they decided to stop and pose for the snap. Decked out in a cute blue and white patterned dress, the 17-year-old flashed a big proud smile as she stood in front of the painted mural. It shows her dad giving Gianna a kiss on the top of her head with a golden halo above them. The mural is a version of a famous photo of the pair as they sat courtside at an NBA game in November 2019, just two months before they passed away. This appears to be the first time Natalia has been pictured since attending the public memorial for Kobe and Gianna at Staples Center, where the Lakers call home. During the emotional event, Vanessa Bryant gave a heartfelt speech as the tears flowed down throughout the arena. 'God knew they couldn't be on this Earth without each other.He had to bring them home to heaven together,' she said with raw and real emotion. 'Kobe, take care of our Gigi. I've got Natalia, Bianka and Capri. We're still the best team.' The Bryants were married for nearly 19 years at the time of Kobe's death on January 26."

The cause of death was revealed after a two-month investigation by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Harry diedon January 7 at the age of27 after battling addiction and mental health problems. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with effects similar to heroin that is used for relieving severe pain. The coroner's report listed Harry's place of death as 'hospital' and the manner of his death as an 'accident'. Harry's mother, Hollywood actress Jane Badler, announced her son's death on Instagram two months ago. 'On Jan 7 my beautiful son died. He was 27 and had the world at his feet,' she wrote. 'But sadly he struggled with mental illness and addiction. A brilliant spark shone bright too short a time... I will miss you, Harry, every day of my life.' Jane did not disclose her son's cause of death at the time. A funeral service was held at theHollywood Forever cemetery in Los Angeles on January 12. Harry shared his last Instagram post - a celebratory New Year's Eve photo with a female friend - just days before his death. He wrote in the caption: 'To 2020! The new era has already begun. So let's all keep only moving forward, staying so present to enjoy each and every moment throughout this beautiful new beginning. 'Happy New Year, peeps. So much love and gratitude for all in my life.' Harry was best known for playing a victim of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in a2015 episode of American Horror Story: Hotel. He also appeared in three episodes of The Deleted, in whichhe played a desk clerk. In 2018, Harry starred alongside Alexis Nichols in the film I, Matter about a college student in Los Angeles who contracts HIV. One of his last roles was in an episode ofThe OA titledAngel of Death. Harry wasraised inMelbourne and was studying pre-med when he decided to move to London to pursue modelling and acting. He later relocated to New York, before settling in Los Angeles. Harry was also a musician performing under the name ANTIBOY, an alter ego he described as a 'gender fluid robot from the future'. Harry identified asgender fluid, according to a March 2019 interview with Boys by Girlsmagazine. The article referred to Harry using 'he' and 'him' pronouns. 'I know that I am born male but I don't think I represent what it means to be a man,' he said at the time. 'I believe we should be whatever we want. It gets kind of confusing when we start labelling ourselves so I try to stay away from labels. 'I grew up in Melbourne and I had a very open and accepting family. Dating someone of either sex didn't make a difference to me.' He told the same publication that he'd suffered from a 'serious sleeping disorder' (idiopathic insomnia) as a child and had a tendency to be 'self-destructive'. Harry's mother, Jane Badler, who is known for her roles in Falcon Crest and science fiction series V, was born in New York City but settled in Australia after she married businessman Stephen Hains."
49,Traces of ancient Mars-sized wandering planet Theia that nearly destroyed Earth and formed the Moon 4.5 billion years ago are found in lunar rocks - proving the long-held 'giant impact' theory,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8095817/Astronomers-traces-ancient-planet-Theia-moon-rocks-proving-giant-impact-theory.html,"Traces of the ancient Mars-sized wandering planet Theia that nearly destroyed Earth and formed the Moon 4.5 billion years ago have been found in lunar rocks. This goes some way to proving a long-held theory that the Moon was formed out of material expelled after Theia collided with the Earth billions of years ago. Researchers from the University of New Mexico examined the oxygen isotopes in Moon rocks brought back to Earth by Apollo astronauts. They discovered the oxygen isotopes - an indicator of the origin of the material - were slightly different to those found in Earth rocks, suggesting they came from Theia. Scroll down for video The team haven't predicted exactly how the Moon formed or how the impact happened but say their findings can help others create a more detailed theory. About 4.5 billion years ago in the first 150 years of the Solar System the Earth was hit by a Mars-size planet. Leading theories suggest this led to the creation of the Moon and Theia may have merged with the Earth. Theia is named after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. The protoplanet may have come from the outer solar system before colliding with the very young Earth. Previous studies of the lunar rocks returned to Earth by Apollo astronauts found they were almost completely identical to those on Earth - but the New Mexico team found that wasn't the case. They examined samples of rocks gathered from a number of different lunar sites and with both high and low titanium basalts. They modified a standard isotope analysis technique in order to get a higher-than-usual precision measurement of the oxygen isotope. Previous studies averaged together the measurements of all the samples but the New Mexico team took a different approach and got surprising results. 'While the Earth rocks occupy a very narrow range of oxygen isotope compositions, the lunar samples demonstrated nearly three times that variability,' Erick Cano from the University of New Mexico told the New Scientist. 'Typically, all the lunar samples are lumped together as a whole and the average value of all the lunar samples measured in the study is taken as the value for the moon,' he said. 'We show that the method of averaging together lunar isotope data while ignoring lithological differences does not give an accurate picture of the differences between the Earth and Moon,' they wrote in their paper. The team found that the deeper into the Moon the samples were taken, the greater the difference between them and oxygen isotopes on Earth. They discovered that the distinct oxygen isotope composition on Theia was not completely lost through the impact with Earth, and lives on in the Moon. Lead author Erick Cano said: 'The research is important because it eliminates the need for giant-impact models that include a complete oxygen isotope homogenization between the Earth and the Moon. 'It provides a foundation for future modelling of the impact and lunar formation.' They say it could also suggest that Theia formed further out in the Solar System and then moved in before colliding with the Earth - rather than forming near the Earth. The giant impact theory is the most pervasive idea for explaining both the formation of the Earth and our relatively large moon compared to other rocky planets. The theory goes that about 4.45 billion years ago, 150 million years after the solar system formed, Earth was hit by a Mars-size object called Theia. Exactly how this happened is hotly debated, in part because of the previous studies suggested the oxygen isotopes on Earth and the Moon were nearly identical. The new research shows the two celestial bodies are not similar at all and become less similar the deeper into the Moon you go and the study authors say large parts of Theia could still be inside the core of the Moon. 'Since the giant impact hypothesis was formulated there have been various challenges doubting it,' Simon Kelley at the University of Edinburgh said. He toldNew Scientist:'These findings are different because they appear to support and validate it.' The research has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The theory suggests the moon is made up of debris left over following a collision between our planet and a body around 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon: Why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been chemically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact."
50,"Days were half an hour SHORTER during the Late Cretaceous period 70 million years ago before the Moon's gravity slowed down the Earth's rotation, ancient shell showsÂ ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8095233/Days-half-hour-SHORTER-70-million-years-ago-ancient-shell-shows.html,"Days were half an hour shorter during the Late Cretaceous period 70 million years ago, an analysis of growth rings in an ancient shell has shown. Earth at this time would thus have rotated around 372 times every year â€” rather than the current 366.25 rotations that gives us our 365-day year with leap years. The shell â€” of an extinct group of mollusc known as the rudist bivalves â€” had a rapid growth rate that allowed it to preserve a detailed record of the past. Researchers used lasers to sample tiny slices of the shell and count the daily growth rings far more accurately than was previously possible under a microscope. By looking at the growth patterns over time, the team were then able to determine the number of days in a year â€” refining our best guess from astronomical models. While the length of the year has remained constant across Earth's history, the number of days per year has grown as days have gotten longer. This is because the gravity of the Moon is slowing down the Earth's rotation thanks to the friction from ocean tides, which also causes the Moon to get further away. The researchers also found the first concrete evidence that rudist bivalves may have contained photosynthetic symbiotic organisms that helped them to grow. Scroll down for video The length of the year has remained constant across Earth's history. However, the number of days per year has grown as days have gotten longer. This is because the gravity of the Moon is slowing down the Earth's rotation thanks to the friction from ocean tides. This also causes the Moon to get further away â€” at around 1.5 inches every year, laser measurements reveal. However, the Moon cannot always have been retreating at this rate â€” else it would have been inside the Earth only 1.4 billion years ago. In contrast, experts think that the Moon was formed around 4.5 billion years ago. Studies like those of this ancient clam will help scientists work out how the Moon's retreat has changed over time. The fast growth rate of the mollusc â€” which belonged to the species Torreites sanchezi â€” and the new high-resolution scanning technique have allowed the researchers to study the conditions in which the shell grew in unprecedented detail. 'We have about four to five datapoints per day, and this is something that you almost never get in geological history,' said paper author and geochemistNiels de Winter of theVrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium. 'We can basically look at a day 70 million years ago. It's pretty amazing.' In contrast, normal climate reconstructions are confined to long-term changes that occur on the scale of tens of thousands of years. By shining lasers on the shell samples and cutting tiny holes a mere millionth of a metre across, the team were able to analyse trace elements in the material and gain insight into the chemistry and temperature of the ocean when the shell has formed. The specimen â€” which would have lived in a shallow, tropical seabed in what is now the Oman Mountains in theUnited Arab Emirates â€” grew its shell for more than nine years in total. The researchers found that the composition of the bivalve's shell changed more significantly over the course of individual days than it did with the seasons, or the regular cycles of the ocean tides. 'This bivalve had a very strong dependence on this daily cycle, which suggests that it had photosymbionts,' Dr de Winter explained. 'You have the day-night rhythm of the light being recorded in the shell.' Close examination of the individual layers revealed that the shell grew much faster during the day than it did at night. This suggests that rather than just filtering food from the water like modern oysters â€” a process that is not dependent on the time of the day â€”Torreites sanchezi likely harboured symbiotes that fed on sunlight, like modern giant clams. 'Until now, all published arguments for photosymbiosis in rudists have been essentially speculative,' saidpalaeobiologist Peter Skelton of the Open University, who was not involved in the present study. 'This paper is the first to provide convincing evidence in favour of the hypothesis.'  Chemical analysis of the mollusc shells also revealed that ocean temperatures were hotter in the Late Cretaceous period than had been previously thought. In the summer, water temperatures would have reached around 104Â°F (40Â°C) whereas, in winter, the oceans would have exceeded 86Â°F (30Â°). In contrast, modern tropical oceans see summer temperatures of in the order of 83Â°F (28Â°F) and winter temperatures of 81Â°F (27Â°C). According to Dr de Winter, the high ocean temperatures in the Late Cretaceous summers likely pushed molluscs to their limits of heat tolerance. With their initial study complete, the team hope to apply the same method to older fossils, allowing them to capture snapshots of days further back in time and improve our understanding of the evolution of the Earthâ€“Moon system. The full findings of the study were published in the journal Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology. Dr de Winter and colleagues studied the ancient shells of an species of mollusc â€” Torreites sanchezi â€” that belonged to an extinct group of molluscs known as rudist bivalves. Each individual rudist bivalve had two asymmetrical shells â€” or valves â€” that came together at a hinge and could be opened and closed by the creature. Rudists lived in waters that were around several degrees warmer than the average ocean temperatures of today, and would have grown together to form dense reefs, much like modern oysters. 'Rudists are quite special bivalves. There's nothing like it living today,' Dr de Winter explained. 'In the late Cretaceous especially, worldwide most of the reef builders were these bivalves.' 'So they really took on the ecosystem building role that the corals have nowadays.' Rudist bivalves died out in the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event which also saw the end of the non-avian dinosaurs."
51,LA shoppers are pictured lining up around the street in rush to buy emergency toilet paper and food amid coronavirus outbreak - as CDC issues 'stay home and stock up' warning,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095651/Panic-shoppers-line-store-parking-lots-waiting-stockpile-supplies-amid-coronavirus-fears.html,"People across the US have gone into a shopping frenzy, queuing up for stores to open and panic-buying large quantities of essential items over fears that the coronavirus outbreak could reach yet more dizzying heights. Shoppers were pictured lining up outside a Costco store in Burbank, California, on Monday morning, with a queue of people and their empty shopping karts snaking through the parking lot, waiting to rush in and emergency stockpile goods the second the doors opened. One eager customer, Jeffrey Schaefer, 45, said the line of shoppers continued all along the side of the huge wholesale store building, through the parking lot and back up the sidewalk. Hundreds of people were also seen queuing at a Los Angeles Costco branch on Sunday, as the person filming revealed that the store had limited water and toilet paper purchases to two packs per customer. Many shoppers weren't taking any risks, donning protective face masks as they stood in the queues. Shelves lie empty across the country as concerned families stock up on emergency supplies in anticipation of a potential lockdown situation similar to that seen across the whole of Italy over the weekend. Demand for hand sanitizer, disinfectant sprays and wipes and similar goods has especially increased as people desperately try to keep the deadly coronavirus at bay. Sales of hand sanitizer in the US rocketed 73% in the four weeks to February 22, according to Nielsen data, with analysts predicting this won't slow down 'for some time'. Several stores have turned to rationing the volume of certain products in efforts to spread the supply among community members. Costco stores were forced to tighten rationing rules further in the last week - reducing the number ofpackets of flour, sugar and rice each customer is allowed to buy from five to two per customer. Kroger too has placed limits on the number of sanitizers and cold and flu products shoppers can buy online. And grocery chain H-E-B entered the fray on Sunday, announcing a limit of four hand sanitizers, wipes or similar items per purchase. Stockpiling comes as fears continue to mount over the coronavirus outbreak, with the US death toll reaching 26 and counting on Monday and the number of people infected reaching at least 754. TheCenters for Disease Control issued new warnings on Monday for older and vulnerable people to stock up on enough medication and food to 'stay at home for a period of time'. The CDC issued the new advice, specifically aimed at those with serious underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and lung disease and the elderly. It recommendsstocking up on enough medication and food to 'stay at home for a period of time', though it does not state exactly how long. 'If a COVID-19 outbreak happens in your community, it could last for a long time,' advice posted on the CDC website says. 'Stay in touch with others by phone or email. You may need to ask for help from friends, family, neighbors, and community health workers if you become sick. 'Determine who can provide you with care if your caregiver gets sick.' As well as stocking up on essentials, the guidance, which comes following an early study of 70,000 Chinese coronavirus patients, also includesavoiding large crowds, cruise ships and airplanes and avoiding touching door handles, hand rails and elevator buttons in public places. If an outbreak starts in the local community, older and vulnerable people should stay at home as much as possible - particularly avoiding large crowds and poorly ventilated spaces. 'Consider ways of getting food brought to your house through family, social, or commercial networks,' the advice says. 'Our goal is to protect you,' Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. 'This will require you and your family to take action.' Though the advice is for the elderly and infirm, it will do little to quell fears among the general public and reduce the mass shopping sprees taking place up and down the country. For most healthy people, coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough and recovery is highly likely. For older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can become fatal. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials. Even so, US health authorities say it will likely be upwards of a year before a vaccine is actually ready."
52,Utah hospital installs purified air medical tents outside to screen patients for coronavirus without risking spread of deadly virusÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094887/Utah-hospital-installs-purified-air-medical-tents-outside-screen-patients-coronavirus.html,"A hospital in Utah has installed outdoor negative pressure tents so medics can screenfor coronavirus without risking spreading the deadly virus to patients inside. The medical tents, which were erected outside the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City last week, will be used in 'the event of an outbreak' and can hold anywhere between 25 and 50 patients each. There are currently two tents outside the hospital's emergency department, but health officials said they will 'put up more tents in the coming weeks' if it becomes necessary. The tents run separately to thehospital and are built to withstand 100 mph winds, Fox13Nowreported. The air inside them is cleaned through HEPA filters and is recirculated every 15 to 17 minutes per hour, with the hospital insisting the air 'does not go outside'. It comes as Governor Gary Herbert declared a state of emergency in Utah on Friday amid growing fears over the virus, which has killed 26 across the US. He said the 'number one focus is preparing for the arrival' of the deadly virus.The state since confirmed itsfirst case of COVID-19 on Saturday. Alongside installing outdoor tents with 'negative pressure systems', the University of Utah Hospital has also put in place new visitor policies amid growing fears over the virus. The tents contain specially designed HEPA filters which are 'constantly filtering and providing clean air' which 'does not go outside', the hospital said. 'Our negative pressure system takes an intake from the outside and it runs it through HEPA filters and it cleans the air inside and we recirculate that air every 15-17 minutes per hour,' the senior director of emergency management told 2News. 'The air is much more clean than if youâ€™re walking a regular building. The negative pressure is another way to just say purified air or clean air.' The half-domed tents were partitioned into small rooms, each ready to house a coronavirus patient. University of Utah Hospital executive director Alison Flynn Gaffney said: 'Having a consolidated place for them to come and not have a potential community outbreak scenario or increase those chances in a live ED, emergency department. 'This is all to protect, keep our staff and faculty and providers safe as well as all of our patients.' There are currently 754 coronavirus cases confirmed across the US, with 26 deaths reported as a result of the virus."
53,Seattle hospital offers drive-through coronavirus testing for its employees as Washington state's death toll reaches 22,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095349/Seattle-hospital-offers-drive-coronavirus-testing-employees.html,"A Seattle hospital has opened a drive-through clinic to test employees for coronavirus. The University of Washington Medical Center Northwest has converted the first floor of a parking garage into an infectious disease clinic with the capacity to see a new patient every five minutes. The patient will then typically get results within a day or so. For now the clinic is only available to the health care system's workers, who must go online and fill out a survey about their symptoms to get an appointment. It comes as The White House acknowledged the nation does not have enough coronavirus test kits as cases of the disease continue to rise in the US. Dr Seth Cohenwho runs the infectious disease clinic at UW Medical Center Northwest told NPR:'We want to make sure that if our staff test negative we get them back to work as soon as we can. 'But if they test positive we want to keep them out of the workforce to make sure they're not going on to infect other staff or patients.' Coronavirus has already caused at least 17 deaths in the Seattle area and infected at least 83 people. There are three medical tents on the first floor of the garage as well as signs and orange cones funneling vehicles to the testing site. When drivers first come in they are met by a nurse who asks them not to leave the vehicle. Everyone working there is dressed in full protective gear and face masks. Patients need to have a fever, dry cough, or other symptoms of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus - to be seen at the clinic. Two swabs are then taken through the open window, one from each nostril. The samples are then tested at a lab a few miles away. The medical center plans to extend in-car testing to first responders who may have been exposed. So far, the drive-through tests have found lots of flu and a few cases of coronavirus, Cohen says. Last week Vice-President Mike Pence said the Trump administration would not be able to meet its objective of delivering one million testing kits for that week. The Seattle-area nursing home at the epicenter of one of the biggest coronavirus outbreaks in the United States said on Monday it had no kits to test 65 employees showing symptoms of the respiratory illness that has killed at least 13 patients at the long-term care center. The staff in question, representing more than a third of the Life Care Center's 180 employees, are out sick with symptoms consistent with coronavirus, and a federal strike team of nurses and doctors is helping to care for 53 patients remaining in the center."
54,"How scrapping Tokyo Olympics over coronavirus fears would be felt around the world from billions 'wasted' on venues to financial woe for athletes, insurers, sponsors and TV networks",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094795/Tentacles-Olympic-cancellation-reach-globe.html,"With countries taking drastic measures to slow down the rapid spread of deadly coronavirus, questions have raged on about whether the 2020 Tokyo Olympics - expected to attract thousands- will go ahead as scheduled. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and local organisers say the games are set to go ahead from July 24 with 11,000 people - including athletes - expected at the Olympics and 4,400 at the Paralympics. Adding to this hotels, airlines and taxi drivers and 80,000 unpaid volunteers are all set to flock to Japan - where at least 530 people have been infected and 9 killed by coronavirus. Tokyo has officially spent Â£9.7billion ($12.6billion) to organise the Olympics while some speculate it could be double that.The games have only ever been cancelled in wartime since the modern Olympics began in 1896. J'den Cox, a two-time world champion wrestler and an Olympic bronze medalist in Rio de Janeiro, said: 'I've heard things about possibly the Olympics being canceled, and I think that would stink. 'It would probably break everybody's heart if that were to happen.' The Olympic brand could be damaged, although the Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee may be among the least affected parties financially if the games are called off. The IOC has been resolute in its message, although it has a several-month window to decide. Dr. Ali Khan. an epidemiologist and dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska said: 'Hard to imagine this will be defined by the end of May, but it could be. 'Regardless, numerous sick athletes could not lead to a very interesting games.' 'From what we know from numerous other mass-gathering events including sporting events, it is very easy to spread diseases worldwide from such events - from meningitis to Zika. 'Besides welcoming athletes and spectators with their tiny microbes, there is and may be ongoing disease in Japan.' Kazuhiro Tateda, an expert on infectious diseases and a member of a Japanese government panel, said the virus may not die out quickly. He said: 'Unlike the flu that disappears with warmer weather, the response to the new coronavirus, I think, will have to continue for half a year or a year. The IOC has ample financial safeguards against cancellation. Its latest annual report shows it has almost Â£1.5billion ($2billion) in reserve that could cover running costs until the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The IOC's annual reports show it paid almost Â£11.08million ($14.4million) in an insurance premium to protect against canceling the 2016 Rio Olympics and Â£9.85 million ($12.8 million) for a policy to cover the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. IOC President Thomas Bach was asked last week after an executive board meeting if the insurance premium has risen to as much as Â£15.39million ($20million) for a Tokyo policy. 'I don't know,' he replied. 'It wasn't discussed at this EB.' Wolfgang Maennig, an Olympic rowing gold medalist who teaches sports economics at Hamburg University, said the losses will be shared. He said: 'Insurance companies will have to pay a large amount of the losses of the IOC. 'The rest will have to be borne by the IOC.' The IOC controls the Olympics and has wide latitude to act. Its protection is spelled out in the 81-page Host City Contract, signed in 2013 with the city of Tokyo and the Japanese Olympic Committee. The preamble to the contact states: 'The Olympic Games are the exclusive property of the IOC which owns all rights ... to their organisation, staging, exploitation, broadcasting, recording, representation, reproduction ... whether now existing or developed in the future, throughout the world in perpetuity.' The contract also specifies that the IOC can terminate and withdraw from the city because of a 'state of war, civil disorder, or boycott ... or if the IOC has reasonable grounds to believe, in its sole discretion, that the safety of participants in the games would be seriously threatened or jeopardized for any reason whatsoever.' Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, said athletes are the most vulnerable. The Olympics feature 33 sports, and many of the smaller ones have a limited following until games time. Matheson added: 'For athletes, their career length isn't long and in many sports success in the Olympics is your one shot at a financial return.' Matheson said losses by hotels and other service businesses are unlikely to be insured. The billions on government spending on venues looks like a risky investment. The loss of the Olympics would negate the difficult-to-calculate goodwill that Japan and Tokyo might have won. An Irish bookmaker is showing odds leaning slightly toward the Olympics not going forward. Odds are 4-6 it will not open on July 24 in Tokyo, and even that it will. Tokyo is officially spending Â£9.7billion ($12.6billion) to organise the Olympics, although a national government audit office says it's at least twice that much. The local organising committee budget of Â£4.31billion ($5.6billion) is private money, with the rest coming from Japanese taxpayers. About Â£770,000 ($1billion) in the local operating budget is to come from ticket sales, which would be lost if the games go ahead without fans in empty stadiums. 'Some combination of the IOC, the broadcasters, and the insurers will lose big,' Matheson said. 'That loss is coming out of someone's pocket depending on how all of the contracts are written.' Andrew Zimbalist, who teaches economics at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, said some of the venues, such as the $1.43 billion national stadium, would have 'enduring value.' 'But virtually none of it would have made the list of the priority public investments,' he said in an email to the AP, adding that if the games were canceled, much of the investment would be 'wasted.' The IOC has said repeatedly the games will go on, and says it relies on advice from the World Health Organization. The WHO, the UN health agency, has so far resisted describing the crisis as a 'pandemic,' which could force the IOC's hand. But many experts say that threshold has already been met. More than 113,000 people have been infected worldwide from the virus, far more than those sickened by SARS, MERS or Ebola in recent years. More than 4,000 have died. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, the epicentre of the virus, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 63,000 so far have recovered. About 73 per cent of the IOC's income of Â£4.39billion ($5.7billion) in the latest four-year Olympic cycle was from selling broadcast rights. The US network NBC makes up at least half of the broadcast payments. Another 18 per cent of IOC income is from sponsorships. NBC parent company Comcast said that because of insurance and the way contracts are written, NBC won't suffer losses if the Olympics are canceled. But Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said the company would miss out on ad-driven profits, which were Â£192.45million ($250million) for the 2016 Rio Olympics. The ad profits for 2020 are expected to be larger. NBC signed a deal to pay Â£3.37billion ($4.38billion) for four Olympics - 2014 through 2020. It has a new agreement to pay Â£5.97billion ($7.75billion) for the following six Olympics. Christopher Chase, an attorney based in New York who specializes in sports, intellectual property and media, said sponsors and broadcasters were unlikely to sue for breach of contracts if the games are not held, or the conditions were changed. Mr Chase, a partner in the law firm Frankfurt Kurnit, said many such contracts would have 'force majeure' or 'changed circumstances' clauses. These would spell out unforeseeable conditions that keep a contract from being fulfilled, acting as a defense for non-performance by either party, but in this case, more likely the event producer. Mr Chase said: 'The last thing [the IOC] want to do is refund fees or lower the cost of what the sponsorship is.' He added: 'The last thing they want to do is give any money back or charge less. 'So typically what they try to do is negotiate some kind of make-good or substitute benefits.' Over and above the IOC's major sponsorship deals, local sponsors have paid just over Â£2.31billion ($3billion) to the organising committee. Mr Chase added: 'Any party that has already spent money to put people on the ground, flights and hotel rooms and all those types of things, are most likely going to lose out on that. 'The sponsorship fee may be the least of their concerns.'"
55,Italy suspends MORTGAGE payments in the wake of coronavirus outbreak's economic impact on families and small businessesÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095269/Italy-suspends-MORTGAGE-payments-wake-coronavirus-outbreak.html,"Payments on mortgages for families and small businesses will be suspended across the whole of Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak's worsening impact on the country's economy, the deputy economy minister said today. 'Yes, that will be the case, for individuals and households,' Laura Castelli, Italy's deputy economy minister, said in an interview with Radio Anch'io today, when asked about the possibility. Italy's banking lobby ABI said on Monday lenders representing 90 per cent of total banking assets would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout from Italy's coronavirus outbreak. The news comes as Italy announced that it had doubled the amount it plans to spend on tackling its coronavirus outbreak to Â£6.5billion and is raising this year's deficit goal to 2.5 per cent of national output from the current 2.2 per cent target. The move is being repeated across the globe, with British firms the Bank of Scotland offering similar financial protections for SMEs and individuals affected by the killer disease. Speaking to La Repubblica, prime minister Conte yesterday vowed a course of 'massive shock therapy' to aid the Italian economy after much of its industrial and business heartland was shut down. The Milan stock market, which was already down some 17 per cent since the outbreak in northern Italy, plunged at Monday's opening, with the blue chip FTMIB index down 11 per cent. Matching similar calls from France, Conte said strict European Union borrowing limits should be loosened to allow more room for manoeuvre, and that the flexibility envisaged by the EU's budget rules should be used 'in full'. 'Europe cannot think of confronting an extraordinary situation with ordinary measures,' he said. The European Commission told Italy on Saturday that its planned extra spending in response to the outbreak would not be counted in measuring its compliance with EU budget rules. 'The economic measures in the works will be vigorous, commensurate to current needs, but temporary,' the economy ministry said, adding that Italy remained committed to reducing its debt as soon as possible. The planned economic measures come as Italian Prime Minister Conte announced the entirety of the country would be placed on lock down. Italian streets and piazzas were empty today while shoppers crammed into supermarkets to stock up for a lengthy quarantine as the country began an unprecedented nationwide quarantine. Milan's shopping galleries, Rome's Spanish Steps and the Vatican's St Peter's Square were all deserted today after prime minister Conte extended the drastic coronavirus measures to the entire country last night. Panic-buyers were packing into supermarkets in Rome this morning with queues stretching outside because of a rule that demands a 3ft gap between shoppers - meaning only a limited number can go inside at once. In Naples, police were roaming the streets with a loudhailer last night to warn people to 'stay indoors, avoid unnecessary outings and avoid crowded places' because of the 'coronavirus emergency'. Conte declared last night that 'everyone must give up something to protect the health of citizens' with 9,000 virus cases confirmed in Italy and 463 people dead. Anyone with a fever has been ordered to stay indoors with travel banned except in emergencies and public gatherings including weddings, funerals and sports fixtures shut down. The virus is spreading so quickly that doctors are now having to make life-or-death decisions about who gets access to intensive care. The economy has been crippled by COVID-19, with Â£150billion wiped off the value of leading UK firms yesterday on what was termed a new Black Monday. The International Monetary Fund told governments and central banks around the world yesterday to take 'targeted' action to help households and businesses, including cutting interest rates.    "
56,"Coronavirus crisis drives the price of gold to seven-year highs above $1,700 - could the precious metal break the $2,000 barrier?",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-8095925/Could-gold-price-break-2-000-barrier-2020.html,"The gold price has topped $1,700 as investors sought safe havens in response to the coronovirus crisis, which has sparked fears of a global pandemic. A health catastrophe on this scale is unprecedented in a globalised economy, and it is unclear at present when it might start to subside. On the financial front, market panics and emergency measures like last week's 0.5 per cent rate cut in the US could be a sign of things to come, and may drive the gold price above its all-time peak of $1,900 in summer 2011. The gold price has receded since yesterday to around $1,650, but financial experts say this is because traders are being forced to cash in positions in the precious metal to cover loans and losses in the stock market. In pounds, the gold price hit a new record above Â£1,300 late last month, and it is at around Â£1,280 today. However, this is still a currency-driven phenomenon - due to sterling weakness since the Brexit referendum - as gold is still well off its peak in US dollars, which it is typically priced in. Investors see gold as a store of wealth and hedge against inflation as well as a safe haven asset during financial and political upsets. Interest rate cuts, or quantitative easing - money printing - particularly in the US, make gold more attractive to investors as this weakens the dollar and can fuel inflation. But the gold price fell and then stagnated in the years following the financial crisis of 2008, as global stock markets boomed and inflation failed to materialise, despite the vast money-printing experiments carried out by central banks in the US, UK, eurozone and Japan. Demand for 'physical gold', including coins and bars, can be driven by different factors. For example, the festival of Diwali is a popular time to buy gold jewellery in India. But even when such demand is strong, it can be offset by volatility in 'paper gold', in the form of exchange-traded funds, held by institutional players like banks and hedge funds. Meanwhile, a strong dollar makes gold more expensive and can this can deter all types of buyers. And as, like gold, the dollar is considered a safe haven in times of trouble, which causes it to strengthen, these two trading trends sometimes work against each other. 'Gold is once again having a difficult time,' said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe, on Tuesday. 'Buoyed initially by the sheer amount of risk aversion and monetary easing being priced in, which saw the price briefly move above $1,700, it's since pared those gains and found support around $1,650 earlier today, with today's slightly improved sentiment proving a drag. 'Once again, it seems yesterday's aggressive sell-off hindered gold's ascent, with traders possibly forced to liquidate positions to cover margin calls or losses elsewhere. Traders using borrowed money to fund their activities via 'margin accounts' face calls to top them up with extra money or sell some of their holdings when markets fall and they rack up losses. Unlike 'cash accounts', which are funded in cash, margin accounts allow traders to borrow against the value of their holdings. 'The environment generally remains bullish for the yellow metal though, with $1,700 likely to face further challenges.' David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'Gold is lower as some dealers are cashing in their long gold positions to cover margin calls on stocks. 'The metal eked out a fresh seven-year high early into the trading session but the aggressive sell-off in equities ended up hitting the metal. 'If we see a rebound in stocks we might see gold head back towards the $1,700 area.' Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, said: 'Used for little else besides storing value, gold has served that role in all cultures in all ages. 'It's the only natural resource which investors flock to when its consumer demand looks set to drop. 'Over the last seven days, trading volumes on BullionVault have jumped 102 per cent from the previous 52-week average, with more than Â£38.2million of gold, silver and platinum changing hands in total.' Savers have a number of ways of buying gold as an investment, writes Simon Lambert. Physical gold is the main way to tap direct into actual gold, by buying bullion or coins. This can either be done through a traditional dealer or through an online service such as GoldMadeSimple, or BullionVault. You can read more about how to do this on the World Gold Council's website. Exchange Traded Commodities are also a direct route into gold. ETCs, like Exchange Traded Funds, track a particular sector, or in this case commodity. They are passive investments and should merely mirror gold's moves, although some will offer leveraged returns or the opportunity to short the price. Make sure you understand the difference between ETCs that are physical (actually buying gold) and synthetic (set up to mimic its price). Read this guide to ETFs. Funds enable investors to buy into a basket of shares of gold miners, producers and associated companies. However, the performance of individual firms does not always echo gold's rises and falls, and in fact, gold mining shares can fare worse than the gold price - especially smaller companies.

57,Staff at Wall Street billionaire Steve Cohen's hedge fund are sent home and told to self-quarantine for 14 days after employee tests positive for coronavirus,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095423/Staff-Wall-Street-billionaire-Steve-Cohens-hedge-fund-sent-home.html,"Staff at Wall Street billionaire Steve Cohen's hedge fund have been sent home and told to self-quarantine after an employee tested positive for coronavirus. Employees at Point72 Asset Management discovered on Monday that a worker on the 14th floor of the firm'sHudson Yards office, in New York, had been diagnosed with COVID-19. An insider told Page Sixthat staff who worked on the floor with the patient have been sent home for a mandatory 14-day quarantine as the office undergoes a deep clean. Business travel on behalf of thehedge fund, which is based in Manhattan, has also reportedly been restricted. It was also claimed the employee who was diagnosed with coronavirus has been 'self-quarantined at home' since early last week but is in 'very good condition, health-wise'. The source added that Point72 intended to remain fully functional as most employees are able to work from home. A spokesperson for the firm confirmed the case to Page Six and said in a statement that it is 'working closely with state and local health departments' to 'protect our employees and maintain a healthy work environment'. 'The health and safety of our employees is a top priority, and we are taking the COVID-19 situation seriously,' Point72 spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin-Cohen said. 'In addition to working closely with state and local health departments, we are taking precautions and preventative measures to protect our employees and maintain a healthy work environment. 'We have extensive business continuity plans in place to ensure the firm can continue to operate.' There have so-far been142 cases of coronavirus confirmed across New York state, including the head of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Rick Cotton. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday, following the action of California, Washington, and Florida. Across the US, around 754 cases have been reported, with 24 deaths due to coronavirus confirmed."
58,"How a US drug company's strategy meeting in Boston started a cluster of coronavirus infections, with more than two dozen cases across four states linked to it",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8095813/How-strategy-meeting-drug-company-spread-coronavirus.html,"A strategy meeting of a Massachusetts-based drug company has EMERGED as being responsible for at least xx cases of coronavirus in the US. The meeting of Biogen Inc, heldat the Boston Marriott Long Wharf hotel, was attended by 175 of the company's senior mangers from February 26 to February 27. They then held meetings with by doctors, nurses, investors and pharmaceutical representatives from across the county, as well as their own communities, But, since that meeting, at least three employees have tested positive including an unnamed Biogen executive who is currently in isolation. The meeting is also linked to at least 32 cases in Massachusetts and several cases in three other states. The strategy meeting is an annual event for Biogen, which has an estimated 7,500 employees around the world and xx MONEY. A spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that about a week after the meeting, some people complained of symptoms resembling the flu. Biogen reportedly reached out to public health authorities, who asked that meeting attendees self-quarantine for 14 days to monitor their conditions. An infectious disease expert explained that meetings such as the one held by Biogen are prime locations for the virus spreading. 'There's a lot of handshaking, there's a lot of being in close quarters, and that puts you at risk,' Dr Manish Trivedi, the director of the division of infectious diseases at AtlantiCare in New Jersey told The Wall Street Journal. 'You eat something. You rub your eyes. You touch your face.' Massachusetts has experienced the biggest impact from the virus spreading at the Biogen meeting, which is no surprise because the company is headquartered in Cambridge. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most common symptoms are: Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Officials at the state's health department said on Monday that 32 patients have links to the meeting. In addition, at least two people from Indiana who attended the meeting have been diagnosed the virus, Indiana's state health department said. There are also at least five residents of Wake County, North Carolina who are 'presumptive positive' cases, according to Wake County's Public Health Division. The Journal reports that a Biogen employee from Pennsylvania who traveled to a conference held in West Palm Beach, Florida, later was diagnosed with the virus. Biogen said of its employees infected by the virus, two lived in the European Union, and one outside of Massachusetts. All the attendees of the meeting have been asked to work from home for two weeks, irrespective of whether or not they showed symptoms, Biogen said. It said it was also restricting travel through the end of March, joining retailer Walmart Inc, which on Thursday put a restriction on all international travels to business-critical trips, at least through March and April. [The Biogen meetingâ€™s role in transmitting coronavirus] has forced schools to scramble to prevent the virus from spreading further. Schools in Wellesley and Arlington closed for at least a day after learning that students had linked to people who attended the Biogen meeting, The Journal reported. One student did test positive for coroanvirus, and they are in isolation. Anyone who may have come into close contact with the student is in self-quarantine for 14 days. A few other attendees of the internal company meeting were diagnosed with influenza, Biogen said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Friday. It did not disclose the number of influenza patients, or the location where the employees that tested positive for coronavirus were being treated. Worldwide, more than 114,000 people in more than 100 countries have been infected with coronavirus and more than 4,000 people have died. In the US, more then 750 people have contracted coronavirus in at least 35 states and 26 people - in California, Florida and Washington - have died. By Natalie Rahhal, Acting US Health Editor for DailyMail.com  HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 percent of people who contract the Covid-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital â€“ with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, some 51,000 people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus â€“ and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis. HOW MANY PEOPLE DIE? Officially, the death rate so far has been just over three percent. But experts believe the true mortality rate is probably between one and two percent. This is because most mild cases have not been picked up by doctors or reflected in the official numbers â€“ so the death rate is inflated. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE WITH OTHER DISEASES? Seasonal flu kills roughly 0.1 percent of people. So Covid-19 is between 10 and 20 times more fatal. But it is far less dangerous than SARS â€“ the virus that ripped across China in 2003 â€“ which killed 10 percent of patients. BUT DOESNâ€™T CORONAVIRUS SPREAD MORE EASILY? Yes, but not dramatically. The best estimates suggest every person with Covid-19 passes it on to 2.6 people, on average. For flu that number is 1.5. CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS? Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on. That is now in doubt. What is likely, however, is those who have mild symptoms are putting it down to a cold and going about their normal lives â€“ which puts others at risk. HOW LONG IS IT BEFORE SYMPTOMS APPEAR? Again, unclear. Initially scientists said this could take up to two weeks. But recent evidence suggests the incubation period could be as long as a month â€“ particularly among children. The average, however, is much shorter. A Chinese study said the average period of symptom onset was 5.4 days for adults and 6.5 for children. WHO IS AT RISK? The virus can affect anyone â€“ with a study of the first 41 infected people revealing two thirds did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. But the middle-aged are most likely to get it â€“ 78 percent of those infected in China have been aged 30 to 69. WHAT ABOUT THE OLD? Only 3 percent of people infected so far have been over 80 â€“ but if they get it they are more vulnerable. Analysis of 72,000 cases in China suggests for over-80s the death rate is 15 percent. For those in their 70s the death rate is 8 percent and for those in their 60s, 4 percent. WHO ELSE IS VULNERABLE? Those with other conditions â€“ such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney problems â€“ are likely to suffer severe complications if they become infected. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? Children seem to be low-risk. Less than 1 percent of the Chinese cases have been under the age of ten â€“ and if children do get the virus itâ€™s often a mild form. They do, however, retain the virus for longer than adults. A study last week found the virus was still present in the stools of some children for a month after they contracted it. DOES GENDER MATTER? Men are marginally more likely to get the virus than women. It is not clear why this is. HOW DO DOCTORS TEST FOR COVID-19? Anyone who has symptoms â€“particularly if they have travelled to an at-risk area â€“ are told to call ahead to their health care provider, local emergency department or clinics. This way, health care providers can be prepared, wearing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment when they meet the possible patient and escort them to isolated areas of the facility. They are tested using a cheek swab which is sent off for analysis at one of 12 Public Health England labs, a process that takes between 24 and 48 hours. Any positive test is double-checked at the main PHE lab in Colindale. WHAT TREATMENT DO PATIENTS GET? There is little doctors can do to tackle the virus, but they can treat the symptoms â€“ such as fever and respiratory problems. Antivirals and antibiotics are also used, mainly to keep secondary problems at bay. In the most serious cases patients are put on life-support equipment. There are several clinical trials for potential coronavirus treatments ongoing worldwide, including one in Nebraska, where at least 13 patients are in quarantine, including two in biocontainment units. WHAT ABOUT A VACCINE? Even though the Wuhan virus appeared only a few weeks ago, 20 teams around the world are already manufacturing vaccines. Chinese authorities provided the DNA code for the virus early on in the outbreak, enabling scientists to get to work straight away. At least 30 companies and research institutions in the US are racing to make a vaccine. Last week, one of these companies, Moderna, shipped its candidate vaccine to the US, signalling the shot was ready to begin clinical trials.

The movie, starring Domhnall Gleeson, Rose Byrne and the voice of James Corden, was due to be released across Europe on March 27 and in the US on April 3. However, Sony Pictures announced today that the release date had been pushed back to August 7 amid the spread of the infection which has killed 4,000 people. Mother Danielle Kirk tweeted: 'Just seen they've moved the release date for Peter Rabbit 2, my kids gonna be f***ing furious - you monsters.' Twitter user Daisy added: 'Actually so annoyed Peter Rabbit 2 has been delayed until August. Was so excited to watch it at the end of this month.' And Michelle from Basildon, Essex, tweeted Cineworld to say: 'I just read that Peter Rabbit 2 won't be released until August now due to the coronavirus. Is this correct? I already have tickets booked for it. My daughter is looking forward to it.' Meanwhile US-based film critic Mike McGranaghan said: 'This doesn't bode well for the summer blockbusters. If freaking Peter Rabbit 2 is getting postponed because of coronavirus fears, can Black Widow and other high profile films be far behind?' It comes a week after the biggest film release of next month, the new James Bond film No Time to Die, was postponed from early April to November. Much of that film's early promotion had already begun, with star Daniel Craig hosting 'Saturday Night Live' and the release of Billie Eilish's theme song. Cinemas have been closed in China for several weeks, while Italy shut all its venues yesterday amid social distancing measures to help prevent the virus spreading. Since coronavirus first emerged in late December 2019, more than 115,124 cases have been recorded in 105 countries and territories, killing 4,067 people. More than 15,000 cases have been counted in Europe, although the worst affected country is mainland China, which has had 80,754 cases, including 3,136 deaths. Italy is in second place with 9,172 cases and 463 deaths, followed by South Korea with 7,513 cases and 54 deaths, and Iran with 8,042 cases and 291 deaths. The previous Peter Rabbit film released in February 2018 was one of that year's top animated releases, grossing Â£269million worldwide. A trailer for the new movie directed by Will Gluck showedCorden's lovable rogue hops away from his beloved garden to have daredevil adventures in the big city."
60,Elite sex club Snctm insists orgies in LA and New York WILL go ahead despite coronavirus sweeping the US (but saucy masks are mandatory),https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8096309/Elite-sex-club-Snctm-insists-orgies-LA-New-York-ahead.html,"An elite sex club has insisted that two upcoming orgies will go ahead despite coronavirus outbreaks across the US. Snctm, reportedly attended by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Bill Maher, said there are no plans to cancel a sex party scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on Saturday or another due to take place in Manhattan in April. Attendees will be screened for the virus ahead of time, the company said, while venues will be sanitized and extra sanitizer and soap provided at the parties. It comes despite the CDC warning Americans to avoid shaking hands, touching hand rails and elevator buttons, and to avoid crowded spaces. 'The company takes all of this very seriously, for the safety of those attending,' a spokesman told Page Six. 'Refunds are also being given to those who desire to not attend, no questions asked.' Attendees are usually required to wear masks on arrival, though of an entirely different kind to those that help shield against coronavirus. California currently has 143 confirmed cases of the virus, though medics have warned it is now spreading freely among communities and that number is expected to rise significantly as more tests are carried out. Santa Clara County, which has the largest number of confirmed cases at 43, has begun banning large gatherings in order to slow the spread of the virus. Large numbers of potential patients are also being evacuated from the Grand Princess cruise ship, currently harbored in Oakland, and taken to military bases in California to wait out possible infections. Meanwhile New York has confirmed 140 cases, with 25 in the city itself, although Mayor Bill De Blasio has said widespread school closures and bans on public gatherings are not yet necessary. 'We cannot shut down because of undue fear,' de Blasio told MSNBC's Morning Joe. 'I would advise against these mass closures when we're keeping this situation relatively contained... ask me in a week, ask me in a month - it might change.' Health officials have previously said school closures in the city would be a last resort. The main cluster of cases in the state remains in Westchester where a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week and subsequently infected his family and others. There were 98 confirmed cases in Westchester as of Monday. The US death toll from the disease is currently at 26 with the majority being from Washington state following an outbreak at a nursing home just outside Seattle."

Theentrepreneur, 48, said Tesla should organize the party 'with an epic sound system and woofers the size of a car' after he ranted theCalifornian festival should 'postpone itself until it stops sucking'. Coachella is reportedly planning to move from April to October over growing coronavirus fears in the US, where 26 people have died due to the virus. The postponement would follow last week's cancellation of South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas and Miami EDM festival Ultra. But the news didn't appear to bother Musk, who tweeted the festival should 'postpone itself' as 'too much corporate sponsorship killed the vibe' shortly after rumours began to surface. He added that the event 'was good maybe five or six years ago when you could wonder around and find great unknown bands'. Around 20 minutes later, Musk asked his 32million Twitter followers whether 'Tesla should have a mega rave cave under the Berlin Gigafactory'. The message was accompanied by a 'yes' or 'no' poll, which has so-far received 446,288 votes. The 'yes' votes are by far in the lead. Musk then joked the event, held at Tesla's upcoming European manufacturing plant in Germany, would feature performances from the likes of Rammstein. Other suggested acts included German bandKraftwerk andBoris Brejcha. Tesla's co-called 'Gigafactory'near Berlin is expected to open its doors by 2021, producing electric cars including Tesla's latest Model Y SUV. Rumours of Coachella's postponement come as authorities in the Coachella Valley confirmed three new cases of coronavirus on Monday. The cases were confirmed by the Riverside County Department of Public Health. Dr Cameron Kaiser, county public health officer, said the three infections were either the result of travel into areas where COVID-19 has been confirmed or contact with a known case. Two of the individuals have been isolated at home, Dr Kaiser said, while the third is being cared for at a Coachella Valley hospital. Musk has been vocal in his dismissal of 'coronavirus panic', last week provoking a significant online response when he tweeted: 'The coronavirus panic is dumb'. Coachella,held in Indio, south-east California, had announced headlining acts Rage Against The Machine, Frank Ocean and Travis Scott to appear over three weekends in April. Agents are now reportedly looking to re-book the artists for Coachella to begin on October 9, Variety reported."

Hairstylist Phil Ring shared a video of one ingenious driver's efforts to protect himself from the deadly virus while driving in Manhattan. A cube of plastic surrounds the driver, fashioned from a clear sheet of plastic which was taped to the roof and a pole to keep it in place. 'My Lyft driver created this airtight seal in his car,' Ring shared in the video's caption. 'If anyone out there is doing Lyft or Uber for work, you may consider doing this to protect yourself and others.' Scroll down for video A box of tissues sits next to the driver on the car's armrest but it is unknown if the passengers were also treated with a box of tissues. One has to wonder how the service was for the ride since all the plastic would make it difficult for the rider to talk to his passenger. The video comes as thereare now 149 cases of coronavirus in New York state. The main cluster of cases remains in Westchester where a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week and subsequently infected his family and others. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged people to bike or walk to work and to avoid using the subway unless it is essential. As the number of cases continued to rise, de Blasio urged New Yorkers to try to reduce overcrowding and acknowledged that subway cars made it difficult for people to avoid direct contact with those who could be infected. He encouraged people to bike or walk to work if they weren't able to work from home. 'We need everyone to do their part in reducing overcrowding. I know that sounds impossible in New York City, but consider some basic steps like telecommuting if your job allows it,' de Blasio tweeted. 'Stagger work schedules so people can arrive later or leave earlier to beat the busiest times of rush hour. 'Plan to have some extra travel time in your commute. If the train that pulls up is too packed, move to a different car or wait to take the next one. Bike or walk to work if you can.'"
63,"Grandmother, 77, trapped on coronavirus-stricken cruise ship off US coast complains of going 'stir crazy' after being confined to her cabin for five days",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8095533/British-grandmother-77-trapped-coronavirus-cruise-ship-complains-going-stir-crazy.html,"Hundreds of Britons on a coronavirus-stricken US cruise ship will not be forcibly quarantined when they return home, it emerged today. More than 140 UK holidaymakers are currently stranded on the Grand Princess in San Francisco after 21 people tested positive for the killer virus on board. The British passengers will be flown home on a repatriation flight tonight after being left in limbo and locked in their cabins for six days. But the UK nationals will be free to make their own way home when they land in Britain and won't be forced to quarantine, MailOnline understands. Instead, they will be asked to self-isolate at home and told to only get in touch with the NHS if they fall ill - despite the fact infect patients are highly contagious a week before showing symptoms. It has sparked fears the returning passengers may spread the virus at home and exacerbate the UK crisis which has seen 373 infections and six deaths. Hundreds of Americans that were on the Grand Princess have already disembarked and are being whisked off to quarantine in military bases scattered around the States. Canadians were also allowed off the ship yesterday and flown back home where quarantine measures are in place ready for them. Cruises are perfect breeding grounds for the highly contagious virus which spreads via a simple cough or sneeze and can live on handrails and doorknobs for days. There were more than 700 infections and six deaths on the Diamond Princess cruise shipwhich was quarantined off Japan in February. Health officials in the US were keen not to have a repeat of the outbreak last month and ruled out quarantining the American ship. Instead they drew up plans to evacuate everyone on board and fly them to their respective countries to be isolated and treated there. The 142 Brits were among 3,500 passengers and crew from 50 different countries on the ship, which had beencruising around the Californian coast. It arrived in San Francisco yesterday, where hundreds of American and Canadian passengers were allowed to disembark.  US passengers are being flown or bused from the port to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia for testing and a 14-day quarantine. California residents will be sent to the Travis Air Force base in Fairfield or Marine Corps Air Station Miramar near San Diego.   Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. The most common symptoms are: Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Non-Californians will be flown to Joint Base San Antonio Lackland in Texas or Dobbins Air Force Base in Georgia. Some 240 Canadians were loaded on specially-chartered evacuation flights home to start a quarantine of their own. Around 2,000 people - including 142 Britons - were left on the ship overnight, anxiously waiting for disembarkation to restart on Tuesday morning for their chance to leave. But UK nationals will have to wait until Tuesday evening local time (Wednesday morning in the UK) for a repatriation flight. British passengers with symptoms won't be allowed on the plane and will be taken to a hospital in San Francisco instead. It is unclear where the evacuated will land but it is not thought to be RAF Brize Norton inOxfordshire or Boscombe Down in Wiltshire, where previous repatriated Britons have been quarantined. A British grandmother stuck on board said she was going 'stir crazy' and passengers were having to fight over 'rotten food'. Margaret Bartlett, 77, from Burnley, told the BBC: 'The food is rotten and terrible and we have to fight for it. It is not good enough. 'We are going stir crazy stuck in the cabin. It is a bit depressing when we saw land and it was sunny and we couldn't get out. We are hoping something will get done. It is terrible.' Before the ship docked yesterday, Mrs Bartlett said she was 'dreading' being stuck on board as some Americans are taken off. She told the BBC: 'There is no reassurance that the ship is about to dock as I don't think she is going to get off. My greatest fear is that they will be kept on that ship for two weeks.' Mrs Bartlett's daughter Lyndsey Vickers said she was 'very worried' about her mother after a passenger who was staying 10 cabins away from the grandmother died from the killer infection. Someone who is infected with the coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze, scientists say. More than 4,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 110,000 have been infected. Here's what we know so far: What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000. Just a week after that, there had been more than 800 confirmed cases and those same scientists estimated that some 4,000 â€“ possibly 9,700 â€“ were infected in Wuhan alone. By that point, 26 people had died. By January 27, more than 2,800 people were confirmed to have been infected, 81 had died, and estimates of the total number of cases ranged from 100,000 to 350,000 in Wuhan alone. By January 29, the number of deaths had risen to 132 and cases were in excess of 6,000. By February 5, there were more than 24,000 cases and 492 deaths. By February 11, this had risen to more than 43,000 cases and 1,000 deaths. A change in the way cases are confirmed on February 13 â€“ doctors decided to start using lung scans as a formal diagnosis, as well as laboratory tests â€“ caused a spike in the number of cases, to more than 60,000 and to 1,369 deaths. By February 25, around 80,000 people had been infected and some 2,700 had died. February 25 was the first day in the outbreak when fewer cases were diagnosed within China than in the rest of the world. Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats.Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals â€“ the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by theWuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. There is now evidence that it can spread third hand â€“ to someone from a person who caught it from another person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms â€“ but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much â€“ changing is known as mutating â€“ much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak is an epidemic, which is when a disease takes hold of one community such as a country or region. Although it has spread to dozens of countries, the outbreak is not yet classed as a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. The head of WHO's global infectious hazard preparedness, Dr Sylvie Briand, said: 'Currently we are not in a pandemic. We are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci, and we try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci,' the Guardian reported. She said that most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.   "

An unidentified 40-year-old woman has been diagnosed with the killer disease, the island's first case, after having recently travelled to Israel andEgypt. She was placed in quarantine on Sunday, the public ERT television reported. Greek authorities have expressed concern over the possibility of the virus spreading on islands such as Lesbos, where thousands of migrants are crammed in overcrowded camps or living rough. A school, attended by the woman's two children in Plomari, was closed amid fears of an outbreak. Lesbos is hosting 27,000 migrants and refugees at a reception centre at Moria outside the port capital, Mytilene, the Guardian reported. The reception is made to house just 3,000 people. More than 1,700 asylum seekers arrived in Greek islands on the Aegean sea last week, the majority in Lesbos, after Turkey decided to open its borders with Greece. Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdogan planned to pressure the European Union to implement what he called an unfulfilled pledge under a previous migrant deal. Greece's health ministry on Monday reported 11 new coronavirus cases but did not mention Lesbos. A total of 84 cases have been reported in the country. Most of the new cases in the country involve a group of pilgrims who visited Israel and Egypt at the end of February, travelling in the same bus. Greece has banned public gatherings, closed several schools and universities and ordered professional sports events to be held behind closed doors for 15 days beginning Monday. "
65,Carnival cruise ship off of Marseilles becomes the latest to be refused permission to dock over coronavirus fears as two passengers are evacuated for tests,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095393/Carnival-cruise-ship-Marseilles-latest-refused-permission.html,"A cruise ship off the French coast became the latest to have its journey disrupted by coronavirus after it was denied permission to dock in Marseilles today. Two passengers on the German-owned vessel Aidasol were hauled off the ship after showing flu-like symptoms - sparking fears they had been infected with the virus. Their fellow tourists were kept on the ship while the two passengers were tested in hospital on the mainland. However, the tests eventually came back negative, said a spokesman for the Marseilles port authority. According to public service broadcaster France Bleu, a speedboat was dispatched to send emergency workers to the ship and retrieve the suspected virus patients. The Aidasol had been due to have a stopover in Marseilles today, but French authorities refused permission. The local health authority confirmed that two people were taken to Marseille and were being tested in the port city. The seven-day cruise, entitled Pearls of the Mediterranean, is meant to stop at Marseilles after arriving from Mallorca and Barcelona, according to the company's website. It is then intended to continue to Italy, stopping in Livorno and Rome before ending up back in Mallorca. The ship is owned by AIDA Cruises, a German subsidiary of cruise ship giant Carnival Corporation. Health authorities around the world have been keeping a watchful eye on cruise ships after a series of voyages were wrecked by virus fears in recent weeks. The Diamond Princess became one of the world's largest clusters of virus cases when more than 700 people tested positive during a two-week quarantine in Japan. A sister ship, the Grand Princess, has been held off the US coast for days after a former passenger died of the virus. Another vessel, the MS Westerdam, was turned away by five governments in a sign of official panic over cruise ships despite no cases being confirmed on board. Several other ships have had their journeys disrupted by the virus after passengers required urgent tests or countries refused them permission to dock. Experts have highlighted a number of reasons why cruise ships are vulnerable to the spread of disease, including the large number of elderly passengers in a confined space. Some passengers have started to cancel cruise ship bookings or abandon plans to make them as the virus continues to spread around the world. Cruise ships have also taken preventative measures themselves, with Royal Caribbean turning away guests with passports from China, Hong Kong and Macau and guarding against arrivals from Italy, Iran and South Korea."

Lieutenant General Christopher Cavoli was ""self-monitoring"" and working remotely for now, the Army said in a statement. A U.S. official told Reuters that the conference involved land force commanders and took place in Wiesbaden, Germany, last week. One of the foreign participants has been confirmed to have the virus, the official said. 'Out of an abundance of caution and following recommended protocols, he and others potentially affected are self-monitoring and working remotely to fulfill their command duties and responsibilities,' Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said in a statement to Stars and Stripes. 'U.S. Army Europe public health officials have notified all other U.S. personnel who were at risk of exposure,' McCarthy added. 'We are conducting daily assessments of the situation and are consulting with medical professionals, the joint and OSD staff, our exercise host nations, and other allies and partners.' Pentagon officials recently announced that they're practicing 'social distancing' measures, in keeping with recommendations from Air Force Brig. General Paul Friedrichs, who advised keeping distance, wiping workspaces and covering mouths when coughing, the Army Timesreported. 'I think the secretary is trying to set the example that we need to take some of these common sense measuresâ€¦such as social distancing seriously and to implement those. And to do it in a way that we can continue to go about the business of the Pentagon,â€ said Jonathan Hoffman, Pentagon spokesman. Cavoli was commissioned into the infantry after graduating Princeton University in 1987, according to his Wikipedia page. He was made a captain and served as an instructor at Ranger School from 1992 to 1994, and served in Bosnia in 2000.

67,Does high blood pressure increase coronavirus mortality rate and will taking my medication lower the risk?Â ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8093015/Up-50-coronavirus-patients-hypertension-die-lower-risk.html,"A top Chinese intensive care unit doctor sayspatients with hypertension are at a higher risk of dying fromcoronavirus. Researchers have found that about six percent of patients - most aged 60 or older - with high blood pressure die from the new virus compared to healthy people. There are currently about 80 million people in the US - one in every three - suffering from high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association. So what can you if you become sickened to lower your chances of falling critically ill? Health experts say to make sure you regularly take your medication (and stock up in case of shortages!) and exercise to strengthen your heart muscles. The firststudy found that patients with underlying conditions had higher mortality rates - 10.5 percent for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3 percent for diabetes, 6.3 percent for chronic respiratory disease, six percent for hypertension, and 5.6 percent for cancer. In the new, very small-scale study, researchers examined 170 older patients who died in Wuhan in mid-January, Bloomberg reported. Of those patients, nearly 50 percent had hypertension. 'That's a very high ratio,' Dr Du Bin, director of the intensive care unit at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, told Bloomberg. 'From what I was told by other doctors and the data I can see myself, among all the underlying diseases, hypertension is a key dangerous factor.' So far, there are no studies that explain why this is the case, but many coronavirus patients with uncontrollable blood pressure go into severe distress before passing away. 'We believe hypertension could be an important factor in causing patients to deteriorate, leading to a bad prognosis,' Dr Du told Bloomberg. However, a study published last year linked respiratory diseases with high blood pressure in the lungs. Researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia looked at patients with pulmonary hypertension, a type of high blood pressure that affects the lungs. This conditions occurs when tiny blood vessels in the lungs become narrowed or blocked, which can be worsened by a respiratory disease such as COVID-19. It can also cause the heart to weaken, so exercise regularly to strengthen your heart muscles. In the US, more than 50 percent of the 80 million adults with hypertension are people aged 60 and above. That's the same age at which an increasing risk of the disease starts and it only continues with age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials encouraged the elderly to stock up on food and medications and to avoid going outside as the coronavirus spreads. 'Make sure you have supplies on hand like routine medications for blood pressure and diabetes, and over the counter medicines and medical supplies to treat fever and other symptoms,' Dr Nancy Messonnier,director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a call to reporters on Monday. Worldwide, more than 113,000 have been infected in more than 100 countries and more than 4,000 people have died. In the US, more than 680 people have been infected in at least 34 states and 26 people - in California, Florida and Washington - have died. Several colleges across the country - including the University of Washington, Columbia, Fordham and Princeton - have canceled in-person classes and will be holding online classes. "
68,The Pope urges priests to visit coronavirus sufferers as he celebrates Mass in the Vatican alone on livestream amid Italy's lockdown,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095021/The-Pope-urges-priests-visit-coronavirus-sufferers.html,"Pope Francis today urged Catholic priests to visit people suffering from coronavirus despite a ban on most travel across Italy. Francis prayed that clergymen would 'have the courage to go out and go to the sick people' as he celebrated Mass by himself at the Vatican this morning. The service in the chapel of Francis' residence was live-streamed by the Vatican today, with the 83-year-old pontiff avoiding public gatherings. Italy has imposed tough new quarantine rules nationwide, including a ban on most travel, but there are limited exceptions for 'urgent' work and health reasons. In his homily today, Francis prayed for Italy's thousands of sick patients and the doctors and nurses who are caring for them. 'Let us pray to the Lord also for our priests, that they may have the courage to go out and go to the sick people bringing the strength of God's word and the Eucharist and accompany the health workers and volunteers in this work that they are doing,' Francis said. His service today, held in the chapel of the Santa Marta guest house where he lives, came just hours after Italy extended its quarantine measures to the whole country. Travel across Italy is only allowed for 'urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons', according to a decree signed by Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte last night. 'Necessities' such as grocery shopping are allowed but it is unclear whether a clerical visit would belong to that category. People who want to travel will need to fill in a document explaining their reasons for doing so and carry it with them. If they are found to have lied they face fines or jail terms, but the restrictions will generally work on an honour system. Public transport will remain operational, but Conte says he wants as many people as possible to stay at home. The pope last week cancelled a series of engagements after suffering from a cold during an Ash Wednesday service. Fears were raised after Francis was pictured hugging and kissing members of the public after speaking with a hoarse voice and blowing his nose in church. However, the pontiff is thought to have tested negative for coronavirus last week. He resumed some private meetings yesterday, including with bishops from France and two departing ambassadors. Francis has enjoyed generally good health, although he had part of one lung removed as a younger man. The Vatican, which is surrounded by Rome, has imposed restrictions on movement and contact among its personnel in a bid to contain the virus. One person inside Vatican City has tested positive and five people who came into contact with that person are under precautionary quarantine. The Vatican Museums are also closed, including the Sistine Chapel, in yet another blow to Italy's valuable tourism industry. St Peter's Square, the centrepiece of the Vatican, was almost empty today with only a few dozen people walking around, most of them without masks. Italy registered 1,807 more confirmed cases as of Monday evening, for a national total of 9,172. The number of dead in Italy also increased by 97 to 463 - most of them elderly with previous ailments."
69,Jewish student sues her old high school for anti-Semitism claiming teacher encouraged reading of Mein Kampf and classmate posed for 'I h8 Jews' beach picture,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095763/Jewish-college-student-sues-old-high-school-discrimination-anti-Semitic-incidents.html,"A former student at a prestigious New Jersey magnet high school has filed a federal discrimination lawsuit alleging 'endemic anti-Semitism' at the Marine Academy of Science and Technology, and accusing school administrators of failing to put a stop to it. The plaintiff, who only wishes to use her first name, Paige, claims in her 65-page complaint that she was once sent a text message featuring a photo of a classmate posing on a beach next to the words 'I h8 Jews' written in the sand. On another occasion, someone left a rock near her desk at school scrawled with the name 'adolf.' The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Trenton last Wednesday, also accuses teachers at the school of poking fun at a classmate's last name, 'Giuffre,' and encouraging students to read Adolf Hitler's virulently anti-Semitic autobiographical manifesto 'Mein Kampf' in their free time. The state Attorney General's Office in November 2019 found probable cause that the school failed to adequately address anti-Semitic harassment targeting Paige, who eventually transferred out of the district in her senior year. According to the complaint, filed on the student's behalf by civil rights lawyer Eric Hecker, with the New Jersey firm Cuti Hecker Wang LLP, Paige enrolled at the elite public school specializing in marine sciences as a freshman in 2015, and on the first day of school heard an anti-Semitic exchange between two teachers and a student. The lawsuit recounts how to naval science teachers were having trouble pronouncing the last name of a student spelled 'Giuffre.' 'The student told the teachers how to pronounce his name, and they both laughed while one of them said that it sounded like 'Jew fray' and the other said he would not want to have a name like that,' the complaint alleges. During her time at MAST, Paige allegedly saw 'on numerous occasions' her fellow students drawing swastikas in their notebook, as well as on school lunch tables. 'This was a common practice among MAST students during the lunch hour, according to the lawsuit, which claims that school officials knew, or should have known, about the swastikas but failed to take any action. During the plaintiff'ssophomore year, Paige allegedly observed several of her schoolmates reading 'Mein Kampf' during their mandatory 'read period,' even though the curriculum did not include any studies of World War II or the rise of Nazi Germany. According to the complaint, some of the students said in class how much they liked Hitler's anti-Semitic opus, and one student in particular was often seen carrying the book. A naval science teacher at the school - one of the two who allegedly made fun of the last name 'Giuffre' - was heard praising 'Mein Kampf' as a 'great book,' according to the lawsuit. Also during Paige's sophomore year, another student allegedly created a video in which he doctor images of a naval science teacher sporting a mustache reminiscent of Hitler's a,d made it look like he was wearing a Nazi uniform. The recording also featured the date 'April 20,' Hitler's birthday.  When Paige's parents reported some of the anti-Semitic incidents to a school official, they were allegedly told 'there has always been racism and anti-Semitism and always will be.' Paige and her parents were said to have repeatedly raised concerns about anti-Semitism at the school, but the lawsuit alleges that their complaints had fallen on deaf ears. The final straw for Paige came toward the end of her junior year, when MAST sponsored a field trip to Sandy Hook Beach. She did not go on the trip because of a prior commitment, but later she received a photo as part of a text message chain featuring one of her schoolmates lying on the sand next to oversized letters spelling out the phrase 'I h8 Jews.' The student in the photo commented that the image should be the 'yearbook cover,' and another MAST student concurred, saying it would make a 'great' cover. After Paige and her parents complained to school administrators about the photo, an investigation was carried out and two students were suspended from school for four days, while a third student was given a two-day suspension for commenting on the text message chain. According to the complaint, Paige's classmates at MAST quickly figured out that she was the one who reported the incident to the school officials and labeled her a 'snitch.' She then became the target of an alleged retaliation campaign, which included having a rock with the name 'adolf' handwritten on it placed directly behind her seat in English class. Paige dropped out of MAST before her senior year with a 4.0 GPA and transferred to another school, but her stay there was short-lived because, according to the lawsuit, some of her former classmates spread rumors that she was a 'snitch,' which The complaint alleges that her departure from MAST after her junior year had hurt her chances of getting accepted into Tulane University, which was her college of choice. She applied to New York University, University of Pennsylvania, Emory University, Northwestern University, and the University of Virginia, but was rejected. Paige is now a freshman at an unspecified out-of-state college, where according to the complaint, she has been having trouble 'forging new friendships and establishing relationships with professors' because of her 'anger and trust' issues. The Monmouth County Vocational School District, which is named as a defendant in Paige's lawsuit, has released a statement saying MAST is committed to providing a safe and inclusive learning environment'for all students that is free from harassment, intimidation and bullying and all forms of bias and discrimination.' A lawyer representing the boy in the 'I h8 Jews' photo told New York Post it was intended as a 'tongue in cheek sarcastic joke' that was not to be taken literally. The student and the other teen connected to the photo had their admissions to Cornell University and NYU, respectively, after Paige's complaint to the stateAttorney General's Office last year."

The 35-year-old appeared on Australia's The Project on Tuesday night and became emotional as she recounted that bittersweet farewell, during which the pregnant star was able to tell Pearl that she was becoming a great-grandmother. The singer said: 'In my immediate family, it is the first time we've dealt with a loss. And she was 99, and I got to say goodbye and tell her that I was with child before I came to Australia, actually. 'I knew there was a chance while I was here she would pass on. But I don't believe that anyone ever leaves us. I think her soul is still around and I feel it very much so. 'And it is interesting, one soul is coming into the world another soul is departing. I said on my Instagram post if there is a waiting room for the coming and going, I hope grandma kisses the soul on the forehead.' Katybroke the news of hergrandmother's passing on Twitter on Monday morning, just days after she announced she was expecting her first child with actor fiancÃ© Orlando Bloom, 43. Sharing a link to a choral version of Deep Peace, she wrote: 'a song for Grandma. May she rest in deep peace. Ann Pearl Hudson'. The Teenage Dream hit-maker later uploaded a black and white video to Instagram, showing herself sitting by her grandmother's bed in hospital, telling her the special news just before her sad passing. She says: 'Grandma, it's Katy. I just wanted to tell you, I know you're not feeling well, but I wanted to share some exciting news with you. 'I'm going to tell you that I'm going to have a baby. I'm pregnant, Grandma! 'Katy is finally pregnant, she's the last one, but I have a baby inside me and I wanted to tell that to you.' Katy also took to Instagram to share a moving message in tribute to her 'fighter' grandmother. She posted: 'I don't know when a soul enters a new vehicle but if there is an afterlife where there's a waiting room of the coming and going my mind wonders if the soul that is waiting to come into my world is getting a kiss on the forehead from my sweet Grandma that departed this earth yesterday. My heart hopes so. 'If she is able to speak with the soul in waiting the conversation would probably include 'are sure you wanna pick this wild group?!' There would be most definitely be some sarcasm, a witty quip or two... 'To be honestgrandma probably had a glass of her favorite blush wine ready upon arrival to this afterlife... and a most fashionable look, jewels included, naturally. 'A lot of what I am is because of my father... and he is because of her. She started it all, as she used to remind us and I'm so grateful she did. 'Family... is there to show us what love can be... sometimes that journey of finding the love is tough to get to AND through but if you can open your heart and let the light lead the way you will find that incomparable love. 'Ann Pearl Hudson was a fighter. She survived the Great Depression, raised 3 kids on her own as a seamstress, making G strings for showgirls and other such characters in Vegas. 'She was always authentically herself, funny and full of all the sweet cozy things you think of when you think of grandmas. 'She gave me crisp dollar bills in hallmark cards, she let us eat her favorite almond cookies from the 99 cent store while we asked questions about the different fans she had on display on her walls. 'She was a great grandma and I will forever carry some of her in me. 'When my wit comes out, that's Ann. When my authenticity comes out, that's Ann. When my stubbornness comes out, hell, that's Ann. When my fighter spirit comes out, that's Ann. When my style comes out, that's Ann. 'May she rest in deep peace and kiss the forehead of the soul to come and let them know everything is gonna be okay, especially now that they have gained an angel to look over them,' Katy concluded. The star's sassy grandmother became extremely popular with fans after appearing in her 3D concert film Part Of Me. She had earned a legion of admirers for her quick-witted replies and sarcastic sense of humour displayed in the fly-on-the-wall tour documentary. The superstar is currently in Australia, where she performed at the Women's Cricket World Cup Final in Melbourne. The pop star announced her pregnancy last Wednesday, showing off her bump in her new music video Never Worn White. It is the first child for Katy and British actor Orlando, who has a son, Flynn, nine, with former model Miranda Kerr. Katy and Orlando first started dating in early 2016, but split in February 2017. The couple reconciled in April 2018, and the Pirates of the Caribbean star popped the question in a romantic Valentine's Day proposal the following year. "

Anayeli DominguezPena, 25, was chargedwith making criminal threats, perjury, internet/electronic impersonation and six counts of filing a false police report. According to a release from the La Verne Police Department, police had been investigating a series of racist incidents that had taken place at the University of La Verne. The first altercation was reported on February 28 of last year and authorities had been monitoring nine other incidents connected to the school. Most of the threats were directed to students at the university, specifically one student group on campus. DominguezPena was one of the leaders of the student group that was reportedly threatened. 'At one point, the threats escalated to a point where the University of La Verne cancelled classes for a day to ""reset"" and deal with the threats,' police said, referring to a March incident last year where DominguezPena reported that someone had lit a backpack in her car. Police responded to an incident in May where DominguezPena was found lying on the ground. At the time, she claimed to have been assaulted by a masked man. The other threats were made electronically via emails or texts. DominguezPena is said to have used a logo of a fraternity on campus in the threats, also insinuating that the president of the fraternity was associated with the threats. No evidence was found that linked the fraternity to the crimes. Police determined that DominguezPena acted alone as one of the other victims reportedly involved in one of the incidents was a student leader in the group that the woman was a part of. The victim did not have any knowledge of DominguezPena's behavior. DominguezPena is currently booked in the Los Angeles County Jail system. She is being held on $200,000."
72,A McFlurry of punches! Two customers brawl over sweet and sour sauce at a New York McDonald's - with the winner flooring his opponent while still holding his drink,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095683/Man-white-jacket-repeatedly-floors-opponent-brawl-SAUCE-New-York-McDonalds.html,"This is the shocking moment two men get into a ridiculous fight over sweet and sour sauce inside a McDonald's. The video was filmed in one of the fast food chain's outlets New York's Lower East Side before being posted on Facebook, where it has been viewed five million times. It shows two men - one in a white jacket and the other wearing a red durag on his head - squaring up to each other after trading insults. The video begins with the pair trash-talking each other as they gradually begin to square off, mimicking boxers as they bob side-to-side. A couple of punches are thrown as they continually trash-talk one another. The man wearing a durag then throws a punch at his opponent, who expertly dodges and returns with a right hand to the face. The entire time he is clutching his McDonald's food bag as well as a drink, but still has the upper-hand in the brawl and knocks his opponent down a three times. But the man wearing the durag refuses to give up and gets back up each time he falls the floor. On the last occasion he ends up off of his feet, the victorious white-coated man leaves the outlet with his food. One commentator said: 'This is one of the funniest fights I ever seen. One hand, holding a soda and big mac whilst wearing church shoes. Another wrote: 'God DAMN he didn't even spill a drop of the Dr. Pepper.' The man who posted the video, Justin Warren, said the fight began after an argument over sweet and sour sauce."
73,Tekashi 6ix9ine's release date confirmed for August 2020 - 12 months after pleading guilty to nine federal charges,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8093559/Tekashi-6ix9ines-release-date-confirmed.html,"A release date has been set for imprisoned rapper Tekashi6ix9ine. A spokesperson from the Bureau Of Prisons' Public Affairs department confirmed the date to the publication, writing via email, '[W]e can confirm, Inmate Hernandez has a projected release date of August 2, 2020.' Additionally, Tekashi's legal representative Lance Lazzaro confirmed to Complex the date was accurate via text message. Tekashi, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, has served 15 months of his two-year sentence, which he received after pleading guilty tofederal racketeering, drug and weapons charges, and testifying against fellow gang members. Overall, Tekashi pleaded guilty to nine federal charges. The rapperstill has months to go before his anticipated release from prison, but he already is said to be making plans for the future, with his personal security topping his priorities list. After regaining freedom, Hernandez plans to move out of Brooklyn, where he was born and raised, and relocate to another state, asTMZ reported back in February. The gossip site claimed, citing unnamed sources, that it is the rapper intends to outfit his new home with 'Fort Knox-like security' and hire a team of bodyguards to protect him from anyone seeking to retaliate against him for cooperating with prosecutors. Hernandez is reportedly interested in security guards with law enforcement or military backgrounds, and no prior gang affiliations. It might prove a tall order for the artist and Instagram star to find people willing to protect him, after some of his former bodyguards have publicly said that no amount of money is worth risking their lives.  Under the conditions of his sentence, the US Probation and Pretrial Services System will have to approve Hernandez's living arrangements and monitor his movements post-release. The rapper is said to be eager to return to the studio and resume making music as part of his existing $10million record deal, but he will not be performing live anytime soon due to safety concerns. Despite repeatedly expressing fear that someone may try to kill him for informing on Bloods gang members, Hernandez has rejected the idea of entering the federal witness protection program, where he would have been given a new identity. Two weeks ago, a federal judge rejected Hernandez's plea to serve the remainder of his sentence at home after he argued that he was a target inside the prison. The 23-year-old is locked up at a secret facility but his lawyer argued he should at least be moved to a community correctional facility because the Nine Trey Gangster Bloods street gang has a presence at his current jail. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said the sentence was meant to 'reflect the seriousness of his crimes,' even as he praised the rapper's cooperation as 'game'-changing' and 'brave.' Before offering prosecutors information that led to the convictions of gang members Aljermiah Mack and Anthony Ellison, Hernandez faced a minimum of 37 years in prison. Hernandez's role in convicting the Bloods members was 'not only substantial, it was extraordinary,' Assistant US Attorney Michael Longyear told the Associated Press. 'He was truthful. He was forthcoming. He was an open book.' Longyear noted that Hernandez's testimony helped authorities identify and convict other gang members, putting his life in danger. 'Forever, in the government's view, he will have to look over his shoulder,' Longyear said."
74,Goop has a chief scientist! MIT biochemist says that not everything published on Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness site is 'perfect' and reveals she has cracked down on wild 'unsubstantiated claims',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094141/Goop-MiT-biochemist-researches-companys-products-ideas.html,"Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness and lifestyle brand Goop has been plagued for years with criticism over its questionable science, but now a MIT biochemist is with the company and says while it's not 'perfect', she's cracking down on unsubstantiated ideas. Goop has been criticized in the past for promoting questionable items in the name of health and wellness including vaginal rose quartz eggs, crystal water bottles, vampire repellent and a vibrator necklace. Still the company, which surpassed $250million in valuation in 2018, is only growing and broke into TV with a Netflix series that aired in January. In June 2018, Goop hired Gerda Endemann, a MIT-educated researcher with a PhD in nutritional biochemistry, to help the company ground their articles and products in fact as the senior director for science and research. 'Iâ€™m a scientist and a science advocate. And I do not hate Goop,' she said in an interview with Undark. 'Iâ€™m not saying that every single thing that would have been ever published at Goop that Iâ€™ve even seen â€” I think is perfect. But I think itâ€™s fun,' she added. She was working in the dietary supplement industry when Goop hired her to do research into their wellness products. 'A colleague Iâ€™ve worked with recruited me at that point to Goop. This was about a year and a half ago. They were just building up a science and research expertise,' Endemann said. 'Goop needed â€” wanted to have more science and science expertise. Theyâ€™d grown from a very small company with a certain focus and were expanding more into wellness products and even supplements and were very eager to have â€¦ science expertise. 'And so, when I first joined I was involved somewhat in product development, but primarily in claim substantiation â€” just helping people understand what was true, what wasnâ€™t, what did we know, what didnâ€™t we know, what should we say, what shouldnâ€™t we say?' Endemann said. She reveals in a typical day she reviews material for scientific accuracy and raises red flags to ideas and products that might need a rethink. When she's not sharing reviews, she writes science-based articles for the Goop website. 'We are writing science-based articles that provide well-researched information about diseases and health conditions. What weâ€™re aiming for is to be the kind of best friend, scientist you wish you had when, for example, a parent might develop Alzheimerâ€™s disease,' she said. Endemann said it's more important than ever for Goop to have a real scientist behind in glossy doors and be 'transparent' about the products and ideas it's pushing. 'I think, all along, Goop really just wants to be transparent about providing all sorts of alternative therapies and new ways of thinking to people, but they definitely want to be transparent about the status of any one recommendation or therapy,' Endemann said. 'I think I was brought in as part of an effort just to say we need more â€” we really want more help doing this, we really want more expertise doing this,' she added. 'This is just a preliminary idea that you might be interested in. On the other hand, hereâ€™s something thatâ€™s really supported by science.' When asked about Goop's critics who say the company has offered fake health tips and information based on pseudoscience, she said that because of Paltrow's public profile the company has been an 'easy target' for haters. 'It just seems so bizarre to me that Goop is picked on so much, because we are truly better about our claims than 90 percent of the companies out there. There are so many companies that sell products, and thereâ€™s so many whacky therapies that just make outrageous claims. You see them constantly. And this is nowhere in that category, nowhere near as bad,' she added. She said that as a scientist she enjoys researching the new ideas that Goop floats. Sometimes, she says, the hate is unwarranted. 'What I have seen is scientists, medical doctors saying, trying to act as if Gwyneth talking about gluten-free diets is wacky. Gluten-free diets are not wacky. There is more and more scientific evidence that people are intolerant of not just gluten, but other proteins in wheat. So I think that a lot of that criticism â€” possibly not all â€” but a lot of that criticism, itâ€™s just unfounded and unfair.' She says that Goop has been honest about making mistakes in the past in marketing products and ideas - and is trying to avoid making more in the future. 'As Gwyneth herself has said, there have been a few mistakes, a few times where things were stated where it wasnâ€™t clear that maybe this was not well substantiated,' she admitted. 'But I think our readers are interested in this material. They hopefully know that, that we have a very good system now for vetting our claims, and hopefully, they are comfortable with how we present material,' she added. Now the website includes special tags on its website to make it plain to readers what is an idea based on science and what's just a wacky idea. She says now Goop tries to be active in educating their readers about risks surrounding some alternative therapies. 'We will say, ""Thereâ€™s one small study on this. You know, itâ€™s suggestive, itâ€™s interesting, but donâ€™t change your behavior based on that,""' she said."

The pictures have been taken over 16 years by photographer Zach Bradley, who grew up in the 25,000-square-mile desert. He has discovered abandoned cars, empty house and eerie cemeteries while exploring the harsh environment. The 35-year-old, who grew up in Barstow, California - which lies on Route 15 between LA and Las Vegas - but now lives in Henderson, Nevada, says that the desert often gets a 'bad rap' for being forlorn. He says that in reality, it is full of 'cool and interesting places' and is thriving with plant life. He told MailOnline Travel: 'The desert is a beautiful eco-system with Joshua trees, cactus and wildflowers. You can't beat it. 'I love the Mojave Desert because I grew up here. As a kid, I loved going out into the desert and playing. My parents used to prospect for a hobby, so we'd always go camping. I was also in the Boy Scouts, which emphasized the importance of nature. 'When I was about 19 I bought a Nikon N55 film camera on clearance. Since then that is the only camera I have ever shot with besides an old Polaroid camera I got at a thrift store. From there, I just started exploring the desert and shooting as much as possible.' And the most intriguing place he's discovered on his desert travels? A pet cemetery. He explained: 'The Boulder City Pet Cemetery, also called the Eldorado Valley Pet Cemetery, might be one of the coolest and most interesting places I've stumbled across. 'It is a rogue pet cemetery with very little information regarding its founding, but the place is heartbreaking and beautiful. 'Also there are many art exhibits that are just kind of placed in the desert like The International Car Forest in Goldfield or The Claim Your Destiny Beer Water tower. They are always cool to find when exploring. 'My personal favourite photo I have taken is the one in the Lucerne Valley of a house in a field of tall yellow grass. 'I waited for about a half-hour for the sun to come up to get that first light hitting it. It was pretty cold because it was late October.' 'There is a safety aspect to exploring the Mojave. 'Not only should you bring plenty of water but you also need to watch for snakes and be aware of your surroundings - there are open mine shafts and dilapidated buildings that might not be safe to enter.'"

She defines a posh accent as having three elements: clear pronunciation of the letter H at the beginning of words such as 'hat' and 'hamper', making the R inaudible in words such as 'car' and 'heart' andlong vowels, which require an incredibly high palate. Here, FEMAIL reveals the best quotes from The Crown to extend your vowels and skip certain inaudible letters in words, so you can trick strangers and colleagues into thinking you're practically royal. 'Who we are is not what we wear or what glitters. It's the spirit that defines us' Season 2, Episode 9 - 'Paterfamilias' Claire said: 'This line from Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh, won't just help you mimic the pride that comes with royal duty. 'It's a sentence to use when practicing your long vowels, and skipping your 'r's.' 'Monarchy is God's sacred mission to grace and dignify the earth. To give ordinary people an ideal to strive towards, an example of nobility and duty to raise them in their wretched lives. Monarchy is a calling from God.' Season 1, Episode 4 - 'Act of God' Claire said: 'We all know that half of being 'posh' stems from your attitude. 'To really wrap your head around the Royal attitude, try practicing your Queen's English by mimicking this line from Queen Mary. 'One thing that you will have to wrap your head around when impersonating a royal is their sense of duty and obligation towards their life-affirming role. 'This quote, from Queen Mary, should help you to channel a royal mindset, and will help you practice skipping the ""r"" sounds in words like monarchy.' 'He hasn't found happiness... He's found marriage â€“ the very opposite of happiness'. Season 2, Episode 7 - 'Matrimonium' Claire said: 'This is the perfect phrase, delivered with great sarcasm by Antony Armstrong-Jones, for practicing using hard 'H's at the beginning of words. 'It also gives a taste of the slightly stiff, pragmatic way in which the aristocracy once approached marriage.' 'When is it, do you think, if one's committed to a life of honesty, that one must start calling oneself 'middle-aged'?' Season 2, Episode 8 - 'Dear Mrs. Kennedy' Claire said:This phrase from Queen Elizabeth is a fine example of how 'one' should be used. 'One' is a pronoun used to refer to the self, particularly in posh circles, and is also another opportunity to practice your long vowels.' 'The pusillanimity and vindictiveness knows no limits. Seventeen years have elapsed since the abdication. Shouldn't bygones be bygones?' Season 1, Episode 5: Smoke and Mirrors Claire said: 'The British aristocracy is known for pursuing a 'proper' education, so using elaborate words is another way to practice your BRP. 'This quote â€“ from David Windsor â€“ allows you to do just that, along with practicing a royal buzzword: abdication.' 'It is better to be patient and get what you desire in the right time, than have high office thrust upon you when you are not ready.' Season 1, Episode 2: Hyde Park Corner Claire said: This quote, from Season 1, will allow you to really practice that 'ah' sound, and to emphasise your 't's. 'This will help you to sound and feel like a royal as you philosophise about your regal duty and understand what it means to wear the weight of the Crown. 'Would you like to know the principle, perhaps only advantage, of being the Chief Patron of the English Bowling Association? My fellow patrons are frequently too old or too ill to meet.' Season 2, Episode 1 - Misadventure Claire said: 'This quote, from Queen Elizabeth in the early seasons, allows you to get used to the royal vocabulary with 'posh' terms like patrons, frequently, and perhaps. 'It also allows for plenty of 'oo' sounds and will keep you practicing those lengthened vowels.' 'Look, I'm strong. You know that. And I can cope with the truth. I just demand to know the truth. It's when people don't tell me the truth that I can't bear it.' Season 2, Episode 10 â€“ Mystery Man Claire said: 'This dramatic statement, delivered by Queen Elizabeth, is the perfect way to practice your high 'oo' sound in the word truth, which should sound more like 'trooth' in this sentence. 'You can also practice skipping your 'r's and sharpening your 't's, to sound like a very well-spoken truth-seeker.' "
77,"Get it while it's hot! Dyson launches a cordless HAIR STRAIGHTENER that it says will make locks 'smooth, shiny and glossy' in SECONDS while reducing damage by 50% - but is it worth the $500 price tag?",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8095681/Introducing-Dyson-Corrale-Tech-giant-launches-new-500-hair-straightener.html,"17 months after the sell-out success of its revolutionary Airwrap hair tool, tech giant Dyson is hoping to shake up the industry once again with the release of its first ever hair straightener - a $500 product that it claims can reduce heat damage by 50 per cent. The Dyson Corrale was launched on Tuesday morning, with founder James Dyson revealing that the $499.99 tool uses 'unique flexing plates of magnesium copper' that 'adapt to the shape of the hair tress', resulting in quicker, more efficient straightening. 'This means that we get an enhanced style and without excessive heat damage,' he explained, while revealing that the brand spent 'almost a decade' - and $129 million - researching the science of straightening before launching the Corrale tool. Addressing the world via a live video feed from Paris - after a planned launch event was cancelled in light of the coronavirus outbreak - Dyson explained the importance of the tool's flexible copper plates, noting that they are designed to 'wrap around the tress' which means more even pressure is applied to each hair. 'We discovered that if the plates could conform to the precise profile of the tress, then with each pass we could apply the correct tension to all the hair strands,' he said. 'This means that we get an enhanced style and without excessive heat damage. We simply do not need the heat that others apply.' 'The Dyson Corrale straightener features pioneering microhinged plate technology, which flex to shape and gather hair, applying even heat and tension to all the hair strands in every pass and keeping them perfectly aligned, reducing the reliance on heat,' the brand added in a statement. Dyson's straightener offers three heat settings -330Â°F, 365Â°F, and 410Â°F - which users can choose between depending on their preferred style and hair type. 'This adaptability, combined with the increased control provided by the flexing plates, allows users to style at lower temperatures without compromising on the results,' the brand explained. Comparing the Corrale to other flat irons on the market, the brand explained how its flexible plates help to not only protect hair, but to make the straightening process easier. It noted that 'flat plate straighteners' only apply heat to the thickest parts of the hair, which means that some thinner strands are not being straightened when you pass the tool along your tresses. This means that users typically have to run the tool through their hair multiple times 'by which time excessive heat has been applied to the tress, which causes reduction in hair strength, gloss and color'. The Corrale's manganese copper alloy plates feature a six metal blend, which the brand says allows for 'optimum flexibility, strength and thermal conduction', while adding that each plate has been 'precision machined to 65 microns' - the width of the average human hair. Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner's long-time stylist Jen Atkin - a Dyson brand ambassador - joined the live feed from Paris to offer her professional thoughts on the tool, which she praised for not only helping to reduce damage but making the styling process easier. 'The Corrale measures the temperature up to 100 times a second,' she explained, noting that the tool minimizes damage by adjusting the heat required to straighten the hair. And when it comes to styling, Atkin says that the Corrale won't just make straightening the hair easier for people at home - she insists that when it comes to creating the perfect beach wave, the tool's flexible plates will leave you with a more natural style. 'Because of the flexible plates you don't get that annoying indentation that you get with other flat irons,' she explained. To increase the ease and efficiency of the straightening process, Dyson also chose to make its new tool cord-free, explaining that it used the same technology found in its popular vacuum cleaners for the cordless design. 'Powered by a four-cell lithium-ion battery, the Dyson Corrale straightener delivers the same thermal performance of a corded product with the cord-free versatility and universal voltage allowing users to style anywhere, anytime,' a statement explained. The tool takes 70 minutes to fully charge, however this provides just 30 minutes of usage - although Akin insists that this is more than enough time to straighten a full head of hair. She added that she finds the recharging dock actually serves as a perfect place to rest the tool while you adjust the hair, so it can charge while you style. Its power cord features a magnetic attachment, meaning you can keep it plugged in as you style if the battery is not fully charged by the time you are ready to straighten your hair. The Corrale also comes complete with a flight mode feature, which means it can be packed safely in hand luggage. Dyson's latest hair launch comes 17 months after the October 2018 release of its Airwrap, a revolutionary tool that both dried and curled the hair at the same time. When the British-based appliance brand first launched the Airwrap- which costs between $499 and $549 - it sold out within a few days as people around the world seized upon the chance to try the innovative tool. The tool's popularity then sparked an online black market community on eBay with people now selling Airwraps for hundreds of dollars more than retail price to capitalize on the product being sold out everywhere. The Dyson Airwrap comes with three different attachment options: the 'complete' styler, which includes all six available attachments, and the 'smooth and control' and the 'volume and shape' stylers, which each come with four. Prior to launching the Dyson Airwrap, the company - which was previously known for its vacuums and fans - created the Supersonic Hair Dryer, and it flew off the shelves at $400 per unit. But while the hair dryer was certainly impressive, Dyson upped the ante with the Airwrap - a styling tool that possesses the ability to curl, wave, smooth, and dry hair using air instead of heat, which is intended to protect your hair against the damage caused by so many other styling tools. The popularity of the product was no doubt given a hefty boost by Atkin, who told the New York Timesof the new tool that she predicted it would 'break the internet' - just as her famous client Kim has done on many an occasion. 'My reaction was, like, this is so incredible,' she added when discussing her first thoughts on the new tool, before adding in a statement: 'With the Dyson Supersonic, Dyson changed the game on hair drying and gave people a great smooth finish without extreme heat. 'Now Dyson is bringing that same approach to a tool that helps people achieve a variety of styles on a variety of hair types. 'With the Dyson Airwrap, everyone is basically their own stylist.' Dyson added: 'We have been obsessively manipulating airflow for more than 25 years. It is one of our core expertise. 'Harnessing the power of Dysonâ€™s digital motor we have engineered a truly unique styling tool preventing extreme heat damage when styling. Iâ€™m immensely proud of what our engineers have achieved.' This then generates a 'high velocity jet of hair' which shoots out of six different gaps around the barrel to create a 'physical phenomenon known as the 'Coanda effect', which essentially means that the hair is drawn in as if by a vacuum, and then wrapped automatically around the barrel. In other words - you don't need to manually wrap your hair around the tool when styling it, making the process much less tiresome. If you're using one of the other product attachments, like the smoothing brush, the same effect applies; their hair will be drawn into the attachment in order to get the best results. And unlike many other styling tools, which rely on heat in order to achieve results, the Dyson Airwrap relies on air. This means that the tool can be used on damp hair, and not only saves you from having to spend extra time drying your locks before straightening or curling them, but also protects your locks from the additional damage that can be caused by using heat-based styling tools. When I put the tool to the test, it certainly lived up to all of the promises made about its powers - to a certain extent. The product is incredibly easy to use, and despite my initial fears about my hair being sucked into the tool and potentially ripped out of my scalp, the wrapping effect works very well. I love the fact that you can use it on damp hair, mostly because I'm too lazy to ever blow dry my own hair. Sorry. The lack of heat also appeals to me, because my hair tends to get incredibly dry and frizzy whenever it comes into contact with heat. As far as ease of use, I found every attachment incredibly easy to get to grips with - even the curler, which whizzes around to suck in your hair and curl it, using warm hair to start, then sealing the curl with a shot of cool air. The only downside to the product - other than the fairly impressive price tag - is the longevity of the style, which I found didn't quite hold up to my standard hot curling iron. However, this may well be a problem that is easily solved with an extra few squirts of hairspray. All in all, I think the product is really impressive - and I'm not the only one who thinks so. In addition to celebrity hairstylist Jen's resoundingly-positive review, the tool is getting a huge amount of delighted feedback from fans online. 'Love the results every time- transforming my fine poker straight hair into a soft beach wave in less than 15 minutes!' one Instagram user wrote, while another added: 'One hair tool that can do everything! I mean everything! 'Dry your hair, give it body, create volumous luscious curls - and keep your hair shiny and healthy in the process.'"
78,"Golfer Paige Spiranac, 26, reveals she has been accused of 'ruining the sport' by flaunting her CLEAVAGE in low-cut tank tops - and complains that she is treated like an outsider for being 'real'Â ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8093205/Golfer-Paige-Spiranac-26-says-shes-accused-ruining-game-sexy-clothes.html,"American golfer Paige Spiranac says she has been accused of 'ruining the game' because she wears low-cut tank tops that show off her cleavage. The 26-year-old has 2.2 million Instagram followers and also hosts thePlaying A Round Podcast, and in a recent episode she complained about how she is treated because of the way she looks and dresses. Paige said that she's called a 'sl**' and a 'w****'because she wears tank tops, and revealed that it's even cost her opportunities to help out with charities. According to News.com.au, Paige said that golf his full of 'hypocrisy,' since everyone 'is just playing this part of this perfect golfer when in reality itâ€™s nothing like that.' But because she refuses to play along â€” and prefers to wear skintight outfits that flaunt her figure â€” she is looked down upon. 'I wear a tank top and Iâ€™m the s'** and Iâ€™m the w**** and Iâ€™m the one thatâ€™s ruining the game,' she said. It's not that her outfit choices have stopped her from playing. Paige playedat the University of Arizona and San Diego State University, and even won All-Mountain West Conference honors during two seasons. She's also relayed her success and social media following into sponsorship deals. But it's cost her in other ways. She said that recently, she wanted to help out with a charity that gave kids free golf clubs but was turned down. 'The guy wrote back and said, ""We would love to but, because of the way our board members view you, you canâ€™t help out,""' she said. 'I want to give back to these kids who donâ€™t have anything, because I grew up not having anything, and I canâ€™t even f***ing do that because of my cleavage. 'We bond over having a common interest and we all love the same thingâ€¦ I donâ€™t understand why it matters if youâ€™re wearing a polo (shirt) and Iâ€™m not wearing a polo. 'If a guy on tour wears shorts instead of pants, the worldâ€™s not going to end. In golf, people make all of these problems so serious and itâ€™s not serious.' She went on: 'Itâ€™s like my whole life Iâ€™m trying to find a place where I can fit in and that I feel comfortable and that I feel at peace with myself and I havenâ€™t found that. 'Golf is the absolute worst place for me to be because I am the exact opposite of everything that a golfer should encompass, should be, and Iâ€™m not. 'Iâ€™m not refined, Iâ€™m raw and real and I wear what I want and I have always been so different and golf is not that way.' Paige complained to The Guardian in 2018 that people think her success is only due to how she dresses. 'Thatâ€™s unfair to me and unfair to all of my accomplishments. I probably do more community service than any other professional golfer. For people to say, ""You only show some cleavage, thatâ€™s why you have what you have,"" is unfair. Thatâ€™s the injustice that we face every day as women and I see it a lot in golf.' In another recent episode her podcast, Paige also spoke about how, in 2016, an ex shared a semi-nude photo of her with friends and it leaked online. 'I think that people thought I'd be OK with it because I do have more of, like, a sexy image. And, like, ""Oh, it's one boob, what's one boob?"" 'But they're losing the whole message behind it. The person who I am on social media is not actually who I am. 'There's a lot of stuff I do like to keep to myself, and my naked body was one of them. And that was taken away from me.'"

Multiple volunteer fire and police departments from Dutchess county and Putnam county spent hours battling the Breakneck fire in the town of Fishkill, New York yesterday. The blaze at the park was reported at approximately 2.30pm, according to Dan Keefe of the state parks department. By 9.15pm he said 'there are several fires burning within a 300-acre perimeter.' Fishkill Police Department said that unfortunately several vehicles were destroyed but all the hikers came off the mountain safely. Hiking trails in Hudson Highlands State Park were closed as a precaution 'due to fire suppression activities until further notice'. The fire in the Dutchess Junction area forced Route 9D to be closed for part of the evening on Monday and caused delays for the Metro-North Hudson line. Last night the Fishkill Police Department shared shocking photos of the incident which showed its true scale. The emergency response came after many Hudson Valley residents reported seeing smoke rising from the lower parts of the Hudson Highlands near Breakneck Ridge. According to the New York State Parks Police, this was not part of a controlled burn. Photos taken from the scene indicate that the fire may have started near a parking lot and spread to surrounding areas. Some cars in the lot also caught fire. An eyewitness at the scene of the fire also said multiple fire trucks were at on hand trying to contain the situation."

Amazing Labrador therapy dog named Magnus works out with his owner,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094861/Amazing-Labrador-named-Magnus-works-owner-acting-weight-push-ups.html,"This is the amazing moment that a Labrador therapy dog named Magnus dutifully helps his owner during his workout. The dog, 3, from New York, boasts his own Instagram account, where nearly 30,000 people keep up with his and his owner's life. Footage shows Magnus helping by acting as a weight during push ups and providing encouragement during sit ups by resting his paws on his owner's knees. The footage starts with the Labrador sitting in front of his owner's legs as he does sit ups, with both of his paws resting on his right knee. The clever dog is then seen acting as a weight by balancing on his owner's back while he does push ups. Magnus then assists with the downward-facing dog yoga manoeuvre by mirroring his owner as he presses his face to the floor while keeping his back legs straight. And then as the man does more push ups, Magnus hi-fives his left and right hands alternately as he moves upwards. Finally, the dog rests his paw on his owner's head as the man pushes his face to the floor. The video is just one of dozens on the dog's Instagram account. The social media profile also shows him in hundreds of pictures. In one, he is surrounded by cuddly toys as he sits on a chair. In another, he is seen resting his paw on the steering wheel of his owner's car, giving the impression that he is going to drive it. A third shows him lying on his back while wearing sunglasses."
81,How to 'hack' your hormones: Experts share the simple ways that you can improve your health in EVERY decade of your life,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8093283/Experts-share-simple-ways-hack-hormones-decade.html,"While you might be aware of your hormones, chances are you are not familiar with how much they control everything - from how you digest to when you sleep and your overall mood. Hormones areresponsible for much more than pregnancy cravings, menopausal hot flashes and period-induced binges - and they adjust and shift as we get older. Speaking to FEMAIL, naturopaths, nutritionists and experts from Happy Healthy You shared their top tricks for 'hacking' your hormones in every decade of your life. So what do you need to know? TWENTIES - TRACK YOUR CYCLE * If you find yourself struggling with mid-cycle pain, look at your consumption of foods which feed oestrogen like soy or alcohol. * Also, keep a close eye on things like sleep and poor diet. * Employ the 8 x 8 x 8 rule of eight hours of sleep, eight hours of work and eight hours of play. * Ditch inflammatory foods that might be causing your sluggish thyroid - such as gluten and sugar. * Try a new habit - and do it for 21 days. Observe changes in your body accordingly. * If you find you're struggling with spots, try taking a herbal supplement. Your twenties are generally a time of major change. Not only are you getting to grips with leaving full-time education, but you're likely to be leaving home, entering the workforce and changing your entire routine. Nutritionist Thalia Thomas said you need to get on top of your hormones in your twenties, because this will set up good foundations for later on. 'With hormonal imbalance becoming increasingly triggered by external factors (such as stress, diet or harmful chemicals), it's imperative to start getting familiar with your body and how your hormones are affecting your physical and mental health for the long-term,' Tahlia told Daily Mail Australia. 'When your hormones are balanced, it means your body is working together to keep your healthy.' To start looking after your hormonal balance, the nutritionist recommends you 'monitor your body's cycle and mood shifts, recognise and make note of your triggers, and consider getting your hormones tested'. If your hormones start to become imbalanced in your twenties, then you can experience issues with concentrating, extreme fatigue, irregular periods and temperature sensitivity. THIRTIES - ADJUST YOUR DIET By the time you get to your thirties, your hormones might have changed again. This can be due to the use of contraception, stress, pregnancies and sleep or adrenal issues. 'Many women will continue with the regular menopause cycles into their mid 30s and will notice signs of hormonal imbalance, which is likely to come from stressful jobs, and higher intakes of caffeine and foods that lack nutrients,' naturopath Lauren Scinetti said. The expert recommends you address this by replenishing key micronutrients and getting into a habit of doing regular exercise. Lauren also recommends you sync your cycle with your workout, and adjust your diet a little to ensure you're getting the adequate amount of fruit and veg. 'Unfortunately, most women will experience a hormonal shift in their mid 30s,' she said. 'This is your body telling you to adjust your diet and lifestyle to work harmoniously with your hormones. 'If your hormones are imbalanced, your body will let you know - one way it will do this is by the onset of premature hormonal ageing and wrinkles. 'It's important to look at what you're putting into your body to help to nourish it for the long run.' FORTIES - MAKE TIME FOR REGULAR EXERCISE Many women say their fifth decade is the most stressful of all, when they begin to experience the start of perimenopause changes while they often deal with both family life and workplace stress. Acne Anxiety Bloating Depression Hair loss Headaches Insomnia Irregular menstrual cramps Nose bleeds Weight gain 'Perimenopause is when your body starts to transition into the menopause, which is the time when a woman stops having her menstrual cycle for 12 consecutive months,' naturopath Sally James said. 'Hormonal imbalances can cause many symptoms of perimenopause, which include physical changes such as menstrual fluctuations, weight gain, night sweats, hot flashes and changes in libido. 'It can also cause emotional symptoms which include anxiety, mood swings, difficulty concentrating and fatigue.' To take your hormones in hand at this point, Sally said it's a good idea to pay close attention to your metabolism and up your leafy greens. No matter how busy you are, she also said it's vital to participate in regular exercise - whether that be yoga or running. FIFTIES - START SUPPLEMENTING When it comes to your fifties, nutritionist Rachel Enright said you can 'ease and reduce' symptoms of the menopause by tweaking various aspects of your lifestyle. 'Menopause causes a lot more than hot flashes,' she said. 'It often affects your libido, causes vaginal dryness, insomnia and often creates feeling of depression and anxiety. 'Understanding your hormonal levels can help ease and reduce symptoms, so it's important to eat lots of nutrient-rich foods, stay active and alkaline, and take natural supplements where necessary.' A multivitamin or some sort of menopause relief can be good here."
82,Pensioner with Alzheimer's recovers from coronavirus aged 100 after medics took blood from other cured patients and transferred it into him,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095195/Pensioner-Alzheimers-recovers-coronavirus-aged-100-using-blood-cured-patients.html,"A 100-year-old coronavirus patient suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s has recovered after being treated with blood donated by former patients. The Chinese centenarian, known by his surname Wang, has other underlying health conditions including high blood pressure and heart failure, according to Chinese media. He was among more than 80 patients who were discharged last Saturday from Hubei Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital in Wuhan. Mr Wang received two therapy sessions using blood donated by recovered patients, said Cai Chen, a doctor from the hospital. 'Considering the patient was very old and he had a relatively weak immune system, we decided to use recovered coronavirus patient's blood plasma as the main treatment,' Cai Chen told the press. Scientists believe the treatment works, in theory, by putting disease-fighting proteins from recovered patients into people still battling the illness. The sick patients' bodies can then use these proteins â€“ called antibodies â€“ as if they were there own, instead of having to make them from scratch. Chinese hospitals have said they are using the therapy already but only on their patients â€“ there is no mass-produced drug or supply of it. The former patient, who had just celebrated his 100th birthday, was diagnosed with the coronavirus on February 24. He was unconscious when he was admitted to the hospital, Zeng Li, director of the hospital's infection department, told the press. 'The fact that we used anti-virus blood serum [from recovered patients] to cure the centenarian is going to boost the confidence of other patients,' Zeng Li told the state broadcaster CCTV. Mr Wang's condition gradually improved after receiving two-week treatment from a designated team of medical experts. Chinese health experts have warned the elderly and people with underlying health conditions are at high risk of catching the coronavirus. As of Saturday, the Hubei hospital alone had admitted 552 patients over the age of 60, including 149 have recovered, according to reports. A drug-maker in Japan has been developing a drug using parts of the immune system taken from people who have caught the virus and recovered from it. It has been used to tackle Ebola in the past but it could take more than one recovered patient to treat a single sick person - so will not be used for everyone. News of the development comes as a health official working in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, said that if given the chance again they would have pushed to send more patients into intensive care sooner in their illness. And scientists have said they are getting close to starting human trials of vaccines, but a UK Government official said they would not be ready during this outbreak. The novel coronavirus, has infected over 114,000 people worldwide, including at least 4,062 deaths. China has recently seen a sharp drop in its new cases as Wuhan closes its last makeshift hospital built during the outbreak today. But the UK could be heading straight for a coronavirus like the one which has crippled Italy, experts have warned. Italy last night put all of its 60million people into lockdown and banned movement between cities in a drastic bid to stop COVID-19. The UK is following the same trajectory, one scientist said, and could end up in a similar situation a few weeks down the line. There are currently 321 confirmed cases in the UK and five people have died. More infections are expected to be declared later today and throughout the week. Since February 21, the number of cases in Italy has rocketed from just three to at least 9,172, while in the UK it rose from nine to 321. Plasma-derived therapy' is based on the blood plasma of people who have recovered from the coronavirus. Plasma is the liquid which carries blood cells, nutrients and hormones through the blood vessels, and makes up around half of all blood. It also carries antibodies, which are proteins the body makes to destroy bacteria or viruses when they cause an infection. If somebody has never been exposed to a virus or bacteria before â€“ as is the case for everyone who catches the coronavirus â€“ they do not have any antibodies and they become ill during the time it takes their body to make them. Injecting them with antibodies from someone who has already made them saves time and helps the patient to fight off the illness faster."
83,Former Scots nationalist leader heads to court to face attempted rape and sex assault claims on second day of trial after accuser told jury he 'pounced' and 'stripped her naked' in First Minister's residence,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095187/Alex-Salmond-heads-Edinburgh-High-Court-second-day-attempted-rape-sex-assault-trial.html,"A former Scottish Government official who has accused Alex Salmond of sexual assault suffered flashbacks following the Harvey Weinstein case, a court heard. The former first minister of Scotland is on trial at the High Court in Edinburgh over accusations of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape. The woman was first to give evidence and spoke about two alleged incidents, including one charge that the 65-year-old tried to rape her in June 2014. The woman, known as Woman H, told the court today that she began to suffer flashbacks when the MeToo movement came to prominence in late 2017 after sex abuse allegations first emerged against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. She said: 'I had started to learn about (the MeToo movement), yes. It was just around that time. 'It was on the back of the Harvey Weinstein case. 'These issues started to be discussed and I started to have what I could describe as flashbacks. 'I started to come to the realisation at the October/November 2017 period.' The woman said that no-one was 'cheerleading' her to give evidence but she had decided to speak to the police on her own. When asked if she had been encouraged to speak to the police, she said: 'There's no-one cheerleading me to do this. 'This isn't fun, I would rather not be here. 'I don't feel like I have been encouraged, I feel I have made this decision on my own.' The woman had previously told the court that she felt 'hunted' by Salmond moments before an alleged attempted rape in Bute House. It is alleged the incident took place after a dinner at the first minister's official residence. She told the court on Monday that Salmond had been touching her legs and her shirt and trying to kiss her, then blocked her path when she tried to leave. The court heard she agreed but on the condition they stayed in separate rooms, which she described as being 'a bit of an escape plan'. When she entered her room it was heard Salmond followed her in with a bottle of red wine, then 'pounced' on her, stripped himself naked, took her clothes off and pushed her on to the bed. She added: 'I felt like I was hunted. I remember feeling him on top of me. He was aroused, his private parts on top of me.' The court was then told the complainer waited for Salmond to fall asleep before she went to the bathroom. She told the court she did not give him any indication that she would welcome such contact. The woman added: 'Why would I want to go out with him? He's a much older man who didn't look after himself.' Evidence was also given about an alleged sexual assault in Bute House beforehand in May 2014. It was heard the same complainer had stayed behind to do work with Salmond when they began doing shots of a Chinese white spirit, which she described as an unusual incident. The complainer described Salmond as being 'half-cut' and that he was in a 'good mood'. The court heard he sat on the floor and asked her to sit next to him. She said: 'He was putting his hand down my top and kissing my face and neck and touching my legs. He was laughing.' It was heard she then managed to make her excuses and leave. His lawyer Gordon Jackson QC lodged a special defence of alibi for the alleged incident in May 2014. Consent was also given as a defence for three alleged sexual assaults and an alleged indecent assault against three women. Judge Lady Dorrian earlier told the jury of nine women and six men they must be 'impartial' during the trial. Salmond faces 14 charges of alleged offences against 10 women, all of which he has pleaded not guilty to. The charges span a period between June 29 2008 and November 11 2014, with one sexual assault said to have taken place in the month of the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014. Salmond - who was Scotland's first minister from 2007 to 2014 - faces a number of other sexual assault charges, as well as two indecent assault charges. His trial, which is expected to last for four weeks, continues."
84,Middle class Americans can no longer afford to get married due to huge debts as just 50 per cent now tie the knot,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094553/Americans-avoiding-marriage-achieve-financial-stability.html,"Middle class Americans are opting not to marry because until they're financially ready, according to new research that shows people value having a lot of money and a career they enjoy more than a legal union. Student loans and other debts get in the way of marriage which is nowadays regarded as a 'capstone achievement' that comes once an individual has set up for a stable future, researchers say. While 60 percent of Americans said they had been married in 2002 that dropped to 50 percent in 2017. In that same 15-year period the cohabiting figures rose from 54 percent to 59 percent, according to Pew Research. 'The meaning of marriage has changed, and marriage is now viewed as this capstone achievement once all of these other milestones have been achieved,' Susan L. Brown, chair of sociology at Bowling Green State told the Wall Street Journal. 'It's almost like a luxury good that's attainable only by the people who have the highest resources in society.' But since 1976 to 2017, three-quarters of high school seniors have responded that they see marriage in their future, according to yearly research by the University of Michigan. It indicates people are simply waiting for a number of factors to fall into place. The WSJ said the poorest Americans were least likely to marry. 'I feel like if I ever get married it would probably be because of the tax benefits, or if they really wanted to,' Nick Cotter, 31, told WSJ. 'Thatâ€™s a definite change from what my parents thought.' He graduated in 2007 then worked in a supermarket. The Pittsburgh native dropped out of college because he couldn't afford it the first time around but in 2013 graduated from Wheeling University in West Virginia. He got a masterâ€™s degree in public policy from Carnegie Mellon University and now works as a researcher for affordable housing for local government. Cotter added about his decision not to marry early on: 'When you donâ€™t feel that good about yourself, you definitely donâ€™t think other people will think that much of you.' Daniel Schneider, assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed. Schneider, who has studied marriage, told the WSJ: 'Economic conditions, even in the good economy, remain difficult for many working Americans. That is not conducive to you feeling like you could get married, or people wanting to marry you.' It appears to be backed up by figures that show the median wealth of married couples was much higher than non-married couples or single people. From 1989 to 2016, married couples aged 25 to 34 had a median wealth that ranged between $14,009 and over $32,094, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis figures showed. By comparison, the median wealth of cohabiting couples ranged between $4,889 and $9,786. It was in a similar range to single people where figures stayed between $3,676 and $13,049. In a study conducted from June 25 to July 8, 2019, the same percentage of men and women answered that being married was 'important but not essential' (54 percent). Fifty nine percent of men said being in a committed relationship was more important and 57 percent of women answered similarly. The majority of men (57 percent) said it was 'essential' they had a career they enjoyed and 39 percent said it was 'important but not essential'. A total of 46 percent of women said enjoying their job was 'essential' while 48 percent said it was 'important but not essential'. Both genders agreed that 'having a lot of money' was a priority. A total of 20 percent of men said it was 'essential', 65 percent of men said it was 'important but not essential', and 14 percent of males in the study said it was 'not important'. A slightly lower percentage of women (15 percent) said having sizable funds was 'essential' and 68 percent described bountiful finances as 'important but not essential'. Sixteen percent said it was 'not important'."

86,Pentagon awards $39.7million in contracts to three companies that will compete to build mobile nuclear reactors,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094325/Pentagon-awards-39-7million-contracts-three-companies-build-mobile-nuclear-reactors.html,"The Pentagon on Monday awarded contracts to three companies that will be tasked with building small, mobile nuclear reactors that will generate power for American troops stationed at home and abroad. The Department of Defense picked three firms - BWX Technologies of Virginia; Westinghouse Government Services of Washington, DC; and X-energy of Maryland - to design a small nuclear microreactor that can be forward deployed with US forces abroad. The three companies will compete in an engineering design competition where the prototypes will be unveiled in two years, the Pentagon announced. BWX Technologies will be paid $13.5million; Westinghouse Government Services will receive $11.9million; and X-energy will get $14.3million - all as part of a combined $39.7million investment in â€˜Project Pele.â€™ The Pentagon wants to pick a prototype that can generate in the 1-5megawatt range. If the technology is perfected, it would enable the Pentagon to deliver energy to soldiers in remote locations without having to bear the burden of using costly infrastructure. The project â€˜involves the development of a safe, mobile and advanced nuclear microreactor to support a variety of Department of Defense missions such as generating power for remote operating bases,â€™ said Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Robert Carver. â€˜After a two-year design-maturation period, one of the companies funded to begin design work may be selected to build and demonstrate a prototype.â€™ â€˜The Pele Programâ€™s uniqueness lies in the reactorâ€™s mobility and safety,â€™ said Dr. Jeff Waksman, Project Pele program manager. â€˜We will leverage our industry partners to develop a system that can be safely and rapidly moved by road, rail, sea or air and for quick set up and shut down, with a design which is inherently safe.â€™ The deployment of small, mobile nuclear reactors would â€˜enable [military] units to carry a nearly endless clean power supply, enabling expansion and sustainment of operations for extended periods of time anywhere on the planet.â€™ Project Pele is being managed under the auspices of the Strategic Capabilities Office. â€˜The United States risks ceding nuclear energy technology leadership to Russia and China,â€™ said SCO Director Jay Dryer. â€˜By retaking technological leadership, the United States will be able to supply the most innovative advanced nuclear energy technologies.â€™ One advantage of using microreactors is that military bases that are hooked up to the civilian energy grid could continue to generate power if the grid is compromised. But others say that the mobile reactors could pose a safety risk especially if radioactive fuel is brought into battlefield conditions. â€˜Fielding these reactors without commanders fully understanding the radiological consequences and developing robust response plans to cope with the aftermath could prove to be a disastrous miscalculation,â€™ Edwin Lyman, the head of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Defense News."
87,Four security guards at Dresden's Royal Palace are suspected of involvement in the heist which saw thieves make off with nearly $1.3BILLION in antique jewels,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094013/Four-security-guards-Dresdens-Royal-Palace-suspected-involvement-jewellery-raid.html,"Four security guards working at Dresden's Royal Palace are under investigation for their suspected involvement in the biggest jewellery heist since the Second World War. Germany was left in shock when priceless treasures including three sets of diamonds thought to be worth â‚¬1bn were whisked from the Green Vault of the museum in an early morning raid after a fire cut power to the building. Investigators have long suspected the robbers had inside knowledge of the layout of rooms where the treasures were kept and the museum's 'Fort Knox-like' security system. Two security guards who were on duty in the early hours of November 25, when the raid was carried out, are suspected of helping the thieves as they did not confront the robbers, the Guardian reports. They also called police to report the robbery instead of pressing a panic alarm, possibly costing valuable time and allowing the burglars to escape in a getaway car. A third guard, who was arrested on November 29, is thought to have passed on information about the museum's floor-plan and security measures. And a fourth guard is suspected of meddling with the alarm system, enabling the thieves to smash open the cases containing the glittering jewels unhindered. The suspects have 'behaved cooperatively', chief prosecutor Jurgen Schmidt told Bild newspaper, and 'initially said they wanted to speak to investigators, but subsequently they reserved their right to silence'. Seven people are thought to have been involved in the robbery. Museum directors have previously described the thought of thieves having inside knowledge as the 'worst thing imaginable'. They have appealed to them not to break up the stolen items - three jewellery sets commissioned by Saxony's former ruler Augustus the Strong as a show of power. However, experts fear the objects have already been destroyed as they are too recognisable to be sold on the open market. However, The Dresden White Diamond and the breast star of the Polish Order of the White Eagle both briefly resurfaced in January after they were offered to an Israeli security firm through the dark net for Â£7.9million. After disabling the building's power supply with a fire at a junction box, the thieves broke in through a window. Under cover of darkness they cracked open the display cases with axes before making off with the jewels. Police said they were called at 4.59am and arrived within minutes, but the burglars had already left in an Audi A6. Picking through the wreckage, state museum director Marion Ackermann said that diamond-encrusted shoe buckles and buttons, the queen's pearl necklaces and a diamond-studded sword had been left behind. 'The cabinets are not empty', she said, voicing the hope that some of the stolen items may yet be found. The lost treasures have been likened to the 'crown jewels' of Saxony, and akin to the Queen's treasures kept in the Tower of London. Saxony's 18th-century ruler Augustus the Strong competed with French monarch Louis XIV to assemble the most extravagant jewellery, museum director Marion Ackermann explained yesterday, describing the items stolen as 'state treasures of the 18th century'. Augustus, who was elector of Saxony from 1694 to 1733 and also king of Poland for much of that time, established Dresden as a cultural centre and founded the museum which was targeted on Monday. The museum also houses a 25-inch figure of a Moor studded with emeralds and a 648-carat sapphire gifted by Tsar Peter I of Russia at a meeting in 1698. Other valuable items include a jewel-studded sculpture of an Indian royal court, made out of gold, silver, enamel, precious stones and pearls. Another is a 1701 golden coffee service by court jeweller Johann Melchior Dinglinger, decorated with lounging cherubs."
88,'We can't make this stuff up!' Louisiana motorist says he hasn't renewed his vehicle registration which expired in 1997 because he has 'been busy lately',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8093307/Motorist-renewed-vehicle-registration-expired-1997-busy-lately.html,"A Louisiana man failed to renew his vehicle registration, saying he couldnâ€™t find the time - for the last 23 years. The Slidell Police Department last week posted a photograph of a motoristâ€™s long-expired license plate from 1997. When one of the departmentâ€™s officers asked the driver why he hadnâ€™t renewed his vehicle registration in more than two decades, he responded: â€˜Sorry, officer. â€˜Iâ€™ve been busy lately and totally forgot to renew my vehicle registration. â€˜I will take care of it as soon as I get home!â€™ The department was floored by the response, posting a message on Facebook with the caption: â€˜We canâ€™t make this stuff up!â€™ Authorities have not revealed the identity of the motorist. The small Louisiana town has seen at least one other bizarre incident take place within its city limits in the past few months. Last November, Slidell police released video from a surveillance camera which captured the moment a chihuahua put an SUV into reverse while the owner was busy filling up the vehicle at a gas station. Footage showed the 5-pound pet operating the SUV and police said it managed to switch gears, causing the vehicle to roll back. Video showed a woman at the pump on Gause Boulevard reacting as the vehicle backs out and glides across a four-lane highway. She is seen in the clip taking a tumble as she tries in vain to stop the car emerging into traffic whizzing by but luckily it comes to rest at a gas station directly across the street. Despite vehicles seen quickly driving by before the SUV entered the road, it avoids being hit and makes it across to the other side without a scratch. Authorities said it was a miracle that no one was seriously injured and that no other vehicles were struck during the incident. However, the owner did sustain a minor injury while trying to chase down the vehicle. It was later discovered that the dog did not have to push any pedals to get the car going. The vehicle had a mechanical issue, which allowed the transmission to change gears without anyone having to press the brake."
89,Joe Biden's brother is caught up in FBI raid of bankrupt healthcare business,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8092905/Joe-Bidens-brother-caught-FBI-raid-bankrupt-healthcare-business.html,"A healthcare company associated with James Biden, the younger brother of 2020 hopeful Joe Biden, was raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in January. And now a former executive has told Politico that the younger Biden exacerbated Americore's financial woes by trading on the ex-vice president's name and taking out a six-figure personalloan from the company's coffers. Tom Pritchard, a former Americore executive, told Politico that James Biden introduced the founder of Americore to his older brother Joe and helped the healthcare company get a bridge loan from a hedge fund. But at the same time, James Biden, took out the personal loan and suggested that the company take on greater financial liabilities. The personal loan, according to Pritchard, was never paid back. James Biden had promised Americore executives that he could bring in a large investment from the Middle East thanks to his political connections. But the cash never came, Pritchard said.  Americore is currently in bankruptcy court. Additionally, two small medical firms that did business with James Biden have claimed in civil court that they have evidence that he may have fraudulently transferred funds from Americore 'outside the ordinary course of business,' Politico reported. There's no indication that the FBI raid, which occurred on January at a hospital in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania has anything to do with James Biden. There were already mismanagement problems dogging Americore. But the Politico report adds more gas to the narrative that Joe Biden's family members were trying to enrich themselves using the Biden name. President Trump's impeachment revolved around a plot to have Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky announce an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden, since Hunter Biden had sat on the board of the Ukrainian oil company, Burisma. The president was accused of holding up around $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to exert his will. Trump has continued to maintain that Hunter Biden had no business serving on the Burisma board and was only paid money because of his family name. Senate Republicans are continuing to pursue investigations into Hunter Biden as well. James Biden's attorney did not comment to Politico. Joe Biden's campaign responded by telling the news organization that Joe and James never discussed Americore and the former vice president never expressed support for his brother's business. The founder of Americore, Grant White, attended a September 2017 fundraiser for the Beau Biden Foundation, which Joe Biden attended, the campaign divulged, but said interactions between the two men were limited. 'If the two interacted in any way, it would have been a handshake and nothing more,' the Biden campaign official told Politico."
90,Man who has spent three years tattooing his entire body turquoise insists it's helped him finally feel confident,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8094851/Former-forklift-operator-slowly-tattoos-entire-body-blue.html,"A former forklift operator has taken social media by storm after he decided to document his attempts to gradually tattoo his entire body blue. Donnie Snider, 26, from Scarborough, Ontario, who admits he's 'living life in strange-mode', was first introduced to the world of body art when hissister inked a part of his leg and foot in turquoise in 2017. Despite a series of abortive early tattoo attempts, the ink on his leg soon ignited Donnie's life's work and the social media star, who lives in a â€˜clapped-out transit busâ€™ and makes his living selling earrings, decided to use the hue to cover his body. Speaking about the comical questions he often receives from strangers Donnie said:'Questions from strangers about my genitals have increased by 10,000 per cent. Scroll down for video 'To be honest, I just like the look of it. I thought it would be neat.It's definitely striking, and I think it's a beautiful colour.' Donnie, who shares hisprogress with his 4,792 followers on the Instagram page @trism_driver, explained that he liked theplainness and simplicity of his design and chose to see through the unusual body art to keep things 'interesting'. He said:'I like the clean look â€“ unladen by symbols.There's a whimsical element. 'I thought I'd do my part to keep things interesting, maybe make someone smile. 'You've only got one life - might as well have some fun, eh?' While Donnie now chooses to embrace life and all its wonders, he admits to 'isolating' himselffor several years because he lacked confidence before he found his love of body art. He continued:'Over several years I had been isolating myself, and making efforts to tone down my less-than-pragmatic impulses, out of fear and lack of confidence â€“ and I was extremely miserable. 'After going in circles for far too long, I decided to quit hiding, break myself out of stagnation and remake my life as I'd like it to be, and redirect it to the pursuit a life I'd actually be happy to live.' The Instagram user said he had received an array of comments from users on social media, with some admiring his work of art and others clearly 'not thrilled' about his choice of tattoo. Donnie said:'I get all kinds of comments and reactions when I'm out. Some people love the tattoo, others are clearly not thrilled about it. 'The questions are endless, and many people are very curious â€“ I don't blame them, of course. 'I've had many bizarre interactions, as you can probably imagine â€“ I get surprised looks, unblinking stares, snarky comments, interesting comments, compliments, light-hearted jokes, mean-spirited jokes, stupid questions, odd questions, invasive questions. 'Whispers, smiles, double-takes, outright laughing, flirting, gasps, eye rolls, thumbs up, free beers, looks of disgust, strange propositions, chuckling, handshakes, people pulling at my clothes to peek underneath, high fives, looks of horror. 'Hugs, honking, shouting from cars, people asking to take pictures with me, people taking videos without asking, fist bumps, and even a couple people licking their thumbs and trying to rub the tattoo off. 'It's like living life in strange-mode.' Though Donnie is insulted from time to time, he does not let any negativity get him down. He said: 'Most insults are unimaginative and predictable. In fact, most can be lumped together in the category of 'unflattering comparisons to other things that are blue'.' However he went on to add that he does get a little riled when people assume he does notwork for a living â€“ or that he claims taxpayer assistance. He added:'I would sooner eat out of a dumpster.' Speaking about the reaction he has received from his friends, Donnie said they 'did not really talk about it' and that 'they don't notice it any more' but his mother took longer to come around to her blue son. He added that she was 'definitely annoyed at first', but 'quickly accepted blue skin as at the new normal.' 'I feel a renewed optimism about the feasibility of pursuing wild dreams,' he continued. 'I feel as if I'm slowly becoming re-energized after a protracted period of stagnation. I might become a trillionaire, or move to Mars. 'Or just carry on selling earrings and get my bus fixed up.' "

The befuddled holidaymaker staying at anIsle of Skye guest house mistook the Scottish tablet, a crumbly treat similar to fudge, left on his pillow for a bath product. When he took it in the shower to clean himself he was left underwhelmed by the confection's cleaning abilities. The man rated the Pink Guest House in Portree 9/10 on TripAdvisor but recommended the hotel change its 'soap'. He wrote: 'You have got to do something with that brown tablet bar of soap you put on each of our beds. 'Not only was it gritty and left an oily residue but disintegrated before the shower was done. I have had much better exfoliating bar scrubs.' The comical online review of the guest house was acclaimed after the guest, only known as Thomas, complained. He thought the Scottish tablet was 'gritty' and 'left an oily residue' when he used it. Thomas said the bar of Mrs Tilly's tablet 'disintegrated' before he had finished his shower. The hilarious review became an online hit with one person saying: 'Oh my god, that is priceless.' Another commented: 'This is hilarious', while others joked the tourist must have been a big hit with the local wasps. Someone else said: 'I do NOT want to know what Thomas does with Toblerone'. While another commented: 'Look, I'm an American, I've never seen or heard of that before despite trying several British sweets over the years. 'But based on the ingredients it's obviously a sweet. That and it says confection.' Tablet maker Mrs Tilly's even responded to the funny tweet. They said: 'While we are delighted to see our Famous Scottish tablet as an in-room treat in a guest house in the beautiful Skye, we would like to remind everyone that it is best to eat the deliciously indulgent sweet treat, using it as soap isn't one of our serving suggestions.' Another hotel in Inverness poked fun at the review with their own sign for guests warning them not to make the same mistake. A caution sign beside a complimentary tray of tablet reads: 'Attention!! This Scottish tablet is to be eaten and not used to clean yourself in the shower.' But Thomas said he still enjoyed his stay, adding the hotel as 'very clean' and claimed it had 'everything we needed'. The guest, who stayed for two nights last week at Portree's The Pink Guest House, wrote: 'Location and view were superb. 'Very clean and had everything we needed. 'You have got to do something with that brown tablet bar of soap you put on each of our beds. Not only was it gritty and left an oily residue but disintegrated before the shower was done!

92,Frequent flyer and self-confessed 'upgrade queen' reveals how she gets into business class on board nine out of every 10 flights she catches,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8093393/Traveller-reveals-gets-business-class-upgrades.html,"A self-confessed 'upgrade queen' has shared her best tips for landing yourself a business or first class seat without having to lie and say it's your honeymoon or anniversary. Avid traveller Julie Vulin said that her strategies have worked on nine out of every 10 flights so long as she didn't fly as part of a couple or family. From dressing the part to the exact line you should use on the check-in staff, this long-haul expert gaveEscapean insight into scoring that elusive seat. 1. Wear a 'classic' outfit It's no secret that dressing the part can go a long way in earning you points with the flight attendants, so keep your tracksuit pants for when you're seated on the plane. Instead, Julie adopts her 'LA outfit' for check-in which includes a pair of dark jeans, a plain t-shirt, jacket and pair of nice shoes - it's not over the top but still eye-catching enough to look presentable. Once you earn that upgrade you can switch out the tight jeans for relaxed trousers and remove the jacket so you're more comfortable. Julie scopes out all of the people on the counter before she approaches and ensures she chooses someone who looks like they're having a good day. If they've just had a fight with a customer over baggage or look like they're rushing around, it's not worth hassling them. Instead, wait until there is peace and calm at the counter before you get up. 2. Target a flight attendant you will 'connect' with Julie will always approach the counter to 'check' on her seat assignment and it is there that she will say: 'If the flight is crowded, don't worry, you can bump me into business or first class.' If the attendant smiles back at her Julie continues on with, 'OK, seriously, I know everyone asks, so I don't want to bother. I know you have a tough job. Have a great day.' Then she will go and sit somewhere near the counter, but not too close, and won't approach again. Most of the time that same attendant will come by and tell her she has been upgraded. 3. Make a case for needing an upgrade It's never too late to be upgraded, not even when you're already seated in economy class. Julie remembered a time when she was seated by the toilets and passengers continually banged into her seat on their way past. She chose a kindly hostess and asked if they could do anything about the problem. Moments later she was told to collect her things because she was being moved to business class for the duration of the 16-hour flight. 4. Travel during the shoulder months If you're flying during the middle of summer or over school holidays, flights are likely to be packed, making it difficult to earn your place in business. Flying 'shoulder' seasons - outside of popular times like summer and Christmas - means you're more likely to get bumped up, and flying mid-week is even better. 'Even if you don't get anything, flights and airports are generally less crowded and more civilised - and flights are less expensive,' she said. 5. Tell hotel staff you're on a much-needed getaway Show the same type of kindness you were giving the flight staff to those who work at your hotel, because they are equally likely to offer you perks. Don't tell them it's your birthday or anniversary if it's not, but instead say you're on a much-needed romantic getaway with your partner. 'I never once have not been given a room upgrade or gorgeous bottle of wine and/or a lovely platter of food, fruit, cake - you name it,' Julie said. 'Remember, unless it' s a small business the upgrade is not coming from their pocket so it's no skin off their nose.'"
93,Former CIA engineer accused of massive leak of classified information to WikiLeaks convicted on only minor counts as jury deadlocks on espionage charges,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8092247/Minor-convictions-ex-CIA-coder-hacking-tools-case.html,"A former CIA software engineer accused of stealing a massive trove of the agency's hacking tools and handing it over to WikiLeaks was convicted of only minor charges Monday, after a jury deadlocked on the more serious espionage counts against him. Joshua Schulte, who worked as a coder at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, was convicted by a jury of contempt of court and making false statements after a four-week trial in Manhattan federal court that offered an unusual window into the CIA's digital sleuthing and the team that designs computer code to spy on foreign adversaries. After deliberating since last week, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the more significant charges. They had notified U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty on Friday that they had reached consensus on two counts, but were unable to reach a verdict on eight others. After they were instructed to resume deliberations Monday, jurors sent a note saying they were ""extremely deadlocked."" One juror said as she left the courthouse that the jury was always split down the middle on the most serious counts, although the jury was composed of only 11 people after one juror was dismissed last week when she told the panel she had come across news about the Schulte case before the trial. Juror Alexis Anthony said she never thought the evidence was strong enough to convict Schulte of espionage-related charges. ""For me, I never felt the burden of proof was proved,"" she said. Prosecutors portrayed Schulte as a disgruntled software engineer who exploited a little-known back door in a CIA network to copy the hacking arsenal without raising suspicion, in what was said to be the largest leak in CIA history involving classified information. It was only after the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks published the so-called Vault 7 leak in 2017 - nearly a year after the theft - that the agency scrambled to determine how the information had been stolen. It identified Schulte, a 31-year-old originally from Lubbock, Texas, as the prime suspect. Schulte had left the agency on stormy terms after falling out with colleagues and supervisors, and prosecutors described the leak as an act of revenge. The data dump revealed CIA efforts to hack Apple and Android smartphones and even described efforts to turn internet-connected televisions into listening devices. ""These leaks were devastating to national security,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Laroche told jurors. ""The CIA's cyber tools were gone in an instant. Intelligence gathering operations around the world stopped immediately."" But the defense said the prosecution failed to present a clear case or show how they could be sure Schulte was the culprit. Even after presenting a month of testimony, 18 witnesses and more than 1,000 exhibits, ""the government still is not able to answer for you the very basic questions,"" defense attorney Sabrina Shroff told jurors. ""There are more questions now than when this trial first began."" Shroff argued that investigators could not be sure who took the data because the CIA network in question ""was the farthest thing from being secure."" ""Hundreds of people had access to it,"" she said. ""Hundreds of people could have stolen it."" The mistrial on eight counts injected new uncertainty into a complex case that had been several years in the making. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan did not immediately say whether prosecutors would retry Schulte on the most serious charges. The CIA also declined to comment. Schulte faces separate child pornography charges, but his defense team is trying to to have those counts thrown out due to what it calls ""misstatements"" the FBI made in applying for a warrant to search Schulte's New York City apartment. Prosecutors said Schulte, after being arrested in New York, attempted to leak even more classified information using a contraband cellphone that had been smuggled into the Metropolitan Correctional Center. They said he declared an ""information war"" and was ""prepared to burn down the United States government."""

Emerging studies show that our skeletons play key roles in producing a hormone that drives our fight-or-flight instincts, helps control our appetite, determines our risk of dementia â€” and can even make the difference between life and death when severe illness such as sepsis strikes. The hormone osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts, the cells responsible for building our bones. Gerard Karsenty, a professor of genetics and development who has led the latest research at Columbia University, showed that when mice are bred without the ability to produce osteocalcin, they donâ€™t get stressed or frightened. Lacking fear responses â€” previously thought to be governed by the hormone adrenaline â€” would make them easy prey as â€˜without osteocalcin, they donâ€™t react strongly to dangerâ€™, Professor Karsenty concluded in the journal Cell Metabolism last November. The professor has shown that when our brains sense a threat, they instruct our skeletons to pump osteocalcin, which is primarily produced by bone, into the blood to get us to take action. Professor Karsentyâ€™s team has also shown that osteocalcin can boost athleticism and endurance by raising the ability of our muscles and blood cells to take in glucose, fuelling us. Last year, Dutch researchers in the journal Frontiers in Endocrinology reported that osteocalcin appears to regulate healthy brain development. Lab tests found mice born lacking the hormone have smaller and less developed hippocampuses â€” areas of the brain that are crucial in forming memories. The research suggests osteocalcin also regulates the production of chemical brain messengers such as dopamine, which is involved in reward and motivation, and serotonin, which regulates mood, memory and sleep. Such evidence raises an intriguing possibility: could age-related bone degradation be contributing to cognitive decline and dementia? Dr Chris Murgatroyd, a reader in molecular neuroscience at Manchester Metropolitan University, has investigated this question in research published in the journal Age and Ageing. His 2016 study of 225 older women found that the lower a womenâ€™s blood levels of osteocalcin, the more likely she was to perform poorly in cognitive tests. â€˜Bone and cognition are strongly related,â€™ he told Good Health. â€˜Age-related reductions in bone health are seen along with deterioration in cognition.â€™ What we donâ€™t yet know is whether falling osteocalcin levels in ageing bones cause cognitive decline, or if they fall at the same time as cognition starts to fail. Dr Murgatroyd says it is possible that low osteocalcin and poor cognition are the result of low vitamin D levels. Studies have shown our vitamin D levels tend to fall as we age, not least because our skin becomes less efficient at synthesising it from sunshine. Whatever the exact associations, Dr Murgatroyd says we can help protect ourselves by getting out into the sunshine and exercising. â€˜That will help our vitamin D levels and can get us doing high-impact exercise such as walking, which strengthens bones and may preserve osteocalcin levels.â€™ U.S. scientists are also investigating how our bones may protect us against obesity-related illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. Dr Stavroula Kousteni, an associate professor of physiology and cellular biophysics at Columbia University, is leading the study of a hormone called lipocalin 2 (LCN2). Until recently, it was believed that our fat cells produced LCN2, but Dr Kousteniâ€™s studies have shown that bone osteoblasts produce 90 per cent of it. Whatâ€™s more, she reports that our skeletons release LCN2 in bursts after meals, as a â€˜stop-eatingâ€™ signal to our brains. Her study, published in the journal Nature in 2017, suggests that our skeletons treble the amount of LCN2 after meals. In experiments, mice bred without LCN2-producing bone cells developed 20 per cent more body fat and ate 16 per cent more food than normal mice. But when injected with LCN2, their feeding returned to normal. The hormone lowered their blood sugar levels and increased their insulin sensitivity. LCN2 appears to have similar benefits in humans. Dr Kousteniâ€™s team has found people with higher levels of the hormone after eating had lower body weights and blood sugar levels. Dr Kousteni has begun to test LCN2 levels in people with type 2 diabetes and reports that supplementary injections of the hormone may help with weight control. However, she adds more safety research is required. Nottingham University researchers have suggested higher levels of osteocalcin may promote the health of cells in arteries and veins. In this way, osteocalcin may protect our hearts, says Dr Sophie Millar, a researcher in vascular medicine who co-authored the study in the Journal of Cellular Physiology last November. Meanwhile in January, researchers at Tongji University in Shanghai reported in the journal Aging that stroke patients given osteocalcin after they fell ill subsequently showed less brain damage. The researchers speculate that the hormone prevents inflammatory damage in the brain caused by the stroke. Studies have also shown that patients in intensive care with life-threatening conditions such as sepsis are significantly more likely to die if they also show rapid thinning of their bones. It appears our skeletons may play a strong hand in determining if we make it to old bones. How to boost your bones EXERCISE: Studies in mice show that moderate exercise triggers the release of osteocalcin, a protein hormone that has been found to boost muscle performance. Osteocalcin naturally declines with age, but Columbia University research in 2016 shows that raising levels of osteocalcin through moderate exercise, such as walking briskly, can restore our musclesâ€™ exercise capacity. OLIVE OIL AND VITAMIN K: The Mediterranean diet â€” rich in fresh fruit, vegetables, fish and olive oil â€” appears to strengthen bones. Spanish researchers reported in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism in 2012 that middle-aged men who ate a Mediterranean diet for two years saw significant rises in their levels of osteocalcin. Laboratory studies suggest oleuropein, a constituent of virgin olive oil, may have a protective effect â€” it also contains vitamin K, which has been found to support production of new bone cells. AVOID FIZZY DRINKS: Numerous studies suggest drinking pop may harm bones, particularly in women. Last year, for example, public health investigators at the University of California, San Diego, examined the health records of 72,000 women. They warned in the journal Menopause that those who drink two or more fizzy drinks a day increase their risk of hip fracture by more than a quarter. SLEEP PROPERLY: Insufficient sleep is linked with a higher risk of developing osteoporosis. A study last year of 11,000 post-menopausal women, in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, found that those who reported sleeping five hours or less per night had thinner bones in their whole body, compared with women who reported sleeping seven hours per night. The mechanisms behind this are unknown."

He said he had to wait for about 10 minutes for the fog to disappear before he could capture his image  The future of photography is in good hands. How can we be sure? Because the Sony World Photography Awards has just released the shortlisted images for its 2020 student and youth competitions â€“ and they are quite something to behold. Student entrants, from higher education institutions across the world, were challenged to submit images that showed people trying to break invisible barriers, whether natural, social or intellectual and also a body of work connected to sustainability. The youth competition entrants, meanwhile, were asked between June and December last year to submit up to three images relating to a specific theme each month. The themes included landscape, travel, portraiture and street photography. The stunning shortlisted pictures, taken by young photographers from the USA to the UK via South Africa, will go on display at Somerset House in London this April.

96,Mel B accuses nanny who 'broke apart her marriage' to Stephen Belafonte of being her former husband's 'girlfriend and mistress',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8095069/Mel-B-accuses-nanny-former-husbands-girlfriend-mistress.html,"Mel Bhas reportedly claimed the nanny who 'broke apart her marriage to Stephen Belafonte' is her ex-husband's 'girlfriend' and 'mistress'. The mother-of-three, 44, is said to have made the accusation in court papers filed after she discoveredLorraine Gilles, 29, was still caring for her eight-year-old daughter Madison. The Spice Girl is also alleged to have claimed her young daughter had been 'forced to perpetuate a lie formed by her father' to keep Gilles 'out of trouble'. Mel B said Madison had been asked by her father to refer to Gilles as 'Jenny' so her mother would not find out about his apparent relationship, reports have claimed. But the eight-year-old allegedly told her older sister Phoenix, 21, about the pair. Mel B reportedly claimed in the legal papers that her oldest child, from her first marriage toJimmy Gulzar, was shocked by the development because she knew her mother andBelafonte had a 'confidential agreement' banning the nanny from being near her family. In documents seen by The Sun, she said: 'I am shocked that our daughter would be forced to perpetuate a lie formed by her father simply to keep his mistress/girlfriend/nanny out of trouble. 'It is psychologically abusive for our little girl to be forced to keep secrets for her father or be made to believe that she cannot share what she wants... with her mother.' The accusation comes afterGilles was recently snapped picking up Madison from her school in Los Angeles as she walked the family dog. Gilles, who was 18 when she was hired by the couple as a nanny, admitted to having sex with both Belafonte and Mel in threesomes during a deposition in their divorce case in 2017. In April 2019, the Spice Girl paid out $1.8 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought against her by Gilles whom she had called a 'prostitute' and a 'homewrecker' two years earlier. Mel B and Belafonte currently share joint custody of Madison following their acrimonious divorce. However, in early February it was reported Belafonte, 44, had filed for full custody of their child. He claimed Mel B had 'all but abandoned' her after she returned to the UK. The Spice Girl is also reported to want full custody of Madison. In December, after discovering Gilles was still involved in the eight-year-old's life, the singer asked a court in Los Angeles to bar her from having any contact with the child. She cited a 'stay away' provision included in the confidential settlement she reached with Gilles but, according to the Sun, the judge denied the request. A source close to Mel said there are 'valid reasons' she wants the nanny to keep a distance and 'she is beside herself' that Belafonte and Gilles are flouting the 'stay away' agreement. Representatives for Mel B and Stephen Belafonte have been contacted for comment."

John Frederick Zurick was taken to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital with severe injuries after the incident on February 22. Paramedics were called to the cottage in Winsford, near Minehead, on the Prime Minister's family estate in Somerset, but were unable to save his wife Debbie, 56. The inquest, which opened yesterday at Plymouth Coroners' Court, heard that Southampton-born Zurick was estranged from his wife. The hearing confirmed that he had died from a shotgun wound to his head. The coroner Ian Arrow was told that Avon and Somerset police are carrying out a murder investigation into the death of Mrs Zurick. The inquest was adjourned and the case will be passed on to a coroner in Somerset who is dealing with Mrs Zurick's death. The couple, who had been married for 30 years, bred and trained clumber spaniels. The Zuricks were regulars at game shoots and were key figures in the Working Clumber Spaniel Society, of which Princess Anne is president. On the society's website, Mr Zurick describes how he trained Anne's dog Sparkle but received a rebuke from the princess when the hound failed to bring back a pheasant. They were also close neighbours of Stanley Johnson - father of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Stanley Johnson previously told the Daily Mail: 'Both I and my whole family are shocked, stunned and saddened by this tragic incident. 'We very much regret the passing of Mrs Zurick. She was a neighbour and she was much loved. 'She was honorary secretary of the Working Clumber Spaniel Society and was much loved for the work she did, in the society and in Exmoor and beyond.'  The Zuricks bought the property, where the Prime Minister spent some of his childhood, from Mr Johnson's father Stanley for Â£440,000 in 2013. Stanley Johnson owns the neighbouring 14th century farmhouse on the Nethercote estate with his wife Jennifer.  Detective Chief Inspector Neil Rice, of the major crime investigation team, said: 'This is a tragic incident and detectives, investigators and crime scene specialists are working closely with local uniformed officers to examine the scene and reassure the local community. 'Dedicated liaison officers are also supporting family members and friends through this difficult time. 'We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident, and our focus is now on supporting those affected by it, and completing our inquiries so we can provide a file of evidence to the coroner's office for Somerset. 'My team and I will continue to co-operate with the Independent Office for Police Conduct on their investigation. 'There has been a large police presence in the small hamlet of Winsford and I would like to thank the local community for their patience, co-operation and support while we conducted our investigations. 'I would like anyone with concerns, worries or any information to speak to their local neighbourhood officers either face-to-face, by calling 101, or contacting us through our website.' "
98,Hundreds of stray dogs are found piled on top of each other after being 'illegally' slaughtered in Russia,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8094875/Russian-officials-accused-ordering-deaths-hundreds-dogs-cats.html,"The corpses of hundreds of stray dogs have been found piled on top of each other in a container - some decapitated - in what activists say is an example of illegal slaughter. Animal rights campaigners allege cruelty by a company employed to round up strays in Yakutsk. The heads of larger dogs were severed, say reports. 'All the animals have been murdered,' said the activists in a complaint to the General Prosecutor of Russia. By law strays should be caught, sterilised and released - not slaughtered, they said. One container revealed by animal activists was filled with the corpses of 153 dogs and 48 cats. City officials say some animals were slaughtered amid fears of the spread of rabies, a claim that activists say is untrue. A second container had an unspecified number of destroyed dogs and cats. One account estimated that there were 260 dead animals in total. Amid a mounting scandal, the mayor of Yakutsk, Sardana Avksentyeva, one of Russia's most prominent female local politicians, denied giving orders to kill the animals. Aysen Nikolaev, head of the government in Yakutia, the country's largest region, ordered an immediate investigation as state prosecutors also set about probing the the scandal. Later the regional veterinary service said 72 animals that had come into contact with a rabid dog had been put down. Official Pavel Pavlov said some heads were severed before being tested for rabies. But the activists dispute that there were any cases of rabies, and it is unclear why there is a discrepancy in numbers. The rabies claim was used as an 'excuse' to slaughter the animals and 'free space' at a temporary shelter for other strays the dog-catching company were impounding, they alleged. 'I was told there was a container full of corpses - and no living animals at the temporary shelter facility,' said activist Zlata Sycheva. 'In the morning we were not allowed there allegedly because of quarantine due to rabies.' But there was no evidence of rabies among the slaughtered animals, and a second container was found, said the campaigners. 'The dogs could not have killed themselves,' said Sycheva. Company MUP Zhilkomservice - employed to care for stray dogs - has not responded to local journalists. The state prosecutors' office in Yakutsk confirmed it had begun legal checks into the grisly case. "

Anna Zhdan was left with abroken skull and died in hospital the morning after the chainsaw-carved statue of a bear and a child toppled onto her. The youngster was visiting Dubovy Gai parkwith her parents to celebrate International Women's Day on Sunday. Anna was playing in a children's park while her parents werein an outdoor cafe 300 yards away. She climbed onto the 441lb wooden bear - which was not firmly fixed to the ground - and it fell on top of her. A video filmed by a witness shows Anna lying motionless on the ground minutes after the crash while her father calls her name. A crew of paramedics can be seen putting the unconscious girl, bleeding from her head, on a stretcher as the distraught father is begging them to save her life. Anna was rushed to the intensive care unit of Zaporizhia Regional Children's Hospital in critical condition. She had an open head injury, internal bleeding and multiple bone fractures to her legs, arms and ribs. A spokesperson for the hospital said to local media: 'The girl's condition was extremely grave. She died without regaining consciousness the following morning after the incident.' Police launched a criminal case for negligence of duty which caused the death of a minor. There have been no arrests so far. The facility administration was aware of the sculpture danger a long time ago but did nothing to remove it from the park, local media reports. Oleg Komarenko, the director of the park said: 'There were warning signs banning children from climbing the sculpture.' Residents said the wooden bear was installed in 2013 and has fallen several times since then. Nadiya, who often visits the popular amusement park, said: 'The bear fell not for the first time. 'Children toppled it over several times during the last few years and it was a miracle that nobody was killed back then. 'After each collapse, the park workers just put the sculpture back in its place without even fixing to the ground.' The park workers have removed all wooden sculptures from the scene after the tragedy, reports said."
1,Man in his 70s becomes fourth to die in the UK from coronavirus having contracted the bug in this country,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-coronavirus-fourth-person-dies-21661442,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs there are now ""four confirmed deaths"" connected to the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in the UK A patient in their 70s has become the fourth person to die from coronavirus in the UK. The pensioner, who had underlying health conditions, appeared to have contracted the disease in the UK and was being treated at the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs there are now ""four confirmedÂ  deaths"" connected to the coronavirus outbreak in the UK. Mr Hancock, responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, told MPs: ""Here in the UK, as of this morning, there were 319 confirmed cases. ""Very sadly this now includes four confirmed deaths. ""I entirely understand why people are worried and concerned and we send our condolences to the families."" Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England said: ""I am very sorry to report that a fourth patient in England who tested positive for COVID-19 has sadly died. ""I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their privacy is respected. ""The patient, who was being treated at the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital, was in their seventies and had underlying health conditions. It appears the virus was acquired in the UK and full contact tracing has begun.â€ Mr Hancock said the NHS is well prepared to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. He said: ""We continue to work to contain the virus, but we're also taking action to delay its impact, to fund research and to mitigate its consequences. ""Throughout our approach is guided by the science. That is the bedrock on which we base all our decisions. ""Our plan sets out what we are prepared to do and we'll make the right choices of which action to pursue at the right moment. ""The scientific advice is clear - acting too early creates its own risks, so we will do what is right to keep people safe. ""Guided by the science we'll act at the right time and we'll be clear and open about our actions and the reasons for them."" He added that the NHS has received a spike in calls through the 111 number. The Health Secretary said: ""We've now added an extra 700 people to support that effort. 111 online is now dealing with more inquiries than the voice calls."" He said 'the time taken to test is being reduced as we're bringing in a new system for faster results'. Mr Hancock told MPs: ""We will shortly bring forward legislative options to help people and services to tackle this outbreak. ""The Bill will be temporary and proportionate with measures that last only as long as necessary in line with clinical advice."" Mr Hancock added that the Government would stop at nothing to get its response right. The Health Secretary reassured the House of Commons that food supplies would continue even in a 'reasonable worst-case scenario'. Conservative former health secretary Jeremy Hunt asked Mr Hancock to reflect on what the UK has learnt from the coronavirus outbreak in China ""given that yesterday was the first day when reported new cases in the UK exceeded reported new cases in China"""
2,The place with the highest child poverty in the UK - where more than 58% of kids fall through the cracks - is just minutes from the world's richest bankers ,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-britains-child-poverty-capital-21635835,"EXCLUSIVE: Poplar and Limehouse in east London is just a few minutes walk away from Canary Wharf - one the biggest financial districts in the world - yet more than half of the children there are living in poverty It's just minutes away from one the biggest financial districts in the world yet it has the highest level of child poverty in the country. Poplar and Limehouse in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets is a modern day ""tale of two cities"". Punitive welfare policies, low wages and soaring housing costs have pushed more and more families below the breadline. Since the Tories came to power in 2010 child poverty in the UK has soared by more half a million from 3.6 million to 4.1 million. According to figures complied by charity End Child Poverty, the constituency tops the shameful league table with a concerning 58.5% of youngsters living in poverty once housing costs are included. Are you a parent struggling with poverty? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk Yet because of its location next to Canary Wharf, home to high-earning bankers and other workers in the financial industry, the true deprivation and social economic woes can be skewed by figures such as the average wage in the borough. Our Give Me Five campaign wants an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lift 200,000 children out of destitution. We also want the Government to restore child tax credits, to scrap the two-child limit and to axe the benefit cap. Mirror Online reporter Lorraine King visited Poplar and Limehouse to find out why it is Britain's child poverty capital. Poplar and Limehouse is also in the midst of gentrification which has resulted in a huge gulf between the rich and poor. There are multi-million pound homes saddled next to social housing. Surging house prices and rents in the capital means it is becoming more popular with high-earning bankers and financial workers who want a quick commute to Canary wharf. This means that poor families have less of a choice when it comes to which houses they can afford to rent. James King is a councillor for Poplar and Limehouse and says housing is one of the biggest issues surrounding child poverty. He told Mirror Online: ""There is a crisis going on with child poverty. I've been involved with politics for 10 years now and I have seen how the area has changed through gentrification but the child poverty remains the same. ""Child poverty has been an issue in Tower Hamlets as a borough for a very long time. ""We have some of the richest people in London living next door to some of the poorest. ""Housing in the private sector here is becoming more and more unaffordable but people still need to live around here because it's their community - their jobs are here, their families are here. ""But because housing is so unaffordable people are living in overcrowded conditions and that leads together issues such as damp that causes health issues."" Juli is a married mum-of-five who has lived in east London for most of her life until her private landlord doubled her rent and she found herself homeless. * Read more about our Give Me Five campaign She sought help from the council who moved her out of the borough to an address 20 miles away in Enfield. The 50-year-old couldn't afford the train fares to take her two youngest children to school she was forced to rely solely on buses. She said: ""This meant getting up at 4am to make sure we got to school before 9am. But sometimes the journey was too long for my youngest daughter and she would end up wetting herself as we never passed any toilets on the way. ""It was horrible but we had no choice I couldn't afford to get a train so I started bringing a change of clothes for when she did have a accident."" According to the council, there are more than 20,000 households on their housing list but they grant just 1,800 tenancies a year. Dad-of-two Abdul Hamid is on the housing list but in the meantime he is being forced to rent a one-bedroom flat privately for Â£1,400 a month. He said: ""Because I'm renting privately and not homeless my family is not a priority. I have been bidding for lots of homes but nothing so far. ""Rent privately is what has pushed my family into poverty."" Since 2010, Tower Hamlets Council has been forced to make Â£190m cuts to cope with a financial blackhole caused by a decrease in government funding. Figures by the National Education Union also shows that schools in the borough have lost a whooping Â£110million of funding since 2015 - the equivalent of Â£725 per pupil. Paul Garayo, is the chief executive of Limehouse-based arts and community charity Stitches in Time, which teaches women in the area valuable dressmaking skills to help them crawl out of poverty. He said: ""Government cuts are forcing people to turn to charities like Stitches in Time. ""There's a lot of provision that the local government miss out and people fall through the cracks. We provide a safe space so people can florish. We allow people to realise their aspirations and build up skills that can help them find employment."" Local councillor James King said: ""The council has felt increasing challenges when it comes to funding because most of their funding comes from the Government. ""We have to make a couple million of cuts every single year. We try and protect the services that help the most vulnerable like children's social care. ""We want the government to give more power to the local authorities this will allow us to let people have more say about their own lives. It's unfair that the government has a say on whether councils can run properly or not. ""It should be fairer than that."" The Government's controversial benefits system has been blamed on plunging more families into poverty. Research by the council into Universal Credit found that so many residents were struggling to make ends meet that they set up a Â£6.6miliion poverty fund to help plug the gap. Out of the funds, Â£1m was ring-fenced for the most vulnerable families facing waits of up to five week for any money as they switched to Universal Credit. Tower Hamlets Mayor John Biggs said: ""Universal Credit has made serious problems for families. â€œWe were one of the first boroughs to be fully transitioned onto Universal Credit so we are well aware that its introduction has presented serious challenges for our residents."" Deputy Mayor Rachael Blake is also the borough's cabinet member tasked with tackling poverty. She told Mirror Online that Universal Credit has been identified as one of the biggest causes of poverty in the borough. ""It is driving people into further poverty and debt and the housing costs. ""This is why we set up the poverty fund so we can help the most vulnerable people and support them as much as we can. Some people are unaware that they are entitled to other benefits so we have an outreach team to make sure they care claiming everything they are entitled to."" Tower Hamlets has the largest Bangladeshi population in the county. The 2011 Census showed the Bengali community made up 32 per cent of people living in the borough. This is compared to the community making up three per cent of the population in London and just one per cent in England. In 2015 a report called 'Ethnic Inequalities' by the Centre for Social Investigation (CSI)Â  claimed that British Bangladeshis are around three times more likely to be in poverty compared to their white counterparts. It also claimed people from the Bengali community were more likely to be lower-skilled in living in overcrowded conditions which fuels poverty. Teenager Thamima lives in Limehouse with her Bengali parents and three siblings. The family-of-six have lived in a two-bedroom council flat since Thamima, 17, was six months-old. She said: ""This has always been an area with a lot of Bengali people who are poor area even though it's becoming gentrified. ""We've been on the waiting list for a bigger house for seven years and it hasn't worked out. It's a similar situation for lots of families here who have been on the list for years and years because there is such a shortage of housing. ""A lot of Bengali parents aren't confident with the English language so may miss out on claiming benefits they are entitled to. ""I know some children have to sit down and fill out forms for their parents or even claim Universal Credit for them""."

Taking to Twitter , one viewer said: ""Underwhelmed sadly most of the routine was skated by the pros Perri just rolled around the floor and did a very impressive backflip on ice"" ""Perri was hardly in the routine, they had more professionals in his routine than they would in an actual group routine and is it just me or did he not land the backflip properly? A third said: ""Needed more of Perri and Vanessa less of the pros in that dance! Heâ€™s amazing on his own/in his couple - they didnâ€™t really need anything else - brilliant back flip!""

6,Couple split up at airport but board flight anyway - with life-changing results,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/couple-split-up-airport-board-21614459,"Vet Janey Lowes had a glam WAG life with her professional rugby player boyfriend in Newcastle until she went to save street dogs in Sri Lanka and win at Animal Heroes My life five years ago is unrecognisable from the one I lead now. Back then, I was a vet working with small animals in my native Newcastle, and living with my professional rugby player boyfriend, Alex. At 25, I had the career of my dreams, a nice house, a nice car, and no money worries. Life was good. I have wanted to be a vet ever since I was a little girl, one of five kids growing up in Barnard Castle, County Durham. My dadâ€™s family were farmers and I was surrounded by animals, although my first true love was Finn, a brown and white spaniel, who was an abandoned puppy I adopted when I was doing work experience at a vet aged 16. Finn slept in my bed and I adored him. It was Finn who ignited my strong connection with dogs. After qualifying from Nottingham University, I relocated back up north for work and moved in with Alex. Weâ€™d been together since I was 14, he was my soul mate and best friend rolled into one. But things started to go downhill when we lived together. On the outside, we had everything, a seemingly enviable and glamorous lifestyle. But Iâ€™d come home tired and stressed, and heâ€™d be exhausted from playing rugby full time. It was like the fun was over and we needed to shake things up. We booked a trip to Sri Lanka in May 2014. The holiday was supposed to repair our relationship, but we ended up splitting up at the airport before we even got there! We still went as friends, though, and the country blew me away. The beaches, sunshine, friendly locals and surfing were heavenly. The only problem for me â€“ and it was a huge problem â€“ was the street dogs. They were everywhere! The healthy ones seemed happy enough roaming the streets, but all too often they were mange-ridden or injured. Their soulful eyes followed me as if asking for help. One dog that particularly got to me I called Tom. He was so friendly and trusting. He had a nasty gash under his eye, which would have been simply treated in the UK with a few stitches. I knew that in a tropical climate it would soon be infested with maggots. I didnâ€™t have any of my veterinary kit with me, but I couldnâ€™t leave him like that, so I decided Iâ€™d pay for a Sri Lankan vet to treat him. I asked several, but despite me offering to pay, none would agree to treat a street dog, because they werenâ€™t viewed as worthy, which shocked me and I didnâ€™t know what to do. Back home, I couldnâ€™t get poor Tom out of my mind. I started Googling Sri Lankan charities that helped street dogs â€“ my worry was those that I could find had been set up by well-meaning individuals as opposed to vets. I wasnâ€™t sure their ethics and way of working would align with mine. I was desperate to make a real difference. With Alex and I now split, it would have been easy to move out and carry on with my nice comfortable life, but I realised there was nothing tying me down now. Why not go to Sri Lanka and start treating these animals? I had some savings, I thought I could survive for a year, help some dogs, and then come home. So I spoke to my wonderful manager at the surgery, Nick, about my plan. He was so supportive and even gave Â£10,000 from the company to help me get started. What a boss! Online, I found a woman called Otara Gunewardene, whoâ€™d set up an organisation called Embark, based in the capital Colombo, which helped street dogs. She explained the most useful thing a vet could do was neutering and vaccination, which made total sense to me and I decided to make those the focus of my charity, which I called WECare Worldwide. I tied up the loose ends of my life, sold my car and booked my flight for October 2014. Along with my clothes, I packed surgical kits, bandaging and Manuka honey, which can help with wound management. My family came to wave me off at the airport, and I was excited rather than daunted. Landing in Colombo, in the heat and with the tuk tuks and bustle was a thrill, but I headed straight for Talalla, a beautiful beach town in the south where Iâ€™d met Tom, the dog with the poorly eye whose photo I had kept with me to remember my mission. I stayed at a surfing retreat initially, where Iâ€™d previously made friends from my holiday with Alex. One of the first dogs I treated was Joy, who had been bitten by another dog and whose wound was crawling with maggots. I tweezed them all out, cleaned her up, and bandaged her. No one had ever seen a bandaged dog before! It was a drop in the ocean, but I felt so happy to have achieved something when she went back onto the street, now wagging her tail. Making the charity a success became my focus. As well as treating the dogs, I taught myself how to build a website, how to fundraise, generate publicity, and all the other things you never think about. I also learned how to speak Sinhalese, and soon understood when locals called me a crazy white dog lady! I worked and worked. I went from having one tuk tuk driver to now employing 17 members of staff, including five vets, three nurses and several trainees. In the blink of an eye Iâ€™d been in the country a year, then two â€“ and now over five years have passed. Sri Lanka is my home. Since my first patient, maggoty Joy, we have helped around 12,000 street dogs â€“ from puppies bitten by poisonous snakes, to dogs who have eaten food laced with explosives. Iâ€™ve had to amputate muttsâ€™ legs whoâ€™ve been run over, and treat STDs, yes, dogs get them too. I am frequently bitten by dogs, including some with rabies, so Iâ€™ve needed jabs that have sometimes made me sick. Iâ€™ve contracted mange, as well as ringworm, which isnâ€™t nice. Iâ€™ve suffered abuse from locals who think I am mad. But itâ€™s all been worth it. Twice a year I come back to the UK for fundraising, and Iâ€™ll go to the dentist, hairdresser and get my legs waxed at the same time. My priorities have changed. I havenâ€™t used a hair dryer or worn make-up during the day for years. I eat fish, rice, and veggies, but I miss proper chocolate, Wotsits, and cheese, which you canâ€™t get here. Surfing is my therapy, I try to go every day. In 2018 I was thrilled to win Vet of the Year. I came back to Britain for Amanda Holden to present me with a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Award. Alesha Dixon and Laura Whitmore were lovely. Then last year, I featured on C5â€™s Ben Fogleâ€™s Lives In The Wild. His dad is a vet and Ben was so supportive and kind. My life now is a far cry from the one I had in Newcastle. I live in a simple beach bungalow, with a lean-to kitchen, camping hob and sadly, rats. One room has air conditioning, but itâ€™s expensive to use and I try and live frugally. I have adopted five dogs â€“ I couldnâ€™t resist! â€“ called Mali, Benji, Stitch, Lottie, and Tilly. But Iâ€™ve had to toughen up, or I would have taken them all in. I am ready to meet someone now, but Iâ€™m not desperate to have kids, Iâ€™ve got the dogs. There are enough people on the planet, but I would consider adoption. Iâ€™d like to expand our charity across Sri Lanka and open clinics in other parts of Asia. People have described me as selfless, but I love what I do and get to spend time with animals every day. I get as much back from these dogs as I give them, I feel so lucky. â€“ Janey The Vet by Janey Lowes is out on 19 March (Â£14.99, Michael Oâ€™Mara) available to pre-order now.

7,"Coronavirus 'worrying' world's oldest man, 111, from UK but 'Spanish flu was worse'",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-worries-worlds-oldest-man-21660142,"Bob Weighton, from Alton, Hants, says he's lived 'long enough' but is worried about his relatives contracting Covid-19 and has taken to washing his hands more frequently after the outbreak  The world's oldest man today admitted he's 'worried' about the coronavirus - but insists it's not as bad as the 1918 Spanish flu.  Bob Weighton, 111, from Alton, Hants, says he's lived 'long enough' but is worried about his relatives contracting Covid-19. Mr Weighton has been taking greater care with cleanliness and hygiene since the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. He's taken to washing his hands more frequently and using a nailbrush to scrub under his nails. But Mr Weighton, who remembers the Spanish flu outbreak after World War I, maintained that Covid-19 is less fearsome. Mr Weighton, who still lives on his own in a flat in Alton, was born on March 29 in 1908 and has lived through the Spanish flu, both World Wars, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union and the invention of the internet. But despite having seen off so many dangers, he admitted the rapid spread of coronavirus concerns him. He said: ""I'm very worried about coronavirus - everyone should be. ""I should be worried about myself but I've lived long enough. But I'm more worried for my children and grandchildren. ""I'm washing my hands more and using a nailbrush to clean my nails properly. I'm being much more cautious."" More than 100 years ago, Mr Weighton saw the spread of the Spanish flu, a pandemic which started in 1918 after soldiers fighting in World War One returned home and brought the disease with them. Between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide are thought to have died. Speaking of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,500 people globally, Mr Weighton said: ""The numbers of people dying in China is scary. ""But in Europe and elsewhere, the numbers are still not reaching the millions that died of the Spanish flu. ""I hope they never do. But you never know how bad the coronavirus will get. You just have to do the best you can and not worry."" He added: ""I was only ten at the time of the Spanish flu. ""I remember hearing stories going round and reading newspaper articles - as I am doing now with the coverage of coronavirus - about people getting the Spanish flu and dying. But luckily I never got it."" Mr Weighton said he has been lucky to avoid truly serious illnesses during his time. ""I've never been at a point of dying off,"" he added. ""But I did have a growth on my stomach which could have been serious. I had to have an operation which has left me with only half of my stomach left. That was about 30 years ago."" Mr Weighton was born in Hull, East Yorkshire, and was the middle child of his three brothers and three sisters. He had three children of his own, has 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. He remembers the outbreak of the first world war and as a teenager he trained in marine engineering. But by the time he qualified in 1925 the shipping industry was in decline and so he headed to Taiwan, where he worked as an English teacher and also met his future wife Agnes. On the eve of World War II in 1939, Bob and his family attempted to return to the UK by boat, but after arriving in Canada they were informed the war had begun and they were stuck there. After the attack on Pearl Harbour while Mr Weighton was living in Denver, USA, his knowledge of the Japanese language meant he was recruited by the British Political Warfare Mission. He deciphered enemy messages and also worked to disrupt the morale of the Japanese to try and help the Americans win their fight. After the war, he was finally able to return to England with his wife and three children and spent the rest of his working life as a lecturer in marine engineering at City University in London, until his retirement, aged 65, in 1973. He and his wife, who passed away in 1997, spent much of their retirement volunteering as marriage councillors and helping at youth groups in Alton. Mr Weighton has lived through the reign of five monarchs and seen 26 Prime Ministers come and go from 10 Downing Street. Remarkably, he had shared the title of Britain's oldest man with Alf Smith, of Perthshire, as the pair were born on the same day, but Mr Smith died last year. He became the world's oldest man two weeks ago following the death of Chitetsu Watanabe, from Japan, at the age of 112."
8,Best new TV shows in spring 2020 from Little Mix The Search to The Undoing and Quiz,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/best-new-tv-shows-spring-21658151,"Spring 2020 looks set to an exciting season for TV viewers, with dramatic new shows such as Honour, Quiz, Four Lives and The Undoing You know what they say... when life gives you a global killer virus and crazy weather, best to stay indoors and watch telly. Fortunately thereâ€™s plenty to get excited about, with TV drama at an all-time high as broadcasters battle to be the best on the box.  Hit shows are set to return this spring, including series six of BBC1â€™s Line of Duty , a fourth run of C4â€™s The Handmaidâ€™s Tale, a second outing for Ricky Gervaisâ€™s Netflix comedy After Life and a third season for BBCâ€™s mega hit Killing Eve .  But hereâ€™s our round-up of the brand new shows coming soon to the small screen that you definitely wonâ€™t want to missâ€¦ Keeley Hawes stars in this two-parter as the real life detective who hunted down the killers of 20-year-old Banaz Mahmod.  The young Londoner was strangled to death and buried in a suitcase in a so-called honour killing in 2006. Banaz had fled an abusive arranged marriage and fallen in love with a new man, which her family said brought shame on the family. Honour tells how Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goodeâ€™s passionate search brought the murderers to justice. Keeley says: â€œIn a time where honour killings are still rife, it is critical to shine a light on such an important subject.â€  In a departure from comedy, Stephen Merchant plays a creepy serial killer in this thriller about the real life Barking Murders.  He plays murderer and rapist Stephen Port, who killed four men, hunting out his prey on dating app Grindr between 2014 and 2015. Sheridan Smith plays Sarah Sak, the mum of murdered 23-year-old Anthony Walgate.  The series aims to tell the story of the murders from the point of view of the victimsâ€™ families and their fight to uncover the truth amid a highly-criticised police investigation. â€œItâ€™s a story that canâ€™t be ignored,â€ says Stephen.  With a blonde wig and fake tan, Michael Sheen has transformed himself to play quiz host Chris Tarrant in this drama about the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? cheating scandal.  In 2001, Major Charles Ingram, his wife Diana and accomplice Tecwen Whittock, who was sitting in the audience, duped the show by setting up a coughing code in order to win the top prize. The audacious heist, which saw the three stand trial, is told in three parts and also stars Sian Clifford, Mark Bonnar, Helen McCrory and Aisling Bea.  Line of Dutyâ€™s Martin Compston and Peaky Blindersâ€™ Sophie Rundle join forces for this thriller, meaning itâ€™s bound to be an absolute belter.  They play well-off couple Dan and Emily, living in Glasgow, who are desperate to have a baby but have had no success despite trying for years. When they meet down-on-her-luck teenager Kaya (Mirren Mack), they make a surrogacy pact with her that will change all their lives forever. It feels like the three were meant to meet, but was it really by chance? And will everyone get their happy ending? It doesnâ€™t sound likelyâ€¦ Mel and Sue playing contract assassins is the killer comedy duo we never knew we needed. Sue Perkins plays Fran, while Mel Giedroyc plays Jamie - two best mates who just happen to kill people for a living. Having stumbled into the career, the hapless pair are not your typical murderers. Working out of their scruffy van, each hit is derailed by bickering and general incompetence. And as the body count stacks up, their friendship is put through the wringer. Expect brilliant disguises, plenty of banter and a lot of death. Laugh out loud funny, this comedy about parenting and its many pitfalls stars Martin Freeman and Daisy Haggard. They play couple Paul and Ally, who meet, fall in love and everything is going swimmingly - until they have kids. â€œWho is happy with two kids under seven?â€ asks Ally. As they juggle careers, a mortgage, kids and troublesome parents, the sitcom also looks at that parenting paradoxâ€¦ Paul explains: â€œI would die for those kids, but often, I also want to kill them.â€ This semi-autobiographical comedy from young Canadian star Mae Martin follows her as a recovering addict and comedian. Life is further complicated by a new and all-consuming relationship with her new girlfriend George, played by Call The Midwife actress Charlotte Ritchie. Then add into the mix Maeâ€™s mother, played by Friends legend Lisa Kudrow. And watch out for Sophie Thompson as another recovering addict. â€œItâ€™s sweet and very funny and awkward and well observed,â€ says Kudrow.  A stellar Hollywood cast, including Nicole Kidman , Hugh Grant , Edgar Ramirez and Donald Sutherland , take on this gripping miniseries from the creators of Big Little Lies and the producer of The Night Manager.  Kidman plays Grace Fraser, a successful therapist on the brink of publishing her first book, who has a devoted husband (Grant) and a son at an elite New York school. But a violent death, a missing husband and a whole heap of shocking and terrible revelations all leads to a very public disaster. A psychological thriller thatâ€™s set to get everyone talking.  From comedy film titans Greg Daniels and Steve Carrell , the guys who brought The Office to America, comes this hilarious new workplace sitcom.   Carrell stars alongside John Malkovich as part of a new Space Force.  The premise is that the government has announced this new, sixth branch of the United States armed services. Itâ€™s mission? â€œTo defend satellites from attack and to perform other space-related tasks. Or something.â€ What could possibly go wrong? A 19th century tale of adventure and mystery, this is an epic story of love, murder and revenge based on Eleanor Cattonâ€™s award-winning novel. Set on the Wild West Coast of New Zealandâ€™s South Island in the boom years of the 1860s gold rush, it tells the story of men and women who travelled across the world to make their fortunes.  Bond girl Eva Green stars as a calculating brothel madam, along with Eve Hewson and Himesh Patel as star-crossed lovers.  Tom Hollander and Saskia Reeves star in this heartbreaking and humorous story of a relationship on the brink, adapted from David Nichollsâ€™ hit novel.  Douglas Petersen (Hollander) is blindsided when his wife Connie (Reeves) says sheâ€™s not sure she wants to be married to him anymore. Agreeing to still go on their planned family grand tour of Europe, Douglas vows to win back her love and repair his relationship with their son Albie (Tom Taylor). Itâ€™s a journey through some beautiful cities and some troubled souls. When emergency services received a call from concerned people in Salisbury in March, 2018, worried about an old man and a young woman ill on a bench, it kickstarted an extraordinary chain of events. The Russian double agent and his daughter had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, targeted by Russian nationals. Anne-Marie Duff , Rafe Spall and Mark Addy lead the cast in the drama which focuses on the impact on the local community, as Salisbury became the unlikely focus of a national emergency.  Julie Graham and Neil Morrissey lead the cast in this three-parter that explores forbidden love, betrayal and grief. They play married couple Rosalie and Luke, who along with teenage daughter Maddie, go to bereavement counselling when their son dies. Once there, their lives are changed yet again when they mean Jed, a beautiful, charismatic young man who eventually moves in on their lives. A lover to Maddie, a surrogate son to Rosalie, it all seems hopeful, but a morally corrupt nightmare is taking shape and itâ€™s not going to end well.  With The X Factor firmly at deathâ€™s door, itâ€™s down to global superstars Little Mix to step into the shoes of Simon Cowell.  They are on the search for talented singers to become members of all-female, all-male or mixed bands in this brand new entertainment show. The hit makers, aka Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, will create the bands and become mentors as the new bands live together and battle for the prize to join Little Mix on tour.

9,Biggest Crufts fails - from badly timed toilet breaks to easily distracted dogs,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/biggest-crufts-fails-badly-timed-21589318,"The world's biggest dog show returns to Birmingham's NEC on March 5 so we look back at some of our favourite funny moments Crufts, the world's biggest dog show, is back and thousands of pooches are competing to be crowned the winner. But the stars of the show turn out to be the most unlikely candidates. Over the years these lovable dogs have won hearts because of their hilarious efforts in the ring. From hiding in the tunnels and refusing to jump over hurdles, to simply refusing to do the course, these dogs are the clowns of Crufts who make it so memorable. Here we look at some of the funniest fails... Gentle giant Kratu stole everyone's hearts in the Rescue Dog Agility round in 2018. The Romanian rescue dog started off well enough, flinging himself at a hurdle, but he was easily distracted.  Kratu flew through the tunnel, but decided to take a well-earned rest inside before he bounded off again in all directions.  His spectacular performance went viral and he returned by popular demand last year.  The Jack Russell was so excited to get going on the course, he slid into the first hurdle and fell over in 2017. But like any great champion, Olly dusted himself off and got straight back up again.  Making a strong come back, he zoomed around the course, jumping off the hurdles and flying through the tunnel. About half way through though, he got a little lost and had a sniff of the corner of the ring.  Lucas the Saluki was only interested in one thing in 2014 - sprinting to his heart's content.  Having the time of his life, he ignored most of the hurdles and had no time for the tunnel. Instead he bounded around happily, just like a dog should.  The little Papillon gets top marks for loyalty to her owner as she didn't want to leave her side in 2018. After multiple attempts to get Tinklebury to have a go at the course, all she wanted to do was play with her owner. Her owner even tried to pick her up and position her right in front of a hurdle but Tinklebury was having none of it.  With a helping hand though, they eventually managed to get her over one hurdle.  This cross-breed's hopes of glory went down the pan when she just couldn't hold it in on the agility course in 2012.  Libby was doing well at first but with only the slalom poles to tackle, she was disqualified. Despite making the wrong kind of impression on the judges, a commentator quipped: ""A dog's got to do what a dog's got to do. What a shame."" ""Oh dear, disqualified. What was the reason for the disqualification? Pooing on the course, now that's not very nice is it?"""
10,Inside the Mexican hotel where the couples stayed for hit Netflix series Love is Blind ,https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/central-south-america/love-blind-filmed-inside-mexican-21660779,"Love is Blind couples were treated to the ultimate romantic getaway at Mexican hotel Grand Velas Riviera Maya and it's so luxurious Netflix 's Love is Blind has had us glued to our screens from the moments where the couples met in the pods, got engaged... and all of the drama that ensued before their big days.  Then of course there are have been all of the romantic settings from their cosy pods to the lavish resort where they got to know each other before meeting the families and planning their weddings. The pods themselves were custom-built at Pinewood Atlanta Studios so you won't be able to visit them, but the good news is that you can recreate the couples' luxury holidays in Mexico.  That's because the trip didn't take place on a set - instead, they jet-setted off to the luxurious Mexican resort Grand Velas Riviera Maya , near the bustling Playa del Carmen.  When we say luxurious, we mean it. For a start, a stay in one of the resort's Grand Class suites are 1,377 sq. foot and offer up incredible oceanfront views. Then there's the king-size bed with plush linens, a huge marble bath with a Jacuzzi tub, a rain shower and even space for a massage table should you want some in-room pampering. Other highlights include a private terrace with a plunge pool - which proved popular with the couples during their stay, as it led to many romantic moments. They won't have needed to lift a finger, with suites boasting a pillow menu, daily turndown service, a walk-in closet to store their clothes, a lounge area with a sofa for relaxing, and heaps more perks. Of course the couples did manage to tear themselves away from their suites to enjoy some quality time by the pool - and they had three pools to choose from. (One of the pools was the unfortunate setting for the showdown between Diamond and Carlton). If the pool doesn't appeal, then the resort also offers a beach, where we saw Amber and Barnett enjoy a picnic date. For couples after some quality time together, there's plenty of opportunity to make memories; guests have access to a jam-packed activities programme including snorkeling, kayaking, boogie boards, yoga and pilates, not to mention the countless excursions that can be organised. Guests who take a leaf out of Gigi and Damian's book and opt for spa treatments will have a plethora of choice thanks to the extensive treatment menu on offer - and while they opted for outdoor massages, the resort's spa does have an indoor section complete with its hydrotherapy pools. When it came to dinner dates, the couples had a choice of the resort's five signature restaurants spanning everything from gourmet Mexican dishes to classic French cuisine and even Mediterranean inspired offerings. Or, like the couples, suite guests can opt for in-room dining if they're looking to make the most of their private terraces.  Feeling inspired to have your own romantic break? The hotel has launched a Love is Blind themed package which includes heaps of the perks and luxury experiences which the couples got to enjoy during their stay. "
11,Daniel Craig reveals James Bond five-year delay was partly down to his anxiety and feeling low,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/daniel-craig-says-five-year-21659543,"The actor, 52, is returning as James Bond for a fifth time in No Time To Die, but he's admitted that the five-year wait for the movie was partly caused by his anxiety over the role Daniel Craig says that the five-year wait for new James Bond film No Time To Die was partly caused by him suffering from anxiety and feeling ""physically really low"".  The actor, who is returning for his fifth outing as 007, has admitted struggling with the physicality required for preparing for the role. He had said his last Bond flick Spectre would be his final time playing the secret agent, before later changing his mind. The 52-year-old also said the demanding role has left him suffering from anxiety.  He told GQ magazine: ""I was never going to do one again.  ""I was like, 'Is this work really genuinely worth this, to go through this, this whole thing?' And I didn't feel... I felt physically really low. ""So the prospect of doing another movie was just, like, off the cards. ""And that's why it has been five years."" His last turn as Bond was in 2015's Spectre, which at the time was reported to be his final outing as the spy. Daniel said that the ""physicality"" of Bond is ""a preparation, in a way"", because he would not get the script beforehand. ""It's making my head go, 'This is what it's going to be',"" he added. Trying to prepare for a role in one of the most popular film franchises in modern cinema without a script also caused him to have anxiety. He said: ""I have suffered from it in the past. ""I have suffered because it's been like, 'I can't cope. I can't deal with this'."" The British actor has also told of his regret over not speaking up about the script for the previous four Bond films in which he has starred. ""I've kept my mouth shut before and I've stayed out of it and I've respected it and I've regretted that I did,"" he told the magazine. Looking ahead to life after Bond, Daniel, who is married to actress Rachel Weisz, said that his future may involve ""having another kid, maybe just being older"".  He said: ""But all of these things, I was just like, you know, f**k  it. There are other things that are more important.""  On future acting roles, he added: ""I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. ""Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f**king good fist of it.""  The star said that No Time To Die, which was recently pushed back to be released in November instead of April amid global concern around the spread of coronavirus, will have references to Donald Trump .  ""We struggled to keep Trump out of this film, but of course it is there,"" Daniel said.  ""It's always there, whether it's Trump, or whether it's Brexit , or whether it's Russian influence on elections or whatever...  ""There are British people working in the top industries in the world and at the top of those industries. ""We do that, and we are good at that. And somehow we're kind of breaking all that apart. Whether that's breaking from Europe... There is a sort of a nihilism, isn't there?"" The film finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter from the CIA - played by Jeffrey Wright - turns up asking for help. A mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading to a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology. No Time To Die also stars Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas and is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, with a script co-written by Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It will be released in UK cinemas on November 12. * Daniel Craig stars in the April issue of British GQ in a global GQ James Bond exclusive. GQ's April issue is available from Wednesday, March 11."
12,MH370 passengers in 'terrifying 12 min death dive' after pilot 'incinerated in cockpit',https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mh370-passengers-terrifying-12-min-21640306,"Six years ago today, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared without a trace - the wreckage of the plane has never been found and there has been no resolution for the families of all 239 on board On March 8, 2014, the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. It should have landed in Beijing, China, later that day but instead disappeared less than an hour after take-off. The wreckage of the Boeing 777 has never been found, nor have any trace of the passengers and cabin crew on board. Debris began to wash up on beaches across the Indian Ocean more than three years after the plane vanished. Heartbreakingly, the search for the missing jet was called off in 2018 - but there are still no answers as to what actually happened to Flight MH370. Conspiracy theories surrounding the plane circulated almost as soon as it went missing. Did the pilot deliberately change the course in a gruesome murder suicide or was the plane hijacked? Were its controls remotely hacked and was it landed safely outside of the radar that should have been tracking it. MH370 set off in a normal take-off from Kuala Lumpur but 38 minutes into the flight it made its final communication with air traffic control. It disappeared from conventional radar minutes later but was tracked by military systems for another hour, where it seemed to be deviating from its planned flight path. Journalist Ean Higgins author of The Hunt For MH370 believes he knows exactly what happened to the jet. Amateur detective Mick Gilbert came up with the theory, although there is no concrete evidence that this is what happened. He claims there was a devastating blaze in the plane's cockpit around 40 minutes into the flight when the windshield heater on the pilot's side caught fire. Ean says this could have burned out some circuits, including the secondary radar transponder and the communication systems. Pilots are trained for emergencies just like this and would have simply put on their oxygen masks and cut the power to the heater. But Ean claims this led to a catastrophic chain of events that caused the deaths of everyone on board. By cutting power, the crew would also have switched off the satellite data unit, which meant they were no longer linked to satellites. Ean then believes the First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, will have been the one in charge of the plane while Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah dealt with the blaze. As soon as the fire was under control the captain and first officer would have made a distress call. Emergency training for pilots stresses that making sure the plane remains airborne and finding a course for the nearest airport are the two initial priorities in an in-flight emergency. The third is to radio for help and to let air traffic control know what is happening, which means the plane could have changed route without anyone on the ground being aware. However, Ean believes that during the crisis, one of the oxygen masks the two pilots were wearing was yanked out of its socket. The cockpit would then have been filled with the contents of the oxygen bottle, which is a highly flammable gas, and could easily cause an explosion. Captain Zaharie was already on his feet and trying to deal with the flames - but First Officer Fariq would have been incinerated as he tried to control the plane. An explosion of this size would have weakened the windshield of the aircraft, which would in turn have caused a rapid decompression. In these situations, oxygen masks would fall from the overhead compartments, giving passengers 12 minutes of air in the out of control plane. Ean then says Captain Zaharie could have fled the cockpit to reach an oxygen mask before he fell unconscious before making his way back into the front of the plane. With the communication equipment destroyed in the explosion, the captain then had a truly horrifying decision to make. He had just minutes of oxygen left and many of the passengers were dead or already in comas as their air supply ran out. Captain Zaharie could either try to crash land over Penang, a heavily built up area, and possibly save himself and the flight attendant who had helped him back into the cockpit but at huge risk to the thousands of people on the ground. Or he could divert the aircraft over the Southern Indian Ocean and crash land in the sea. It would mean everyone on board would perish but would save the lives of the innocent people on the land below. While many have doubted this theory, one key element does give it some credibility. When Captain Zaharie re-entered the cockpit it would have automatically switched the satellite communications system back on. Mystery has surrounded why it was switched off and then back on again."
13,Paul Pogba receives more bad news as Bruno Fernandes impresses for Man Utd,https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/paul-pogba-receives-more-bad-21662059,"Manchester United were counting down the days until Paul Pogba returned from injury, but since Bruno Fernandes signed in January, the Red Devils have a new focus  Paul Pogba is going to have to fight for his place at Manchester United when he returns from injury, because it doesn't feel like he's needed anymore.  That's the opinion of Paul Ince, who thinks Bruno Fernandes has stolen the Red Devils midfielder's thunder since signing in January. United were counting down the days until Pogba returned to the first team prior to the club splashing out on the Portugal international.  But since Fernandes first pulled on the United jersey, the Old Trafford club have been rejuvenated, and are brushing teams aside including Chelsea,Manchester City,Watford and Club Brugge.   Last time out Fernandes inspired United to victory over Manchester City at Old Trafford.  Ince is no longer convinced the Red Devils need Pogba as a result, and believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may look to leave the midfielder out when he finally returns from injury.  ""Fans thought Paul Pogba was going to be the star. But, look how that panned out,"" Ince told Paddy Power News. ""If he still wants to leave I'd say it would be far easier for Ole to do so now that Bruno is around. It doesn't feel like they need him anymore. ""His truly great games have been few and far between, so the current situation could suit club and player. ""If he does come back before the end of the season, he's not even going to get in the team. He's going to have to fight for his place â€“ if he even gets one.""   * For more from Paddy Power's columnists, visit: news.paddypower.com  "

16,Coronavirus: Supermarket delivery time restrictions could be relaxed to meet surge in demand,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/coronavirus-supermarket-delivery-time-restrictions-21660962,"Deliveries from big chains like Tesco, Sainsbury's and ASDA could be made early in the morning or late at night if people are forced to order in while they're under COVID-19 self-isolation Time restrictions on getting a home delivery from your supermarket could be axed to help retail giants meet a huge surge in demand from the coronavirus. Supermarket bosses held crisis talks this evening with Environment Secretary George Eustice on how to help vulnerable people get home deliveries - if they are forced to self-isolate due to COVID-19 Customers have reported week-long delays for delivery slots as panic-buyers strip products like toilet paper and hand soap from shelves, despite government warnings not to.  Those deliveries are partly hemmed in by complex restrictions on when firms can turn up at your door - including in ""anti-social"" hours like the early morning or late at night. Now the government would widen the ability to make deliveries using a seldom-used power under the 1998 Competition Act. The Act bans supermarkets from ""abusing their position"" by working together over how they sell goods. But the government can suspend these rules if there is an ""exception and compelling reason"" - a power used four times in the last two decades, including in the 2012 fuel crisis. It is understood the possibility of triggering this exception for a fifth time was to be discussed in the conference call between supermarket giants and Mr Eustice this evening. A government source said: ""One of the issues which we are looking at very keenly is this idea of lifting restrictions on when supermarket home deliveries can take place, to give them greater flexibility."" Shoppers concerned about having to self-isolate amid the spread of coronavirus in the UK have sparked Christmas-level demand for some items. Tesco has limited the sale of goods such as pasta and long-life milk, while a number of major stores are joining them in restricting sales of hygiene products such as hand sanitiser. But shoppers have been assured there is ""no need"" to stockpile and warned against doing so, after images emerged of empty shelves in stores in some areas of the country. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said today's meeting would look at â€œsupport for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation."" He insisted the UK â€œcontinues to have a resilient supply chainâ€ and the government will ensure that â€œcontinues to be the caseâ€, with no need to panic-buy key goods. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs food supplies will continue even in the ""reasonable worst-case"" scenario. Speaking in the Commons, he said: ""We are confident that food supply will continue even in our reasonable worst-case scenario. ""We have been talking to the supermarkets for some time about this scenario."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the Government is in ""constant contact"" with major retailers to ensure supplies are available and that shelves are restocked as necessary. He told BBC Breakfast: ""There is absolutely no need for anybody to stockpile or anything like that. ""We are confident that theÂ supermarkets have the supply chains necessary to keep shelves stocked for people, so there really is no need for that (bulk-buying) to happen."" An industry source said the empty shelves are not reflective of any issues in supply chains. ""The only thing that's stopping shelves remaining stocked as normal is people buying more than they need,"" the source said. ""There is absolutely enough for people to get the normal amount."""
17,Dancing on Ice fans think Perri Kiely was 'robbed' as Phillip Schofield makes snide remark,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/dancing-ice-fans-think-perri-21657040,"Dancing on Ice host Phillip Schofield asked runner-up Perri Kiely an awkward question after Joe Swash's surprise victory Joe Swash was the surprise Dancing on Ice 2020 champion - but many viewers are claiming it was the wrong decision. Cheeky chappy Joe and pro partner Alex Murphy were crowned winners in a shock result that few saw coming. The couple saw off tough competition from Perri Kiely and Vanessa Bauer during an incredibly tight public vote. All three finalists received perfect scores of 40 for all of their dances with nothing to split them on the night, but Perri had the stand out performance wit his death-defying backflip. After announcing that Joe was the winner, Phillip told runner-up Perri that everyone thought he ""had it in the bag"". In response to the awkward remark, Perri said: ""I gave everything I wanted to. ""Joe has come so far. I've made a friend for life with Joe, he's like my brother."" The two men then embraced during an emotional moment before Joe and Alex lifted the trophy as Perri and Vanessa watched on. Some Dancing on Ice viewers were unhappy with the final result and took to Twitter to complain. One viewer said: ""The viewers has ripped off Perri, he should've won, considering he was more skillful in skating, consistent & talented than Joe. ""My instincts told me that this would happen. I am disappointed, cuz I definitely don't think Joe deserved to win, I'm being honest wid u."" ""How in the actual F**K did Perri & Vanessa not win #DancingOnIce?! They were robbed! ""Oh yes I know... weâ€™re in Britain where (outside of London) most people are inherently racist / it was a fix,"" added another. A third agreed: ""I'm sorry that the british public let you down @perrikiely you deserved to win. ""Joe Swash has done well and improved alot and deserved to be in the final. ""But Perri did a motherf*ckin BACKFLIP on the ice. Everything Perri did was what you wanted from a champion."" ""What the f*** happened? No way should Joe be crowned the winner!? ""Yes he was good but Perri should have won! He was robbed,"" said a fourth. Gobsmacked Joe nearly collapsed in surprise while his proud son Harry and girlfriend Stacey Solomon applauded alongside baby Rex. On how it felt to win, Joe said: ""Honestly, amazing. It is the most amazing experience. To share with Al."" Phillip claimed Joe was the most improved skater ""without question"" before Holly handed over the trophy. Many Dancing on Ice fans took to Twitter to praise Joe after he lifted the trophy with partner Alex. One viewer said: ""Well happy well done @realjoeswash you was the most improved and deserved to win #DancingOnIce"" ""Congratulations Joe. Brilliant win, very well deserved. Definitely most improved over the series,"" added another. A third said: ""All you ever need to know about Joe Swash...He put in blood,sweat and tears to win dancing on ice and then stood aside so his professional partner could lift the trophy"" ""A well deserved win for Joe, so happy for him. Its all about his journey, no dance experience for him,"" said a fourth. Perri risked serious injury during the live final by completing a death-defying backflip. No one has ever attempted the dangerous move on the show before, let alone when the stakes were at their highest. Even Perri seemed stunned that he had pulled off the sensational backflip as he wobbled but remained on his feet and hugged the pro skaters. Close friend Ashley Banjo jumped up on his seat and admitted he was ""lost for words"" and shaking. *Dancing on Ice airs Sundays on ITV at 6pm"
1,"Shopping, travel, events  What coronavirus means for consumers ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/shopping-travel-events-what-coronavirus-means-for-consumers,"That depends. If you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an â€œofficialâ€ seller, you are entitled to a refund, often automatically. For example, those who bought tour packages to go to the Italy v England Six Nations rugby match in Rome on 14 March â€“ which has been postponed â€“ will be offered a full refund or tickets for the new date. Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said: â€œFans worried about being left out of pocket as a result of these games being postponed should be entitled to a refund on their match ticket if they cannot make the new date. Unfortunately it will be harder to get a refund on any travel or accommodation booked for the match, unless these were purchased as part of a package deal.â€ Keep a close eye on venue and ticket agency websites, especially before you set off â€“ most are providing regular updates. If you opt not to go, there are a number of fan-to-fan resale websites, including Twickets, where you can sell your tickets and hopefully recoup your outlay. Also bear in mind that if you have purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the siteâ€™s (typically restrictive) terms and conditions. This is a tricky area and you may be fighting your case with large numbers of other people, but as a last resort you could turn to your credit or debit card provider to seek a section 75 claim or chargeback. Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, your credit card company is jointly and severally liable for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the retailer or trader. This right is useful if the retailer or trader has gone bust, or doesnâ€™t respond to your pressure, although the transaction must be over Â£100. Similarly, if you paid by debit card then you can seek a debit card chargeback. You canâ€™t apply for either if you paid by Bacs or direct bank transfer, however. The British Retail Consortium says shops have so far seen no effect on the numbers of customers entering stores, because coronavirus cases are still low and contained. But at the same time demand for home deliveries appears to be soaring. Last week, the delivery giant Ocado advised customers to place their orders early, due to â€œexceptionally high demandâ€. It said: â€œMore people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders. As a result, delivery slots are selling out quicker than expected.â€ Generally, shoppers are being advised to book a weekday delivery instead of a weekend one. â€œWeâ€™re unusually busy Friday to Saturday at the moment,â€ Ocado said. In reality, delivery slots are not disappearing that quickly. The government has told supermarkets to ensure they make provision for home delivery to vulnerable people in self-isolation, given that the government is advising people who have returned from badly affected coronavirus areas to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. There could be disruption further down the line if illness affects delivery drivers and other staff, but retailers have pledged to manage this as best they can. Itâ€™s always sensible to have a well-stocked freezer â€“ but this has gone much further, with supermarket shelves now being regularly emptied of basics such as toilet roll, hand sanitiser, tinned tomatoes and pasta due to panic-buying. Itâ€™s definitely best not to stockpile, as this will heap pressure onto the retail supply chain and deprive others such as the sick and the elderly whose need may be greater than yours. Panic-buying can also drive up prices. Some sellers on Amazon and eBay have already tried to cash in on coronavirus fears, with prices for hand sanitisers at 10 times usual rates. The situation relating to Italy is changing fast, but the travel trade association Abta warned on Monday that UK holidaymakers who had booked summer trips to the country faced losing money if they wanted to cancel now because of the coronavirus. It said people who had paid for package holidays not due to begin in the next few days would need to wait to see if the situation changed. On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FCO) updated its stance to advise against all but essential travel to parts of northern Italy, including Venice, Milan and Parma. Anyone imminently due to visit the locations named by the FCO on a package holiday should be offered alternative arrangements by their travel provider and a full refund if there are no suitable options. If a tour operator refuses, customers may be entitled to compensation under the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements 2018 regulations. But Abta said it was too early to say that summer holidays could not go ahead as planned. â€œIf you cancel early you may have to pay cancellation charges,â€ it added."

4,Russia  Moscow 'hired network of Britons to go after enemies of Putin' ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/russia-network-britons-enemies-vladimir-putin-report,"Russia has been accused of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to help advance its criminal interests and to â€œgo afterâ€ Vladimir Putinâ€™s enemies in London, MPs who drew up the Russia report suppressed by Boris Johnson were told. In secret evidence submitted to parliamentâ€™s intelligence and security committee (ISC), the campaigner and financier Bill Browder claimed Moscow had been able to â€œinfiltrateâ€ UK society by using well-paid British intermediaries. Some had â€œreason to know exactly what they are doing and for whomâ€, Browder told the committee. Others â€œwork unwittingly for Russian state interestsâ€, he said. The alleged intermediaries include politicians from both Labour and the Conservative parties, former intelligence officers and diplomats, and leading public relations firms. Collectively, they form what Browder calls a â€œwestern buffer networkâ€. There is no suggestion in Browderâ€™s testimony that British citizens broke the law. The regime in Moscow uses these professionals to mask its â€œentangledâ€ state and criminal interests, he alleged. It deploys them to attack Putin critics, â€œenhance Russian propaganda and disinformationâ€ and to â€œfacilitate and conceal massive money-laundering operationsâ€, he said.  Putinâ€™s spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Browderâ€™s claims false and â€œtotally groundlessâ€. Questions about corruption at the heart of the Russian state were â€œa perfect example of a maniac-style Russophobiaâ€, Peskov said. With his permission, the Guardian is publishing Browderâ€™s previously confidential evidence to the ISC. The committee carried out a two-year investigation behind closed doors into how the Kremlin is seeking to influence and subvert UK politics and society. Its 50-page report was ready for release last November, before the election. The prime minister was accused of refusing to publish it. Downing Street cleared the document after the election. It claims the final document contains little new information and is underwhelming â€“ although others who have read it disagree. Opposition MPs said Browderâ€™s evidence demonstrated the need to publish the report as soon as possible. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, wrote to Johnson a month ago asking for a timetable for the reportâ€™s publication, which requires Downing Street to appoint a new nine-member cross-party committee of MPs and peers. But nearly three months after the election, that process is only in its early stages, and it is likely to be a few weeks at least before the long-awaited report is able to be issued, partly because new members need to be vetted before they can sit. Browder was one of several expert witnesses invited to give evidence to MPs and peers. In September 2018 he submitted a 14-page statement, which included a number of recommendations. They include setting up a US-style register of individuals working for foreign state interests, as well as extra resources for regulators, investigators, police and prosecutors. He calls on Companies House in London to review filings made by firms linked to Russian money-laundering scandals. Speaking to the Guardian, Browder said: â€œYes, there are members of the Russian security services working out of the Russian embassy under diplomatic cover. What the government seems to be missing is the fact that there are all sorts of informal espionage networks. â€œThere are Russian oligarchs who have a much greater impact on the security of this country. Whatâ€™s most shocking is that the Russian government is indirectly hiring British nationals to assist them in its intelligence operations.â€ Browder argues that the Russian state and organised crime have in effect merged. Money stolen from the budget and private companies is used to enrich senior officials â€“ including Putin â€“ and to finance â€œblack ops and special projectsâ€, he told the ISC. The Kremlin has issued multiple Interpol warrants for Browderâ€™s arrest and says he is a criminal. It has convicted him in absentia of tax evasion and deliberate bankruptcy. Browder says he is the victim of a vendetta by corrupt state officials. He denies all charges. Browderâ€™s fund, Hermitage Capital Management, was once the biggest foreign investor in the Russian market. He fell out with the authorities after â€“ he says â€“ calling for a clean-up of companies in which Putin and his inner circle have financial interests. In 2005 Russia deported him from Moscow. Officials linked to the FSB spy agency subsequently stole $230m in taxes paid by the fund to the Russian treasury, Browder alleges. In 2009 his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in custody. Browder persuaded the US and some other western governments to sanction senior officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses. The Kremlin was furious. It paid British firms to â€œadvance a false narrative of the fraudâ€, Browder told the ISC. One official allegedly involved, Andrey Pavlov, made an unsuccessful attempt to keep his name off a European parliament sanctions list, hiring the Labour former attorney general Lord Goldsmith to lobby on his behalf. Goldsmithâ€™s law firm received a Â£75,000 fee, Browder claims. The firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, said it could not comment on confidential client matters but that Pavlov denied wrongdoing. It added: â€œEveryone is entitled to legal representation. Debevoise provides legal representation consistent with the professionâ€™s best traditions of integrity and probity. We will continue fearlessly to defend the interests of all our clients.â€ Pavlov retained the services of GPW, a business intelligence company run by a former MI6 officer, Andrew Fulton. Browder says GPWâ€™s brief included gathering intelligence on him. Fulton â€“ a chairman of the Scottish Conservative party â€“ left GPW in 2017. Its managing director, Philip Worman, said he could not comment on â€œany aspect of our workâ€. Fultonâ€™s former GPW colleague Andrew Wordsworth said Pavlov was entitled to know the facts of his case: â€œThe use of sanctions against individuals is a pretty draconian remedy. Some people would argue that before you destroy peopleâ€™s lives they should be able to defend themselves.â€ In his evidence Browder alleges that Pavlov also hired Lynton Crosbyâ€™s communications firm CTF, paying it Â£45,000. However, CTF denies Browderâ€™s allegations. It says Goldsmithâ€™s law firm hired a separate entity, CTF Corporate & Financial Communications (CTFCFC), to â€œresearch the EU sanctions landscapeâ€. CTFCFC advised the law firm and there was no contact with Pavlov. â€œThis was the extent of our involvement and to try and claim otherwise would be utterly false,â€ it said. According to Companies House records, Crosby is a CTFCFC director. There is no suggestion Crosby personally worked on or was aware of the work on EU sanctions carried out by CTFCFC until it appeared in the media. â€œLynton Crosby was working exclusively on the 2015 general election campaign for the Conservative party at this time, and had no client involvement, outside of the Conservative party,â€ it said, adding that Crosby had never met or worked with Goldsmith or Debevoise. Browder further names British individuals who have fronted up offshore companies used in the alleged Magnitsky fraud and in other cases. The UK citizens appear as nominal directors of non-transparent firms in countries through which billions of dollars have been laundered, including the UK, Russia, Ukraine, Cyprus and Latvia."
5,"Scotland  Salmond believes women consented to sexual contact, jury hears ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/09/alex-salmond-believes-women-consented-to-sexual-contact-jury-hears,"Alex Salmond believed three of the women who accuse him of sexual assault and intent to rape had consented to sexual contact, the jury at his trial has heard. The former first minister, 65, from Strichen, Aberdeenshire, has appeared at the high court in Edinburgh accused of sexually assaulting 10 women over a seven-year period between 2008 and 2014 and has denied all the charges. The 15 jurors, made up of nine women and six men, were told the former Scottish National party leader had been charged with one count of attempted rape, one of intent to rape, 10 of sexual assault â€“ some of which allegedly occurred numerous times â€“ and two of indecent assault. The jury was told Salmond believed three of the women consented to sexual contact in four of the alleged assaults, including a charge of intent to rape. In relation to one of the charges, the jury heard Salmond had an alibi because he denies being at the location where he was alleged to have sexually assaulted one woman. Lady Dorrian, the trial judge and lord justice clerk, Scotlandâ€™s second most senior judge, told members of the jury they should consider withdrawing if they had very strong positive or negative views about Salmond that would prevent them being impartial. â€œAs you will realise, the accused is a very well known public figure and the case has attracted a great deal of publicity. It follows that the injunction, indeed the requirement, is that any verdict must be in accordance with the evidence in this case is of particular significance,â€ Dorrian said. Nine of the charges relate to a number of alleged assaults on eight women at Bute House, the official residence for Scotlandâ€™s first minister in Edinburghâ€™s Georgian new town, including the attempted rape and intent to rape. One of the alleged offences is said to have taken place at Bute House eight days before the 2014 independence referendum. The attempted rape charge accuses Salmond, who was first minister between 2007 and 2014, of allegedly blocking the path of a woman in a bedroom at Bute House, removing her clothing and his clothes, touching her breasts and pushing her on to a bed where it is alleged that he tried to rape her in June 2013. In the intent to rape charge alleged to have taken place in December 2013, he is accused of lying on top of a woman on a bed at Bute House, touching her breasts and bottom, and pulling up her dress with the intention of raping her. The other charges involve alleged assaults at various locations including in Baillieston, Glasgow, in 2008; a nightclub in central Edinburgh in 2010 or 2011; a car travelling from Holyrood Road to Waverley station in Edinburgh in 2011; at the Scottish parliament at various times between 2011 and 2013; at Stirling Castle in November 2014; and the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant in the west end of Glasgow in 2012. With the exception of the two indecent assault charges, 12 of the charges are offences under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 and carry a potential sentence of life imprisonment and fines."
0,"New York Stock Exchange 'kill switch' STOPS trading for 15 minutes after 7% fall as Dow craters 2,000 points amid coronavirus 'pandemonium' and Saudi-Russia oil price war - but STILL Trump blames fake news and Dems for 'inflaming' crisis",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8091531/Dow-opens-1700-points-amid-coronavirus-pandemonium.html,"Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for 15 minutes on Monday because stocks tumbled so drastically in the first few minutes as a result of global coronavirus panic and an oil price war sparked by Saudi Arabia. The Dow opened on a loss of more than 1700 points on Monday, adecrease of more than seven percent since Friday's close, after a chaotic weekend which saw oil prices tumble and which all but decimated the futures market. Circuit breakers - which are rarely triggered but exist to stop prices tumbling further when a downward spiral shows no sign of slowing - went into effect on Monday morning after a dramatic start. After a 15 minute break, the stock exchanged re-opened but it had slipped further, losing 2,000 points in total.If prices drop to 13 percent from Friday's close, trading will stop for another 15 minutes. Then, it will take for them to drop by 20 percent to stop for another 15 minutes. Monday's opening marked the worst start on Wall Street since the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 which triggered the GFC. Oil prices are at their lowest since the Gulf War thanks to a fallout between Russia and Saudi Arabia which may trigger an all-out price war that could harm the world's economy even more. Last week, Russia refused to agree to the terms of a deal that would slash the world's oil production rates. In retaliation, Saudi Arabia vowed to boost production and slash prices, a move which threatens to saturate the world's market with cheap oil as demand for it plummets thanks to the virus. Scroll down for video It exasperated the problem and now, has created an even bigger one. 'Crude has become a bigger problem for markets than the coronavirus. 'It will be virtually impossible for the [S&P 500] to sustainably bounce if Brent continues to crater, he added,'Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said Sunday. As on Monday morning; Despite the financial chaos, President Trump tweeted about that it was 'fake news' and that Democrats were to blame for mass hysteria. 'The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant,' he tweeted. 'Great job being done by the Vice Presidentand the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you! 'The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world! 'So much FAKE NEWS!,' he said in others. He also said more Americans die every year from the common flu than of coronavirus. He later blamed the financial chaos entirely on Saudi Arabia and Russia's dispute. Analysts are anxious over when the panic will subside. Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, wrote in a Monday memo that investors were waking up 'shell shocked' and that the virus had caused 'complete pandemonium'. He described the Saudi Arabia price war with Russia over oil prices combined with the already nervous markets as a 'one two punch' which added 'another level of unwanted panic to a market already thick with fear.' Johannes Benigni, chairman and founder of JBC Energy Group, told CNBC on Monday: 'We are experiencing, within a short period of time, a demand shock with corona and a supply shock now with OPEC. 'We are making history here...you can call it now a world war of oil. 'It is not that actually Saudi Arabia is taking on Russia which everyone is talking about. They may do that, but Russia always said they want to take on a little bit more of the shale industry.' 'By Saudi Arabia actually now declaring war, they are front-running the Russians in declaring war on U.S. shale.' Saudi Arabia slashed its oil export prices over the weekend and declared a price war with Russia that sent global markets reeling and marked the sharpest decline in oil futures since 1991. The price drop came after Russia refused to sign on with a proposal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production globally as the coronavirus outbreak has slowed the demand for oil. OPEC nations met with allies like Russia on Thursday and Friday in Vienna to reduce oil production by an additional 1.5million barrels per day to stabilize the market starting in April through the end of the year. But Russia refused to join to agreement. From Russia's perspective cutting production would boost US oil producers at the expense of international competitors and lead to a loss in profits. On Saturday, after the group failed to come to a consensus, Saudi Arabia - which runs the world's large oil company Saudi Aramco - slashed its export oil prices to saturate the market and trigger a price war aimed at Russia. Saudi Arabia slashed crude prices to Chinese customers by as much as $6 to $7 a barrel and is looking to boost output by as many as 2million barrels a day. China is the world's biggest oil importer and has purchased oil at cheap prices to stockpile for future use in the past. As a result the Brent global oil benchmark fell dramatically on Sunday by 30 percent,dropping to $31.02 a barrel at its lowest. US West Texas Intermediate crude, the other main price benchmark for oil, dropped 27% to $30 per barrel - the lowest level since February 2016. Sunday's decline in the oil market was the sharpest slump in 29 years since the Gulf War in 1991. Global stock markets took hits on Sunday with the Tokyo stock market index plunging 6.2 percent, Hong Kong 3.9 percent, Sydney 6.1 percent, and Riyadh eight percent. The failed talks marked the first break in a three-year alliance between Saudi Arabia led byCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The alliance was key to competing with a surge in American oil production that turned the US into a major crude exporter for the first time in decades. In response to the price cut Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could, as per Bloomberg. 'If you are Russia, itâ€™s worth it for you to take a three-month price hit to see if you can knock out U.S. oil exports,' Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil and Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said to the New York Times. 'They might be correct for three months but the shale never gets destroyed.' Jaffe said the disagreement between the two nations 'signals that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia is on the skids.' Analysts speculate the actions over the weekend may have been a game between Saudi Arabia and Russia that will end when they come to a compromise. If not, oil prices could tumble to the lowest level in five years. The oil price war is hammering aviation and energy stocks. In early trading, BP was down by 18 percent, Royal Dutch Shell was down 14 percent and ExxonMovil was down 11 percent. Ordinarily, a slump in oil prices offers a boost for airlines because their fuel costs are low. But with the ever-shrinking demand for flights due to the virus, they have been left unable to capitalize. The coronavirus crisis, which has now infected more than 110,000 people globally, has crippled supply chains and prompted cuts to global growth forecasts for 2020. There is no sign that the spread is close to slowing down, either. Traders are now expecting the Federal Reserve to again cut interest rates next week after an emergency reduction on March 3, putting the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury on course for its biggest one-day fall in almost a decade. Shares of rate-sensitive U.S. banks Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo & Co and Morgan Stanley slid between 7.4 percent and 9.6 percent. Marathon Oil Corp, Devon Energy Corp, Apache Corp, Pioneer Natural Resources Co slipped between 22 percent and 28 percent and were some of the biggest losers among S&P 500 components. At 7:12 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 1,255 points, or 4.87p ercent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 145 points, or 4.89 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 410 points, or 4.82 percent. Much of the chaos has been sparked by the failure of a deal between OPEC Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC leader Russia. Generally, the world's largest oil producers agree on production rates and cuts in order to stabilize the industry. With coronavirus slowing demand for supply, they met last week with Russia, which is not part of OPEC but is a large oil producer, to discuss cutting production. Russia refused, setting in motion a chain of events described by analysts as a 'worst case scenario' that could descend into an all-out price war."

James Cai, 32, fell ill last weekend while attending a medical conference at a hotel in Times Square. He has been hospitalized since Tuesday at the Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, New Jersey. So far, 13 people have been tested for COVID-19 in New Jersey. The other 11 cases have come back negative. 'Every day is getting worse,' Cai said Monday during an interview with CBS, adding that 'it happened so quick'. 'A lot of people say itâ€™s OK, donâ€™t wear masks. I donâ€™t believe that,' Cai said. Cai, who works and lives in Manhattan and Fort Lee, New Jersey, said the virus is not one to be taken lightly. In New York, where Gov Andrew Cuomo recently declared a state of emergency, cases of the coronavirus have shot to 142. Scroll down for video Cai told the network that he's not a smoker and had no underlying health conditions before contracting the virus. Bergen County Executive Jim Tedesco said Cai was in New York over the weekend, went to work last Monday in New York, felt ill and came to Fort Lee Monday evening and then sought treatment. Tedesco stressed 'there was no known contact with anyone here in Fort Lee'. Ihor Sawczuk, a doctor at Hackensack University Hospital, said Cai is 'resting comfortably and doing well'. Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich said Cai lives with his family in New York but has an apartment in Fort Lee and doesn't have school-age children. 'This case is not related to any other cases that we are aware of,' Sokolich said, referring to theWestchester, New York, cases. Following Cai's diagnosis, a woman in her30â€²s tested positive for the new coronavirus, becoming New Jersey's second case. Acting Gov Sheila Oliver said Thursday that the new case involves a Bergen County woman with mild symptoms, who is in isolation at home. The details came late Thursday, after a news conference when state officials disclosed that the patient had earlier been hospitalized in Englewood, Bergen County, not far from the city. 'As we said in the past, we would not be surprised to see cases in New Jersey,' Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said in a statement. 'But most New Jersey residents are at very low risk of contracting COVID-19.' The details about the second patient came only hours after authorities disclosed information about the first patient. Tedesco said some Bergen County residents who have had contact with people in the Westchester County community where the virus has spread are self-quarantining, but he didn't say how many. There is no further information regarding the second case. It's not yet known how the two patients got the virus. Persichilli said the Health Department is continuing 'infection control options' and asking those who were in contact with the patients to self-quarantine for at least two weeks. Oliver also announced that international travel for state workers is banned for now and said that domestic travel for state workers would need to get approval from the governor's office. Both cases are labeled as 'presumptive' and have been sent to the CDC for confirmation. These developments came as federal health officials said they were providing the state with $1.75million in what they called initial funding to respond to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The US House also passed an $8.3billion bipartisan bill to combat the virus earlier Wednesday. Last month, Democratic Gov Phil Murphy set up a task force to prepare for handling the virus, and Persichilli said a crisis management team has been meeting daily. Persichilli said the state has 700 hospital rooms capable of isolating patients, if needed. Murphy is out of the state after having had surgery to remove what he said was likely a cancerous tumor on his kidney. Officials confirm three new cases in New York City as Mayor Bill de Blasio urges New Yorkers to bike or walk to work Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that three more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in New York City. The mayor urged people to bike or walk to work and to avoid using the subway unless it is essential. The number of cases in New York state jumped to more than 100 over the weekend, including the three new infected patients in New York City. Of the three new patients, two are from Brooklyn and one is from Queens. As the number of cases continued to rise, de Blasio urged New Yorkers to try to reduce overcrowding and acknowledged that subway cars made it difficult for people to avoid direct contact with those who could be potentially infected. Gov Cuomo said on Sunday that officials are working hard to identify new cases but have been greatly hindered by the CDC, saying it is 'outrageous and ludicrous' that the agency has not authorized private labs to conduct automated tests. 'CDC, wake up. Let the states test. Let private labs test. Let's increase as quickly possible our testing capacity so we identify the positive people, so we can isolate them,' the governor said on Sunday. New York currently has seven private labs that could begin running automated tests immediately - processing as many as 2,000 samples per day, Cuomo said. That's a significant improvement on the current rate of roughly 100 per day with manual tests. It was later revealed on Monday that Rick Cotton, the head of New York's Port Authority has tested positive for coronavirus. Cuomo said that Cotton - the executive director of the Port Authority of NY/NJ - is now working from home. He said Cotton had been on the ground at various airports, which the Port Authority controls. Members of his team are being tested and are currently being self-quarantined. There are now 142 cases in New York state with 19 of those in New York City and 98 in Westchester where a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week. Cuomo also unveiled a new state-made sanitizer on Monday.Speaking about the new sanitizer, Cuomo said it was made up of 75 per cent alcohol and will be provided to facilities including schools, the MTA, government run buildings and prisons. The governor said the state currently has the capacity to make 100,000 gallons of the sanitizer per week, adding that it is cheaper for officials to make it instead of buying it on the market. It is being manufactured by Corcraft, which is the company that relies on prisoners in New York to make products, and is being made by inmates at the Great Meadow correctional facility. The state-made sanitizer costs about $6 per gallon to produce, according to Cuomo. He said the production stemmed from reports of price gouging on sanitizer. There are a total of 616 confirmed cases in the United States. A total of 22 people have died from the virus, 19 people in Washington state, two in Florida and one in California. Eight people have recovered from the virus that has spread to 109 countries and infected 111,356 people globally. A total of 3,892 have died from the virus while 62,375 people have recovered. New York Stock Exchange 'kill switch' stops trading for 15 minutes after 7% fall As a result of the global coronavirus panic, trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for 15 minutes on Monday because stocks tumbled so drastically in the first few moments of trading. The Dow opened on a loss of more than 1700 points on Monday, a decrease of more than seven per cent since Friday's close, after a chaotic weekend which saw oil prices tumble and which all but decimated the futures market.

President Donald Trump claims the market plunge is 'GOOD for the consumer' because oil prices are coming down Despite the mounting death toll and the huge market plunge, Trump has claimed that everything is 'good'. 'Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!' Trump tweeted Monday. The president then accused the media of 'inflaming' the virus outbreak and dismissed the collapse in oil prices as the result of Saudi Arabia and Russia 'arguing'. As the Dow Jones lost a year's gains, he was shuttling across Florida from Mar-a-Lago to a $100,000-a-head fundraiser. 'Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,' Trump continued in another tweet Monday morning. 'That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!' Trump has not addressed the economic impact of the coronavirus and instead said that the flu was worse than COVID-19. 'So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,' Trump cited in a tweet. 'Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,' he insisted. Thousands prepare to disembark Grand Princess cruise ship hit by coronavirus off the coast of San Francisco Federal and state officials in California prepared to receive thousands of people Monday from a cruise ship that has been idling off the coast of San Francisco with at least 21 people aboard infected with the coronavirus. Personnel covered head to toe in protective gear woke up passengers on the Grand Princess to check whether they were sick. Michele Smith, of Paradise, California, said a doctor knocked on her and her husbandâ€™s cabin before dawn and asked if they had a fever or a cough. The couple who went on the cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary are healthy and, like the rest of the 2,400 passengers aboard, have been isolating in their cabins since Thursday. On land, fences were installed at an 11-acre site at the Port of Oakland as authorities readied flights and buses to whisk the passengers aboard the ship to military bases or their home countries for a 14-day quarantine. The more than 3,500 passengers and staff on the ship hail from 54 countries. 'Weâ€™re making every effort to get them off the ship as safely and quickly as possible' said Dr John Redd of the US Department of Health and Human Services, who urged passengers to remain in their rooms. California Gov Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought to reassure the public that none of the Grand Princess passengers would be exposed to the US public before completing the quarantine. The Port of Oakland was chosen for docking because of its proximity to an airport and a military base, Newsom said. US passengers will be transported to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia, where theyâ€™ll be tested for the COVID-19 virus and quarantined. About 1,100 crew on the ship, 19 of whom have tested positive for the new virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere, Newsom said. Homeless people are twice as likely to contract and spread coronavirus as experts say they are 'a risk to society' They often donâ€™t have places to wash their hands, struggle with health problems and crowd together in grimy camps. Thatâ€™s what makes homeless people particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. Almost 200,000 people live in those conditions in the United States, according to a White House report, with Washington state, California and Oregon among the states most affected by homelessness as income inequality grows and housing costs rise. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  And â€” in a possible recipe for disaster â€” the new virus has hit hardest on the West Coast, where nearly all of the nationâ€™s deaths have occurred. Health officials have not yet reported coronavirus outbreaks among homeless populations, but tuberculosis and other diseases have swept through them in the past, underscoring their vulnerability. Yet few communities that are trying to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus have rolled out plans to protect the homeless and give them a place to recover in isolation, which would prevent them from passing it on. 'They are double risk. One is a risk to themselves, the other is a risk to society,' said Chunhuei Chi, director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University in Corvallis. King County, which includes Seattle and has seen most of the deaths in the US, is one of the few places thatâ€™s taken action: installing more than a dozen module units where infected homeless people can recover, some on county-owned land flanked by apartment buildings. The units, roughly the size of a mobile home that accommodate several people, were previously used by oil workers in Texas. County officials also bought a motel where coronavirus patients can recover in isolation. That approach needs to be replicated in many more places, said Chi, who has been closely following the global outbreak that originated in China. 'This should be treated as an emergency policy, not as a permanent solution to homelessness, but more of framing it as a solution for containing the spread,' Chi said. San Francisco says itâ€™s developing a plan to protect the homeless from the virus but hasnâ€™t released details yet Farther south, in Los Angeles County, the health department is sending teams to over 300 homeless facilities to ensure people are washing their hands and not sharing food or utensils, department director Barbara Ferrer said. Sheâ€™s urging shelters to prepare large spaces to isolate those who may become sick. Health officials in the nationâ€™s most populous county also are planning for a possible large-scale quarantine of homeless people in case the virus spreads, and will deploy street teams to work with those living in encampments to get people with symptoms treated. In Oregonâ€™s capital city, where a makeshift homeless camp has sprouted up on downtown Salem sidewalks, an agency that aids the homeless is bringing in hand-washing stations. 'The homeless population in our community would be in a very difficult position of following all the health care advice thatâ€™s coming out right now,' said Jimmy Jones, executive director of the agency Community Action. 'If youâ€™re in a homeless camp, itâ€™s very difficult to wash your hands. Itâ€™s very difficult to stay clean. Itâ€™s very difficult to practice good hygiene.' Experts say the homeless are more vulnerable because so many have underlying health conditions. So did many patients who have died. Jones said hepatitis C, heart disease and diabetes are prevalent among many of the 1,400 people who sleep on the streets, in cars or abandoned buildings, or in the woods and fields in Salem. 'If they get this particular virus, thereâ€™s a high degree of probability itâ€™s going to impact them more severely than it does the general population, with a higher mortality,' Jones said. Bill Gates' foundation is funding at-home coronavirus test kit that gives results in less than two days for hard-hit Seattle The billionaire and his charityare funding a new home-testing kit for the virus that is expected to be ready for distribution in the greater Seattle area in the coming weeks. The test will allow people experiencing symptoms of coronavirus to swab their noses and then send the samples to a lab for an analysis. The results would then be available within one to two days. Those who test positive would have those results shared with local health officials. Whoever is infected would then be asked to share information online about where they traveled to and with whom they were in contact."
2,Angelina Jolie reveals two of her daughters have undergone surgery: 'Fighting to survive and heal is something to be proud of',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8092297/Angelina-Jolie-reveals-two-daughters-undergone-surgery.html,"Angelina Joliehas revealed that two of her six children have undergone surgery in the last year. In aTime magazine essay published Sunday in honor of International Women's Day, Jolie wrote that her eldest daughter, 15-year-old Zahara, and one of her younger daughters (either Shiloh, 13, or Vivienne, 11) were operated on. The 44-year-old Maleficent actress did not go into much detail other than that younger child had work done to her hip. Jolie wrote that she was impressed by how the family came together during this time of pain, though there was no mention of the children's father, her ex-husband Brad Pitt. Jolie, who stars in the upcoming film Those Who Wish Me Dead, has bravely admitted to her own operations in the past - including a double mastectomy and having her ovaries removed as a preventative measure to ward off cancer. But this time she's speaking out about her children's procedures. 'I have spent the last two months in and out of surgeries with my eldest daughter and days ago watched her younger sister go under the knife for a hip surgery,' Jolie, a contributing editor for Time, began her essay. 'They know that I am writing this, because I respect their privacy and we discussed it together and they encouraged me to write.' While Jolie never said what Zahara was going through and she did not explain why the younger daughter had hip surgery, she did suggest it was serious. 'They understand that going through medical challenges and fighting to survive and heal is something to be proud of,' Jolie wrote. Describing how the children bonded, she wrote:'I have watched my daughters care for one another. My youngest daughter [Vivienne] studied the nurses with her sister, and then assisted the next time. 'I saw how all my girls so easily stopped everything and put each other first, and felt the joy of being of service to those they love. 'I also watched them their face fears with a resolute bravery.' 'We all know that moment when no one else can help us, and all we can do is close our eyes and breathe. When only we can take the next step or breath through the pain, so we steady ourselves and do it,' she wrote. The mother also brought up her other children - sons Knox, 11, Pax, 16, and Maddox, 18. 'Their brothers were there for them, supportive and sweet,' she wrote. 'But on this International Women's Day, writing from the hospital, I find myself focusing on my daughters for a moment, and all that I have learned from them and other young girls I have met around the world.' The actress, who was lastphotographed in early January while on a shopping trip with her daughter Vivienne, then focused on the power of women in honor of the holiday. 'Little girls' softness, their openness and instinct to nurture and help others, must be appreciated and not abused,' she stated. 'We must do much more to protect them, in all societies: not only against the extreme ways girls' rights are often violated, but also the more subtle injustices and attitudes that so often go unnoticed or excused.' 'So my wish on this day is that we value girls. Care for them. And know that the stronger they grow, the healthier they will be and the more they will give back to their family and community.' And Jolie ended on a message of empowerment. 'And my message to girls is, fight on, little ladies. Your care for each other will be a large part of your way forward,' she wrote. 'Hold your nerve. Know your rights. And never let anyone tell you that you are not precious and special and, above all, equal.' Whenever her kids have been injured it has become news.In 2014 Pax reportedly broke his leg in Thailand and Shiloh broke her arm during a ski accident in December 2017.

3,NY Gov Cuomo reveals head of the Port of Authority has coronavirus as Mayor de Blasio urges people not to take the subway and NY state makes its OWN 'superior' hand sanitizer,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8091549/Three-cases-coronavirus-confirmed-New-York-City.html,"The head ofNew York's Port Authority has tested positive for coronavirus as the number of cases in the state increased to 142 with 19 in New York City.  Governor Andrew Cuomo revealed on Monday thatRick Cotton - the executive director of the Port Authority of NY/NJ - had tested positive for coronavirus and was now working from home. He said Cotton had been on the ground at airports the Port Authority controls amid the outbreak. The Port Authority is in charge of all five airports in New York and New Jersey, including JFK, Newark and LaGuardia. Members of Cotton's team are now also being tested and are currently in self-quarantine. There are now 142 cases in New York state with 19 of those in New York City and 98 in Westchesterwhere a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week. Gov Cuomo also unveiled a new state-made sanitizer on Monday as he gave the update on the increased number of coronavirus cases after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend. Speaking about the new sanitizer, Gov Cuomo said it was made up of75 percent alcohol and will be provided to facilities including schools, the MTA, government run buildings and prisons. Westchester: 98 New York City: 19 Nassau, Long Island: 17 Rockland County: 4 Saratoga: 2 Suffolk County, Long Island: 1 Ulster County: 1 Cuomo said that state currently has the capacity to make 100,000 gallons of the sanitizer per week, adding that it is cheaper for officials to make it instead of buying it on the market. It is being manufactured byCorcraft, which is the company that relies on prisoners in New York to make products, and is beingmade by inamtes at the Great Meadow correctional facility. The state-made sanitizer costs about $6 per gallon to produce, according to Cuomo. He said the production stemmed from reports of price gouging on sanitizer. It comes afterNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged people to bike or walk to work and to avoid using the subway unless it is essential. As the number of cases continued to rise, de Blasio urged New Yorkers to try to reduce overcrowding and acknowledged that subway cars made it difficult for people to avoid direct contact with those who could be potentially infected. He encouraged people to bike or walk to work if they weren't able to work from home. 'We need everyone to do their part in reducing overcrowding. I know that sounds impossible in New York City, but consider some basic steps like telecommuting if your job allows it,' de Blasio tweeted. 'Stagger work schedules so people can arrive later or leave earlier to beat the busiest times of rush hour. 'Plan to have some extra travel time in your commute. If the train that pulls up is too packed, move to a different car or wait to take the next one. Bike or walk to work if you can.' Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  The main cluster of cases in the state remains inWestchester Countywhere a Manhattan attorney was first struck down with the virus early last week and subsequently infected his family and others. Elsewhere in the tri-state area, New Jersey has six cases and Connecticut has reported one case. The outbreak has resulted in a number of schools canceling or suspending in person classes in New York and New Jersey. In New York, Columbia University,Yeshiva University andHofstra University have suspended in-person classes. TheSomers Central, East Ramapo and Scarsdale school districts have also closed.  New Jersey's Princeton University is moving all classes online and will encourage students to remain at home after spring break instead of returning to campus. Mount Olive, South Brunswick, Cranford and Wayne Township school districts have closed temporarily in New Jersey. De Blasio told CNN on Monday that there was a 'high bar' and he doesn't anticipate mass closures for schools. It comes after Gov Cuomo on Saturday announced a state of emergency as the coronavirus continued to spread in the northeastern state. He said the state of emergency 'allows expedited purchasing and expedited hiring, which are the things we need now'. Cuomo said that by declaring a state of emergency, he is able to free up $30 million that can be used for testing and the purchase of protective gear for healthcare workers. The authorities are now 'aggressively testing' 24 hours a day, he said. 'We want to find positives... (then) we can put them in an isolated situation.That's the point of the exercise. You isolate them and you slow the spread.' Cuomo described Westchester, which is where the infected Manhattan attorney lives, as an 'obvious problem'. 'We talk about contagion in clusters; clusters tend to infect more and more people,' he said. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, retirement homes and nursing facilities in the New Rochelle area are banning visits by outsiders. 'We are (being) hypercautious,' Cuomo said. 'I'm not urging calm... I'm urging reality. I'm urging a factual response as opposed to an emotional response... that people understand the information and not the hype.' He added that, at present, there was no need to cancel large gatherings in any part of the state. Cuomo said the quarantine period of 14 days for infected people might be extended. Cases are expected to continue to rise higher amid fears that 40 doctors, nurses and medical staff in a Queens hospital may have been infected by an Uber driver who walked into the hospital and later tested positive for the virus. Meanwhile, more than 4,000 people in the state have been urged to self-quarantine to prevent the spread of the disease. Most of those are New York City residents who have returned from the coronavirus hotspots of China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea within the past 14 days. More than half of all U.S. states have reported cases of the coronavirus, which originated in China last year. The US death toll from the disease is currently at 22 with the majority being from Washington state following an outbreak at a nursing home just outside Seattle."
4,Roadblocks and checkpoints are set up in northern Italy to contain the 16million people under coronavirus lockdown - as the Prime Minister makes impassioned plea for citizens to obey quarantine rules,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8090779/Italian-PM-makes-impassioned-plea-16-million-obey-quarantine.html,"Alarming new pictures show coronavirus patients being treated in intensive care at a hospital in northern Italy, where 16million people are facing quarantine in a drastic new lockdown. The photos show patients surrounded by wires and tubes being treated by medics in full protective suits with gloves, goggles and face masks at the hospital in Cremona. Some patients are lying face-down on their hospital beds, which researchers believe can raise survival rates in intensive care by improving oxygen levels in the blood. The hospital is in Lombardy which is one of the regions sealed off in the toughest quarantine measures that any country has imposed outside China. Italy's prime minister last night pleaded with his citizens to obey the draconian new measures, declaring that 'this is the time to be responsible' after the quarantine took effect in cities including Milan and Venice. 'We want to protect the health of all citizens, we are aware that this will create unease and that these measures will be a sacrifice, big and small,' Giuseppe Conte said in an address last night. 'But this is the time to be responsible. We all must respect and not dodge these measures. 'We should not counter these measures or dodge them, we must think about protecting our health, the health of our beloved ones, the health of our parents, but mainly the health of our grandparents,' he said, warning that older people have proved the most vulnerable to the virus. Italian police were today setting up checkpoints in Lombardy after the wealthy northern region and 14 other provinces were placed into lockdown in a measure which will last until at least April 3. Only people with a 'serious' reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, will be allowed in or out of the 'orange zones'. Anyone who breaks the rules without justification could face three months in prison or a 200-euro fine in a draconian new effort to tackle the crisis. The crisis deepened even further yesterday as Italy's death toll soared from 133 to 366, becoming the highest in the world outside China. The number of confirmed cases in the country also surged by 1,492 to 7,375, making the scale of the Italian outbreak worse than South Korea's. To make matters worse, six people died yesterday in one of several jailhouse riots after prisoners revolted over new rules which banned them from seeing their families over coronavirus fears. Airlines including British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet are still flying passengers to and from coronavirus-ridden regions of northern Italy after swathes of the country were put on lockdown. Return flights to Milan - one of the cities under lockdown - are still being offered by Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways and are all available to book online. Britons returning home from the worst-hit regions are not being checked for the virus upon landing in the UK. The Foreign Office confirmed that nationals returning from northern Italy - the worse-affected region - will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug. British Airways are 'reviewing their schedule' and have offered customers travelling from the quarantined zone full refunds. Customers who booked with BA - which has already scrapped hundreds of long-haul flights due to the killer bug - before April 2 have the option to change theirbooking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead. Meanwhile EasyJet will cancel some flights to and from the region up until April 3 - when the lockdown affecting 16 million people and covering much of the north - including Milan will end. The Foreign Office advises 14 days of self isolation once back in Britain - but there is nothing stopping people from using public transport or entering crowded places on their way home. People evacuated from Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - were quarantined for 14 days in an isolation compound. A BA spokesperson said: 'Following the change to the UK Government travel advice for Northern Italy, we are reviewing our schedule, and have contacted all customers who are due to travel today. 'We are also offering customers booked to fly before April 2, the option to change their booking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead.' An EasyJet spokesperson said: 'We will provide a further update on our schedule in due course.' Weddings and funerals have been banned under the tough new health measures while museums, cinemas, shopping centres and restaurants have all been hit by new restrictions. Bars and restaurants can remain open as long as customers stay three feet apart - but will be shut down if their guests are found to be getting too close to each other. Schools have already been shut down across the country until March 15, with schools and universities in Lombardy and the 'orange zone' areas due to remain closed until at least April 3. The Pope, who has been ill in recent weeks, held his Sunday blessing by video instead of in person and described feeling like he was 'in a cage'. Italian police will be setting up controls at train stations to check people's temperatures, and stopping all cars on main roads in and out to verify the reason for travel, officials said. Cruise ships will be forbidden from docking in Venice, with only passengers who are residents of the lagoon city allowed to disembark. Alitalia suspended national and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport, and announced it was operating only domestic routes from Milan Linate. The borders with Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia remain open. Speaking to La Repubblica, prime minister Conte also vowed a course of 'massive shock therapy' to aid the Italian economy after much of its industrial and business heartland was shut down. The Milan stock market, which was already down some 17 per cent since the outbreak in northern Italy, plunged at Monday's opening, with the blue chip FTMIB index down 11 per cent. Matching similar calls from France, Conte said strict European Union borrowing limits should be loosened to allow more room for manoeuvre, and that the flexibility envisaged by the EU's budget rules should be used 'in full'. 'Europe cannot think of confronting an extraordinary situation with ordinary measures,' he said. The European Commission told Italy on Saturday that its planned extra spending in response to the outbreak would not be counted in measuring its compliance with EU budget rules. 'The economic measures in the works will be vigorous, commensurate to current needs, but temporary,' the economy ministry said, adding that Italy remained committed to reducing its debt as soon as possible. The ministry also said it would 'spare no effort' in ensuring that measures were agreed at a European level. While a quarter ofItaly's population faces life in quarantine, Britons in the coronavirus-ridden zone are free to travel home without restrictions. British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet still have Milan flights available to book on their website. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that British tourists in the northern parts of the country 'are free to return home or complete their holiday' under guidelines from the Italian government. They said UK nationals will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug which has so killed more than 3,600 worldwide and has infected more than 100,000. The FCO updated its advice on Sunday night, advising against all but essential travel to a wider area of northern Italy due to the crisis. The move has been made following consultations with Italian authorities and the chief medical officer, the department said. Public Health England says all cabin crew are briefed on coronavirus symptoms and what to do if someone reports feeling ill onboard a flight. The captain is to call ahead to warn of any illness and a risk assessment will be carried out before passengers are let off the plane. It is possible to transmit the virus without any symptoms. A 'bespoke poster for Italy' will be given to travellers from Italy to inform them of what areas are affected. Information on symptoms and actions are provided to passengers. This protocol has been in place for northern Italy since March 4 and will be rolled out for the whole of Italy by March 11. Heathrow Airport says it has 'enhanced thorough cleaning processes and increased the amount of hand sanitisers for staff. Vincenzo Tosetti, a 34-year old actor and Venice resident, said that 'many people I know have fled, mainly from Milan. 'This is going to test the Italians' ability to behave responsibly, and I have to say that up until now they've been failing. There's been an exodus'. Fellow Venetian Giancarlo, 49, who did not want to give his last name, said 'you can feel the anxiety in the air'. The floating city was also virtually empty of tourists, which was 'a big blow'. 'First the city was hit by record floods [last autumn], now this. Venice is very fragile right now,' he said. The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions, and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy's less well medically equipped south. The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown - which include the cities of Parma and Rimini - to 'stop and turn around'. 'Get off (the train) at the first station, don't get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don't bring the epidemic to Puglia,' he said on Facebook. 'You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,' he said. Meanwhile, six prisoners have died after a series of jailhouse riots across Italywhich were sparked by tough new measures to stop the spread of the virus. Inmates set their prison on fire in Modena yesterday in an angry protest over a ban on family visits, unions said. Six inmates are confirmed to have died, including three who had been transferred to different prisons as authorities tried to quell the uprising. Justice ministry sources said two of the deaths in Modena were caused by an overdose from drugs found in the jail infirmaries, while a third prisoner was found blue in the face and their cause of death was still unclear. Police were today clashing with relatives who had gathered outside the jail, in northern Italy which is at the centre of the virus outbreak. The riot was one of several around the country with other disturbances taking place in Salerno, Naples and Milan among others. According to Il Corriere, a group of 60 inmates set fire to the prison in Modena after the tough new measures were announced. Footage broadcast by local media showed police and fire trucks outside the prison as black smoke swirled into the sky. Around 500 people were at risk of escaping until authorities laid siege to the penitentiary and eventually stormed the building. Once inside, they discovered a 'surreal scene and a devastated building', reports say, seizing a supply of drugs. The head of Italy's prison service, Francesco Basentini, said three inmates had at the jail and three others had died after being transferred to other prisons. 'There have been a series of rebellions across the country,' Basentini said in a televised interview. Prison officers' union Sappe said some 80 prisoners had been transferred to other jails after the uprising. 'The inmates that have been moved were those who managed to reach the yard in a bid to escape,' Seppe's secretary general Giovanni Battista Durante said. 'We are told other prisoners inside the jail have barricaded themselves in and probably have illegal weapons'. He said colleagues from the prison had told him the jail had been 'completely destroyed'. News of the impending quarantine was leaked to Italian media early, prompting further chaos as people rushed to get out of the affected areas. The leak infuriated Conte, who slammed it as 'unacceptable', saying it had created 'uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion'. Pina Antinucci, a psychoanalyst in her 60s who lives in Milan, told AFP she was suffering nightmares and felt the state was 'bombarding us with anxieties, spreading paranoia'. 'I'd like to know if I'm infected... it would be better to know if I have that unwanted guest who occupies our homes, minds and lives,' she said. Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who identified the Italian strain last month, said the leak had been a 'disastrous communication error' and 'absolute idiocracy'. Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak on Twitter as 'pure madness'. 'The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,' he said on social media. AirlineAlitalia said it was suspending national and international flights to and from Milan's Malpensa airport from March 9 after the government ordered a lockdown of large areas of northern Italy. In a statement, the Italian flag carrier said it would operate only national flights from the smaller Milan Linate airport, and reduce the number of flights between Venice and Rome. International routes will be served from Rome's Fiumicino airport. The new regime will continue until at least April 3, the airline said. Meanwhile, Pope Francis broke with centuries of tradition by enlisting the help of technology for his weekly Angelus prayer. 'I am close through prayer with the people who suffer from the current coronavirus epidemic,' the 83-year-old pontiff said in a message recorded at the Vatican library and aired live on a screen on Saint Peter's Square. The Pope himself tested negative for the contagion after he fell ill on Ash Wednesday with symptoms of a cold including a cough, fever, chills and sore throat. Italian football was also plunged into chaos as Serie A match between Parma and SPAL faced a last-minute delay following a call from Italy's sports minister to suspend the league during the outbreak. Players faced a75-minute wait for kick-off inside an empty stadium as officials considered an appeal from sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora minutes before the scheduled start. Spadafora said he supported a call from Italian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi to avoid putting players at risk amid the virus outbreak. Some had voiced growing anger over the idea of having to play matches during the coronavirus outbreak. 'It doesn't make sense right now, when we're requesting enormous sacrifices of our citizens in order to stop the spread of contagion, to put at risk the health of the players, referees, coaches and fans,' Spadafora said. The Italian league replied that it was following government orders to hold games in empty stadiums. 'The repeated and contrasting government statements only add to the general state of confusion and definitely don't help the system overcome the difficult time caused by the virus,' a league statement said. Five Serie A matches took place Sunday, beginning with Parma v Spal at lunchtime and concluding with Juventus v Inter Milan in the evening. All of the matches had already been postponed from last weekend. An appeal by Spadafora for this weekend's games to be shown on free TV 'considering the serious inconvenience affecting the population in this difficult time' was rejected by the league. 'The minister has gone from asking for the games to be shown for free to suspending the league, amid a decree to play behind closed doors,' Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini said. 'Italy needs clarity and gravitas right now, not populist proclamations.'"
5,How Saudi Arabia is trying to CRIPPLE Russian oil industry by flooding world market and dropping price to 30-year low in fight over coronavirus that could hit Trump's re-election hopes by triggering US recession,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8089973/How-Saudi-Arabia-trying-CRIPPLE-Russian-oil-industry-flooding-world-market.html,"Saudi Arabia slashed its oil export prices over the weekend and declared a price war with Russia that sent global markets reeling and marked the sharpest decline in oil futures since 1991. The price drop came after Russia refused to sign on with a proposal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production globally as the coronavirus outbreak has slowed the demand for oil. OPEC nations met with allies like Russia on Thursday and Friday in Vienna to reduce oil production by an additional 1.5million barrels per day to stabilize the market starting in April through the end of the year. But Russia refused to join to agreement. From Russia's perspective cutting production would boost US oil producers at the expense of international competitors and lead to a loss in profits. On Saturday, after the group failed to come to a consensus, Saudi Arabia - which runs the world's large oil company Saudi Aramco - slashed its export oil prices to saturate the market and trigger a price war aimed at Russia. Saudi Arabia slashed crude prices to Chinese customers by as much as $6 to $7 a barrel and is looking to boost output by as many as 2million barrels a day. China is the world's biggest oil importer and has purchased oil at cheap prices to stockpile for future use in the past. As a result the Brent global oil benchmark fell dramatically on Sunday by 30 percent,dropping to $31.02 a barrel at its lowest. US West Texas Intermediate crude, the other main price benchmark for oil, dropped 27% to $30 per barrel - the lowest level since February 2016. Sunday's decline in the oil market was the sharpest slump in 29 years since the Gulf War in 1991. Global stock markets took hits on Sunday with the Tokyo stock market index plunging 6.2 percent, Hong Kong 3.9 percent, Sydney 6.1 percent, and Riyadh eight percent. The failed talks marked the first break in a three-year alliance between Saudi Arabia led byCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The alliance was key to competing with a surge in American oil production that turned the US into a major crude exporter for the first time in decades. In response to the price cut Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could, as per Bloomberg. 'If you are Russia, itâ€™s worth it for you to take a three-month price hit to see if you can knock out U.S. oil exports,' Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil and Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said to the New York Times. 'They might be correct for three months but the shale never gets destroyed.' Jaffe said the disagreement between the two nations 'signals that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia is on the skids.' Analysts speculate the actions over the weekend may have been a game between Saudi Arabia and Russia that will end when they come to a compromise. If not, oil prices could tumble to the lowest level in five years. 'If a true price war ensues, there will be plenty of pain in the oil markets,'Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, a United Arab Emirates oil company, said to theNew York Times.'Many will be bracing for the economic and geopolitical shocks of a low-price environment.' If the oil market plunge doesn't stop it could lead to a US recession and threaten President Donald Trump's bid for re-election, experts say. 'We are in an Armageddon situation. We could move down 30% in the equity markets in the next 30 days. We are at floor 8 after a jump off a 20-story building,' analyst John Lekas, the CEO of Leader Capital based in Vancouver, Washington, said to Reuters. 'The 10 year is your growth rate, give or take a little. That means growth in essence went from a little over two to basically zero overnight. Two quarters of negative gross domestic product is a recession. We will most likely get that. 'It also puts U.S. President Donald Trump's election at risk. The market has not caught up to the facts.' A silver lining for the drop in oil prices is the reduced price of a gallon of regular gasoline at US gas stations. According to the AAA Motor Club, the cost of a gallon at the pump has already fallen five cents in the last week from $2.45 to $2.40. Prices could drop to below $2 per gallon in some states in the coming weeks, experts speculate. However, the price collapse could eventually harm American oil companies, as dozens have already gone out of business in recent years. Furthermore, the drop in global oil prices could lead to a decline in American oil production. A drop in oil prices could also hurt producers around the world - especially Venezuela and Iran, both of whose oil-based economies are under pressure from American sanctions. Saudi Arabia already felt the impact of the price drop, as shares of Saudi Aramco plummeted more than nine percent on Sunday - dropping below its December initial public offering price of 32 riyals ($8.53 USD) for the first time. The Saudi oil price cut was the largest cut in at least 20 years. The Riyadh stock exchange fell more than eight percent. Now Saudi Arabia is preparing to amp up their oil output to a reported 10million to 12 millionbarrels per day to compensate for the revenue lost. Saudi Arabia already produces a whopping 9.7million barrels of oil a day. 'Saudi Arabia is protecting its market position in the face of a collapse in oil demand, a shrinking physical market and greatly reduced prices,' Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, said to the Times. 'We believe the OPEC and Russia oil price war unequivocally started this weekend when Saudi Arabia aggressively cut the relative price at which it sells its crude by the most in at least 20 year,' Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said to clients in a statement Sunday. 'The prognosis for the oil market is even more dire than in November 2014, when such a price war last started, as it comes to a head with the significant collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus.' Saudi Arabia's audacious market move comes after the monarchy was rocked with scandal over the weekend. On Friday the brother and nephew of the Saudi king Salman were arrest over an alleged plot to oust him and his son Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason. Saudi royal guards detained the two and one other person, in a move that signaled Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's tightening grip on power. The brother and nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Salman have been arrested over a plot to oust the king and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason. They were taken from their homes early on Friday by black-clad royal guards, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Saudi royal court has accused the two men, once potential contenders for the throne, of 'plotting a coup to unseat the king and crown prince' and could face lifetime imprisonment or execution, the newspaper said. Prince Nayef, a once powerful figure as head of Saudi counter terrorism efforts, had been crown prince until 2017. King Salman took away the title and put his son - Prince Mohammed bin Salman - first in line for the throne. The New York Times also reported his and Prince Ahmed's detention, adding that Prince Nayef's younger brother, Prince Nawaf bin Nayef, had also been detained. The detentions mark the latest crackdown by Prince Mohammed, who has consolidated his grip on power with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites. Prince Mohammed has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October 2018. He was accused of ordering the journalist's murder, and the killing sparked calls for him to be replaced as Crown Prince. He was also accused of hacking the phone of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos after the pair swapped numbers. Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 84-year-old father King Salman. 'Prince Mohammed is emboldened - he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,' Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation, said of the latest crackdown. 'This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone - including royals - not to cross him.' Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy. Just before his return in October 2018, the prince had courted controversy over remarks he made to protesters in London chanting against Saudi royals over the kingdom's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Yemen. 'What does the family have to do with it? Certain individuals are responsible... the king and the crown prince,' he said, according to a widely-circulated online video of the incident. The comment was seen by many as rare criticism of the kingdom's leadership and its role in Yemen, but Prince Ahmed dismissed that interpretation as 'inaccurate'. Prince Mohammed had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, in 2017 to become heir to the Arab world's most powerful throne. At the time, Saudi television channels showed Prince Mohammed kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence. Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities. The same year that Prince Nayef was stripped of his crown prince status, Prince Mohammed ordered a sweeping crackdown, arresting senior members of the royal family and billionaire businessmen. He claimed it was a bid to tackle corruption. The group of the country's most powerful figures were held in a function room at the Ritz Carlton hotel in their home country. Pictures showed them sleeping on mattresses on the floor. A source told MailOnline at the time that the men were being strung up by their feet and beaten by American private security contractors. Among those arrested on allegations of corruption was Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Saudi King's nephew who is worth more than $17bn according to Forbes, and owns stakes in Twitter, Lyft and Citigroup. He was stripped of his position as National Guards chief. The Saudi crown prince, according to the source, also confiscated more than $194 billion from the bank accounts and seized assets of those arrested. The source said that Salman, often referred to by his initials MBS, was conducting some of the interrogations on the princes and billionaries himself. 'When it's something big he asks them questions,' the source said. 'He speaks to them very nicely in the interrogation, and then he leaves the room, and the mercenaries go in. The prisoners are slapped, insulted, hung up, tortured.' Prince Mohammed did win plaudits from Western leaders after he introduced some moderate reforms - allowing women in Saudi Arabia to drive for the first time ever and introducing cinemas to the country. The Crown Prince - also known simply as MBS - also reined in the country's fierce and ultra conservative religious police. Leaders including Theresa May and Donald Trump have rolled out the red carpet for him during his lavish visits. The latest detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam's holiest sites to contain the novel coronavirus. The kingdom has suspended the 'umrah' year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj - a key pillar of Islam. The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with the plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue."
6,"'Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on': Trump claims the market plunge is 'GOOD for the consumer' because oil prices are coming down and blames 'fake news' for historic market plunge",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8091389/Trump-ignores-market-plunge-death-toll-accuse-media-Dems-inflaming-coronavirus-crisis.html,"Donald Trump claimed the plunging stock market was 'good' for consumers because it is based on cheaper gas Monday as Wall Street faced a fall so dramatic trading was briefly halted. 'Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!' Trump tweeted Monday, one of a string of tweets accusing the 'fake news' of prompting the sell-off. He accused the media of 'inflaming' the virus outbreak and dismissed the collapse in oil prices as the result of Saudi Arabia and Russia 'arguing.' As the Dow Jones lost a year's gains, he was shuttling across Florida from Mar-a-Lago to a $100,000-a-head fundraiser - and tweeting that flu was worse than coronavirus. 'Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,' Trump continued in another tweet Monday morning. 'That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!' Markets all over the world plummeted Monday over the growing threat of the virus spreading, but Trump has not addressed the economic impact as the coronavirus death toll bypassed 20 in the U.S. Global markets opened with big losses Monday morning as the economy saw its worst day in more than 10 years. Trump continued to downplay the threat, citing that more people died from the flu last year, and insisting life and the economy will 'go on' even over the escalation in coronavirus outbreak. 'So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year,' Trump cited in a tweet. 'Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,' he insisted. 'At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!' The president has repeatedly expressed incredulity at the number of flu deaths, and the idea that people die of it. In 1918, his grandfather Freidrich died of Spanish flu. Trump claims that media outlets are working with Democrats to make the coronavirus outbreak seem worse than it is. 'The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant,' the president tweeted Monday morning. 'Surgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American,'' he continued, quoting U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams. 'So much FAKE NEWS!' he lamented in a separate tweet Monday morning. Trump's claims comes as the death toll in the U.S. reached 22 on Monday and cases continued to spread to new areas of the country, including the first confirmed case in Washington, D.C. Kansas and Missouri also announced their first cases over the weekend as the cases number now exceeds 600. The most U.S. deaths occurred in Washington state after the virus spread among residents at a nursing facility in a suburb of Seattle. But Trump insists the threat is less serious than is being portrayed by media reports and Democratic lawmakers. He then praised himself in another tweet Monday morning for banning travel from high-risk countries early on in the outbreak. 'The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives,' Trump lauded of his administration. 'Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world!' Trump stopped travel from certain countries to the U.S., including from China and Iran â€“ and Americans have been warned of traveling to other high-risk countries like Italy and South Korea. The president is usually the first to address stock market gains under his administration, but since coronavirus has caused markets to fall, he has remained largely silent on the matter. Earlier this month, the U.S. saw its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis and on Monday markets plunged nearly 7 per cent. Markets in Asia, Europe and the Middle East also opened sharply lower on Monday as investors came to grips with the global spread of coronavirus. Economic experts claimed Monday morning that investors are waking up 'shell shocked,' as oil markets crashed. The global market plunged, causing the worst one-day crash in crude oil prices in 30 years, after Saudi Arabia launched a price war. On Friday Russia refused to follow OPEC's efforts to stop market plummets caused by the escalation of the coronavirus outbreak. Last month, Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence to head the task force addressing the coronavirus crisis. 'Great job being done by the @VP and the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you!' Trump tweeted Monday. Coronavirus has infected more than 108,000 people worldwide and is throwing many countries' economies into turmoil. The number of confirmed cases in New York rose by 13 over the weekend, nearing the state total to 90. New York governor Andrew Cuomo issued a declaration of emergency in the state. But Trump claimed late Sunday night that the messaging from Cuomo is 'political weaponization' of the coronavirus. 'There are no mixed messages, only political weaponization by people like you and your brother, Fredo!' Trump insisted in his tweet, making reference to Cuomo's brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo."
7,Fauci compares coronavirus outbreak to the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and pre-pandemic bird flu and says 'there's still a lot that's unknown',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8091759/Fauci-compares-coronavirus-outbreak-early-days-HIV-AIDS-epidemic.html,"A top official at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has compared the coronavirus outbreak to the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Dr Anthony Fauci has been director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984 and was a central figure during the global crisis. He said that while the virus at the center of each are different, the fear and anxiety among the general public are similar. 'It's not that different than the very early years of the HIV epidemic, of the anthrax attacks, of the concern about the pre-pandemic bird flu,' Dr Fauci told CNN's New Day. 'Everything has a little bit of a different twist to it. It's not exactly the same, but there's always that uncertainty that gets people very anxious.' However, Dr Fauci also stressed that researchers are collecting new data every day because so much about the virus is unknown. 'We're gathering information, we're learning a lot, but there's still a lot that's unknown about where this is going,' he told hostAlisyn Camerota. 'You always almost have a fog of war about it.' Other recent comments from Dr Fauci signaled a change in tone from the administration regarding who is most at risk. He stated that those with underlying health conditions are much more likely to suffer complications if they contract the disease. ""If you are an elderly person with an underlying condition, if you get infected, the risk of getting into trouble is considerable,' he told Meet the Press on Sunday. 'If you're a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, you need to think twice about getting on a plane, on a long trip.' This echoes past remarks from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has stated that people with pre-existing conditions are twice as likely to have serious outcomes compared to healthy people. It comes as The Associated Press reports that the White House overruled a CDC warning advising elderly and 'physical fragile' Americans from flying. The CDC allegedly submitted the plan among a list of recommendations to control the spread of the virus, but the Trump administration demanded it be removed. Officials denied the report, including Katie Miller, the spokeswoman for Vice President Pence, who called it 'complete fiction.' There have been complaints for weeks that President Donald Trump has been trying to downplay how severe the outbreak is, leading to mixed messaging from the administration. In spite of the contradictions, Dr Fauci says he hopes the coronavirus outbreak disappears similarly to how SARS did in 2003. However, because coronavirus could be a seasonal disease, he said a vaccine is vital - but is more than a year away from being able to be distributed. Worldwide, more than 111,000 people have been infected and nearly 3,900 people have died. In the US, there are more than 600 cases in 34 states and 22 people - in California, Florida and Washington - have died."
8,Oil firms are the biggest losers in the stock market slump as production war between Saudi Arabia and Russia sends crude prices tumbling,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-8092429/Oil-majors-biggest-losers-stock-market-slump.html,"Oil stocks were the biggest losers on the Footsie today after an an oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia broke out at the weekend, sending crude prices tumble by over 30 per cent. FTSE 100 heavyweight BP fell as much as 23 per cent to close 19 per cent lower, while Shell ended the day 18 per cent down. FTSE 250-listed Premier Oil and Tullow were down 57 per cent and 31 per cent respectively at the close on Monday. It comes as Russia refused to agree to production cuts which would have served to prop up oil prices in the wake of falling demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. That led to a strong response from Saudi Arabia, which said it would not bear the brunt of the cuts and increased its own oil production, hence pushing prices lower. Oil prices crashed more than 30 per cent to just $31 per barrel overnight, down from $45 on Friday night, in their biggest one day decline since the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991. They have since regained some losses, but were still down 18 per cent at $36.86 on Monday afternoon. The fall in the price of oil sent markets around the world tumble, with the FTSE 100 losing as much as 8.5 per cent at the open. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said the sharp fall in oil prices called into question the sustainability of BP and Shell's dividends, which are both in excess of 10 per cent. 'While this seems quite attractive it also needs to be set in the context of share price declines year to date of over 35 per cent for Royal Dutch Shell and over 30 per cent for BP,' he said. 'BP's problems are particularly acute given their acquisition of BHP Billiton's shale assets a couple of years ago, for $10billion. 'With a gearing of over 30 per cent and a breakeven price of just below $50 a sustained period of lower oil prices is going to be painful and could well mean that shareholders might have to absorb a dividend cut.' Analysts believe that Russia and Saudi Arabia can cope with lower oil prices for a while, but those who will bear the brunt of the slump are US shale producers - and oil giants like BP and Shell. 'The ones who won't be able to take a prolonged period of low prices are US shale producers, and actually, most of the oil majors,' said City Index's analyst Matt Weller. 'Investors have already cottoned on to that, selling off BP and Shell this morning to the tune of almost 20%. Chevron and Exxon will also be in the firing line.' 'But the weakest links are US shale producers because they require oil prices of between $45 and $54 a barrel to break even.' Shares in US oil giants Chevron andExxon were also down, by 12 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Russ Mould at AJ Bell said Saudi Arabia's decision to enter a price war may not necessarily help it grab market share from US shale producers. 'A previous attempt between 2014 and 2016 to grab market share by pushing US shale oil producers out of business was ultimately a failure. The weakest operators in North America were wheedled out and the rest improved the efficiency of their operations and refined their technology. 'Time will tell if it plays out differently in 2020 but, unless there is a rapid recovery, the collapse in crude is likely to put significant strain on state finances in both Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as other countries which are major producers of oil. 'Conversely a falling oil price may provide some respite to consumers of oil amid the coronavirus disruption as it feeds through into lower costs for transport and energy.' "
9,Alarming photos show coronavirus patients hooked up to life support machines inside Italian quarantine-zone hospital as medics in hazmat suits fight to save their lives,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8090779/Italian-PM-makes-impassioned-plea-16-million-obey-quarantine.html,"Alarming new pictures show coronavirus patients being treated in intensive care at a hospital in northern Italy, where 16million people are facing quarantine in a drastic new lockdown. The photos show patients surrounded by wires and tubes being treated by medics in full protective suits with gloves, goggles and face masks at the hospital in Cremona. Some patients are lying face-down on their hospital beds, which researchers believe can raise survival rates in intensive care by improving oxygen levels in the blood. The hospital is in Lombardy which is one of the regions sealed off in the toughest quarantine measures that any country has imposed outside China. Italy's prime minister last night pleaded with his citizens to obey the draconian new measures, declaring that 'this is the time to be responsible' after the quarantine took effect in cities including Milan and Venice. 'We want to protect the health of all citizens, we are aware that this will create unease and that these measures will be a sacrifice, big and small,' Giuseppe Conte said in an address last night. 'But this is the time to be responsible. We all must respect and not dodge these measures. 'We should not counter these measures or dodge them, we must think about protecting our health, the health of our beloved ones, the health of our parents, but mainly the health of our grandparents,' he said, warning that older people have proved the most vulnerable to the virus. Italian police were today setting up checkpoints in Lombardy after the wealthy northern region and 14 other provinces were placed into lockdown in a measure which will last until at least April 3. Only people with a 'serious' reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, will be allowed in or out of the 'orange zones'. Anyone who breaks the rules without justification could face three months in prison or a 200-euro fine in a draconian new effort to tackle the crisis. The crisis deepened even further yesterday as Italy's death toll soared from 133 to 366, becoming the highest in the world outside China. The number of confirmed cases in the country also surged by 1,492 to 7,375, making the scale of the Italian outbreak worse than South Korea's. To make matters worse, six people died yesterday in one of several jailhouse riots after prisoners revolted over new rules which banned them from seeing their families over coronavirus fears. Airlines including British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet are still flying passengers to and from coronavirus-ridden regions of northern Italy after swathes of the country were put on lockdown. Return flights to Milan - one of the cities under lockdown - are still being offered by Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways and are all available to book online. Britons returning home from the worst-hit regions are not being checked for the virus upon landing in the UK. The Foreign Office confirmed that nationals returning from northern Italy - the worse-affected region - will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug. British Airways are 'reviewing their schedule' and have offered customers travelling from the quarantined zone full refunds. Customers who booked with BA - which has already scrapped hundreds of long-haul flights due to the killer bug - before April 2 have the option to change theirbooking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead. Meanwhile EasyJet will cancel some flights to and from the region up until April 3 - when the lockdown affecting 16 million people and covering much of the north - including Milan will end. The Foreign Office advises 14 days of self isolation once back in Britain - but there is nothing stopping people from using public transport or entering crowded places on their way home. People evacuated from Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - were quarantined for 14 days in an isolation compound. A BA spokesperson said: 'Following the change to the UK Government travel advice for Northern Italy, we are reviewing our schedule, and have contacted all customers who are due to travel today. 'We are also offering customers booked to fly before April 2, the option to change their booking up to another date up to the end of May, or to fly via Zurich or Geneva instead.' An EasyJet spokesperson said: 'We will provide a further update on our schedule in due course.' Weddings and funerals have been banned under the tough new health measures while museums, cinemas, shopping centres and restaurants have all been hit by new restrictions. Bars and restaurants can remain open as long as customers stay three feet apart - but will be shut down if their guests are found to be getting too close to each other. Schools have already been shut down across the country until March 15, with schools and universities in Lombardy and the 'orange zone' areas due to remain closed until at least April 3. The Pope, who has been ill in recent weeks, held his Sunday blessing by video instead of in person and described feeling like he was 'in a cage'. Italian police will be setting up controls at train stations to check people's temperatures, and stopping all cars on main roads in and out to verify the reason for travel, officials said. Cruise ships will be forbidden from docking in Venice, with only passengers who are residents of the lagoon city allowed to disembark. Alitalia suspended national and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport, and announced it was operating only domestic routes from Milan Linate. The borders with Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia remain open. Speaking to La Repubblica, prime minister Conte also vowed a course of 'massive shock therapy' to aid the Italian economy after much of its industrial and business heartland was shut down. The Milan stock market, which was already down some 17 per cent since the outbreak in northern Italy, plunged at Monday's opening, with the blue chip FTMIB index down 11 per cent. Matching similar calls from France, Conte said strict European Union borrowing limits should be loosened to allow more room for manoeuvre, and that the flexibility envisaged by the EU's budget rules should be used 'in full'. 'Europe cannot think of confronting an extraordinary situation with ordinary measures,' he said. The European Commission told Italy on Saturday that its planned extra spending in response to the outbreak would not be counted in measuring its compliance with EU budget rules. 'The economic measures in the works will be vigorous, commensurate to current needs, but temporary,' the economy ministry said, adding that Italy remained committed to reducing its debt as soon as possible. The ministry also said it would 'spare no effort' in ensuring that measures were agreed at a European level. While a quarter ofItaly's population faces life in quarantine, Britons in the coronavirus-ridden zone are free to travel home without restrictions. British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet still have Milan flights available to book on their website. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that British tourists in the northern parts of the country 'are free to return home or complete their holiday' under guidelines from the Italian government. They said UK nationals will not be met by anyone at the airport in Britain, nor will they be put into quarantine or told to take a test for the bug which has so killed more than 3,600 worldwide and has infected more than 100,000. The FCO updated its advice on Sunday night, advising against all but essential travel to a wider area of northern Italy due to the crisis. The move has been made following consultations with Italian authorities and the chief medical officer, the department said. Public Health England says all cabin crew are briefed on coronavirus symptoms and what to do if someone reports feeling ill onboard a flight. The captain is to call ahead to warn of any illness and a risk assessment will be carried out before passengers are let off the plane. It is possible to transmit the virus without any symptoms. A 'bespoke poster for Italy' will be given to travellers from Italy to inform them of what areas are affected. Information on symptoms and actions are provided to passengers. This protocol has been in place for northern Italy since March 4 and will be rolled out for the whole of Italy by March 11. Heathrow Airport says it has 'enhanced thorough cleaning processes and increased the amount of hand sanitisers for staff. Vincenzo Tosetti, a 34-year old actor and Venice resident, said that 'many people I know have fled, mainly from Milan. 'This is going to test the Italians' ability to behave responsibly, and I have to say that up until now they've been failing. There's been an exodus'. Fellow Venetian Giancarlo, 49, who did not want to give his last name, said 'you can feel the anxiety in the air'. The floating city was also virtually empty of tourists, which was 'a big blow'. 'First the city was hit by record floods [last autumn], now this. Venice is very fragile right now,' he said. The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions, and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy's less well medically equipped south. The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown - which include the cities of Parma and Rimini - to 'stop and turn around'. 'Get off (the train) at the first station, don't get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don't bring the epidemic to Puglia,' he said on Facebook. 'You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,' he said. Meanwhile, six prisoners have died after a series of jailhouse riots across Italywhich were sparked by tough new measures to stop the spread of the virus. Inmates set their prison on fire in Modena yesterday in an angry protest over a ban on family visits, unions said. Six inmates are confirmed to have died, including three who had been transferred to different prisons as authorities tried to quell the uprising. Justice ministry sources said two of the deaths in Modena were caused by an overdose from drugs found in the jail infirmaries, while a third prisoner was found blue in the face and their cause of death was still unclear. Police were today clashing with relatives who had gathered outside the jail, in northern Italy which is at the centre of the virus outbreak. The riot was one of several around the country with other disturbances taking place in Salerno, Naples and Milan among others. According to Il Corriere, a group of 60 inmates set fire to the prison in Modena after the tough new measures were announced. Footage broadcast by local media showed police and fire trucks outside the prison as black smoke swirled into the sky. Around 500 people were at risk of escaping until authorities laid siege to the penitentiary and eventually stormed the building. Once inside, they discovered a 'surreal scene and a devastated building', reports say, seizing a supply of drugs. The head of Italy's prison service, Francesco Basentini, said three inmates had at the jail and three others had died after being transferred to other prisons. 'There have been a series of rebellions across the country,' Basentini said in a televised interview. Prison officers' union Sappe said some 80 prisoners had been transferred to other jails after the uprising. 'The inmates that have been moved were those who managed to reach the yard in a bid to escape,' Seppe's secretary general Giovanni Battista Durante said. 'We are told other prisoners inside the jail have barricaded themselves in and probably have illegal weapons'. He said colleagues from the prison had told him the jail had been 'completely destroyed'. News of the impending quarantine was leaked to Italian media early, prompting further chaos as people rushed to get out of the affected areas. The leak infuriated Conte, who slammed it as 'unacceptable', saying it had created 'uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion'. Pina Antinucci, a psychoanalyst in her 60s who lives in Milan, told AFP she was suffering nightmares and felt the state was 'bombarding us with anxieties, spreading paranoia'. 'I'd like to know if I'm infected... it would be better to know if I have that unwanted guest who occupies our homes, minds and lives,' she said. Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who identified the Italian strain last month, said the leak had been a 'disastrous communication error' and 'absolute idiocracy'. Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak on Twitter as 'pure madness'. 'The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,' he said on social media. AirlineAlitalia said it was suspending national and international flights to and from Milan's Malpensa airport from March 9 after the government ordered a lockdown of large areas of northern Italy. In a statement, the Italian flag carrier said it would operate only national flights from the smaller Milan Linate airport, and reduce the number of flights between Venice and Rome. International routes will be served from Rome's Fiumicino airport. The new regime will continue until at least April 3, the airline said. Meanwhile, Pope Francis broke with centuries of tradition by enlisting the help of technology for his weekly Angelus prayer. 'I am close through prayer with the people who suffer from the current coronavirus epidemic,' the 83-year-old pontiff said in a message recorded at the Vatican library and aired live on a screen on Saint Peter's Square. The Pope himself tested negative for the contagion after he fell ill on Ash Wednesday with symptoms of a cold including a cough, fever, chills and sore throat. Italian football was also plunged into chaos as Serie A match between Parma and SPAL faced a last-minute delay following a call from Italy's sports minister to suspend the league during the outbreak. Players faced a75-minute wait for kick-off inside an empty stadium as officials considered an appeal from sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora minutes before the scheduled start. Spadafora said he supported a call from Italian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi to avoid putting players at risk amid the virus outbreak. Some had voiced growing anger over the idea of having to play matches during the coronavirus outbreak. 'It doesn't make sense right now, when we're requesting enormous sacrifices of our citizens in order to stop the spread of contagion, to put at risk the health of the players, referees, coaches and fans,' Spadafora said. The Italian league replied that it was following government orders to hold games in empty stadiums. 'The repeated and contrasting government statements only add to the general state of confusion and definitely don't help the system overcome the difficult time caused by the virus,' a league statement said. Five Serie A matches took place Sunday, beginning with Parma v Spal at lunchtime and concluding with Juventus v Inter Milan in the evening. All of the matches had already been postponed from last weekend. An appeal by Spadafora for this weekend's games to be shown on free TV 'considering the serious inconvenience affecting the population in this difficult time' was rejected by the league. 'The minister has gone from asking for the games to be shown for free to suspending the league, amid a decree to play behind closed doors,' Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini said. 'Italy needs clarity and gravitas right now, not populist proclamations.'"
10,Missouri school is closed after the father of the State's first coronavirus patient broke self quarantine so he could attend a dance with his other daughter and her classmatesÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8090759/Missouri-school-closed-father-States-coronavirus-patient-broke-self-quarantine.html,"The father of a Missouri woman who tested positive forcoronavirusviolated self-quarantine rules to attend a school dance with his younger daughter. The family, from St Louis, were asked to self-isolate by health officials after the woman, in her 20s, called the county's health hotline to report a high fever and cough. She arrived back in the U.S. at Chicago's O'Haire Airport on March 3 after a study trip to Italy. A day later, she took a home to St Louis after spending a night at a friend's place, prompting Amtrak to shut down that line. Amtrak has since started notifying other passengers who were on Amtrak train 303 at the time, and said it was out of service as it disinfects and cleans both the trains and the stations at Chicago and St Louis. The woman was tested for COVID-19 on March 6, and the results came back positive the next day. It comes as the number of positive coronavirus cases in the U.S. climbed to more than 600, and the death toll climbed to 22. The St Louis woman is believed to be the first person in the region to test positive for the virus. Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions. In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: Avoid people with these symtpoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possivle exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus.  Despite the instruction to self-isolate, the patient's father attended a father-daughter dinner dance hosted by the Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School at the Ritz-Carlton in Clayton with his younger child on Saturday. The school has since informed parents of its decision to close today in order to 'gather information and guidance from health officials'. In a letter to parents, school officials said the father and daughter didn't learn about the diagnosis until they were already at the dance, which was scheduled to begin at 6.30pm. The family members immediately left once notified. In a statement on Sunday, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said the coronavirus patient's father 'did not act consistently with thehealth department's instructions and instead ... he decided to take his daughter to a school function.' He added that thecounty health department sent the family a letter on Sunday informing them they must follow its guidelines, St Louis Public Radioreported. The quarantine, which applies to all members of the family, is expected to last 14 days after the patient has stopped showing any symptoms of COVID-19. Page added: 'The way the family has reacted to this situation is really a tale of two reactions and a study of how people should and should not react to the coronavirus. 'The patient had conducted herself responsibly and maturely, and she is to be commended for complying with the health departmentâ€™s instructions.' Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School is urging students and parents who attended the dance on Saturday to seek medical treatment and to notify the school if they begin to display any symptoms of the virus. Villa Duchesne, an independent Catholic school, also notified parents on Sunday that a decision had been made to 'cancel classes and any activities' on Monday so they can 'gather information and guidance from health officials.' In a statement, the school said: 'The health and safety of our students, staff and their families will always be our top priority. 'With that in mind, we have made the decision to cancel classes and any activities at Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill School tomorrow â€“ March 9. We will use the day to gather information and guidance from health officials. 'We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this situation. We are taking this important step out of an abundance of caution. 'We will communicate more information to all of our families via email as early as possible on Monday.' It added it was 'communicating with the St. Louis County Department of Public Health' after learning that a woman 'who has received a positive test for COVID-19 is the older sister of aVilla Duchesne student.' Alice Dickherber, Director of Communications and Marketing, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:'We are communicating with the St. Louis County Department of Public Health and sharing everything that we know with them. 'We will work with officials to ensure we are doing everything possible to mitigate risk and to maintain our safe environment. 'We are committed to the health and safety of our community and we will follow the guidance of public health officials as we plan for the coming days.' The coronavirus patient, a woman in her 20s, is said to have returned from Italy and landed atChicago O'Hare International Airport on Monday, Fox News reported. She then stayed with a friend in the area before travelling to St Louis byAmtrak. A spokesman for Page added: 'Amtrak is notifying passengers and employees who may have been on the same train, and as a precaution, we have taken the train out of service for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection, and are also working to do a thorough disinfection of the Chicago and St. Louis stations.'"
11,Donald Trump's top economic advisers will present him with crisis plan for the economy - but only AFTER he has flown around Florida to rake in cash for his re-election,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8092037/Donald-Trumps-economic-advisers-present-crisis-plan-economy.html,"Top economic advisors are planning to present economic options to President Donald Trump for how to steady financial markets and short up the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak when he gets back to Washington from a campaign fundraiser. Trump, who attended a fundraiser Friday night at his Mar-a-Lago property and visited his golf course over the weekend, is set to return to Washington Monday afternoon. First he had a fundraiser in a gated community in Orlando. At the top of the list of economic proposals is paid sick leave. The virus outbreak, now being called a pandemic, has exposed how sick workers can put others at risk when they show up at the office to avoid losing pay. Uber and Lyft are taking steps to make sure their workers get paid if sidelined due to the coronavirus. CNBC reported other ideas for economic stimulus would be included, with a full men of options. Officials have also been discussing ways to provide additional help on an emergency basis for small business owners. An $8.3 billion new coronavirus law the president signed Friday contains funds to help small businesses. Trump's Orlando funder was at the home of Bob Dello Russo, 69, and Dianne Russo. Guests paid up to $100,000 per couple for a roundtable, photo and reception. The event was expected to bank up to $3 million for Trump's reelection effort. Dello Russo runs an HVAC company. The home where Trump made his pitch for campaign cash inside a large tent measures 27,000 square feet and is located inside a gated community. It is fronted by two large palm trees and features a tall stone fountain surrounded by carved life-sized geese. Pool reporters traveling with the president were prevented from taking a gander at happenings inside. Press members were held in a large garage attached to a rec room with a golf simulator. Staff prohibited them from taking pictures of the location where they were being held. Trump flew back to Washington on Air Force One accompanied by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who was criticized for wearing a large gas mask on the floor of the House when voting on an $8.3 billion spending bill responding to the health emergency. The Trump administration elected not to bring out prominent financial advisor as financial markets tanked Monday morning amid coronavirus fears and moves in the oil markets. Trump himself, who has trumpeted stock market gains throughout his tenure, didn't respond to questions about the dive as he flew from West Palm Beach to Orlando for a campaign fundraising event. Nor did the administration send out top economic advisor Larry Kudlow, who on Friday spoke to four financial markets amid concerns about the coronavirus. 'Long-term investors should think seriously about buying these dips,' Kudlow told CNBC Friday morning. Kudlow, whoheads the National Economic Council, also encouraged people to buy the dip in the down market in a Feb. 25th interview with the Washington Post. Kudlow told the Fox Business Network Friday: 'Long term investors should think about going back into the stock market because thereâ€™s a lot cheaper price.' Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters the markets have 'obviously been very active today.' 'The fundamentals in this economy are unbelievable,' the former drug company exec said. He said Trump was leading a 'whole of government response,' adding, 'that is his number one concern.' He refused to take questions, pointing to a Mike Pence coronavirus briefing set for 5:30 pm. 'I'll see you all later today I'm sure,' Azar said. Trump claimed that the market trends are 'good' for consumers as the U.S. Dow drops 7 per cent when markets opened Monday morning. 'Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!' Trump tweeted Monday. 'Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil,' Trump continued in another tweet Monday morning. 'That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!' White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared on Fox News Monday morning, where she accused politicians and the media of politicizing the disease outbreak. 'You know, I've said this before and the president's said this before as well. I just want to stress to politicians and the media to stop using this as a tool to politicize things and to scare people. It's not responsible. This is not the time for this,' she said. 'People need to be looking to the [Centers for Disease Control] for guidance. People need to be, again, washing their hands, treating this like a flu, making responsible choices. This is absolutely not the time to be trying to scare people to gain political points or to get headlines,' she said. Trump visited the CDC Friday, where he spoke about the virus and wove in statements about impeachment and his phone call to the president of Ukraine while wearing a 'Make America Great' baseball hat.

12,"PIERS MORGAN: Stop playing down the deadly threat of coronavirus, Mr President, and start telling Americans the truth - or it may cost you your presidency",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8092251/PIERS-MORGAN-Stop-playing-coronavirus-Mr-President-start-telling-Americans-truth.html,"'Face reality as it is, not as it was, or as you would wish it to be,' said the late, great business tycoon Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric into one of the world's most successful firms. Welch sadly died last week, and his long-time friend Donald Trump paid fulsome tribute to him: 'There was no corporate leader like 'Neutron Jack', he tweeted. 'He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together.' Today, the President needs to heed his wise friend's advice. Fast. The coronavirus crisis engulfing the entire planet at breakneck speed is a very serious threat to human life, and nobody, not even the finest scientific brains, are quite sure how bad things will get. That's why we're seeing worst hit countries like China and Italy desperately locking down entire cities to try to get on top of it, oil prices collapsing, and stock markets crashing to levels not seen since 9/11 and the global financial meltdown of 2008/2009. In such moments of catastrophe, world leaders are made or broken. Decisions they make either cement or destroy their future legacies. This especially applies to US presidents. George W. Bush, for one, will be forever stained by his appallingly tone-deaf response to Hurricane Katrina. And Jimmy Carter was voted out of office for failing to rescue American hostages in Iran. Conversely, John F Kennedy remains revered for staring down the Soviet Union during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. And Harry S. Truman is hugely admired for his decisive leadership to end World War 2. Yet President Trump seems hell-bent on pursuing a very self-destructive course when it comes to handling the biggest test of his presidency, and it's one that could see him get kicked out of the White House in November if he doesn't stop it. As with Carter's one-term demise, it won't be because Americans blame him for causing the crisis, but because they ultimately blame him for the way he dealt with it. And right now, he is dealing with it very badly. The most important thing for any president to do when a crisis like this begins to kill Americans is to impart accurate information to the public that matches up to whatever the country's chief medical experts are saying. And to remain calm, focused and avoid any hyperbolic rhetoric, good or bad, that might cause unnecessary public panic. President Trump has done none of these things. Instead, he's spent the past two weeks dismissing coronavirus as a nothing-burger, insisting the US has it completely under control, contradicting expert advice, and telling us all why he's a medical genius whose 'hunch' is that there's nothing to worry about. Well sorry, Mr President, but this isn't a time for your hunches or demonstrably false statements. This is a time for cold, hard, medical facts and scientific evidence. On Friday, Trump stated that 'anyone who wants a test can have a test'. Yet his own Vice-President Mike Pence, who is overseeing the White House coronavirus response, admitted just hours earlier: 'We don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate the demand going forward.' 'Things change in a crisis, the advice may change in a crisis,' Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told the New York Times. 'And so it's really important for the public to have confidence in the messages and the messengers so that they understand and believe new information and advice.' How are Americans supposed to have any confidence when the President says one thing and his deputy says another? The need for speedy testing is absolutely essential in fighting coronavirus, as it can focus attention on where it's needed. Yet the Times also reported the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched its first effort at a diagnostic test kit, causing a significant delay, and then severely limited supply by imposing very narrow criteria. As a result, when the first American cases began to appear, very few people were able to be tested. Indeed, the first US resident to contract the virus through community contact, in California, didn't get tested for four days after entering hospital even though doctors had requested a test. As of this weekend, only 5,860 public samples had actually been tested, which is a staggeringly, shamefully low number for a superpower of 325 million people that's had three months to prepare since news of COV-19 emerged. By contrast, China has tested millions and South Korea is testing 10,000 people a day. Now the fear is that the coronavirus genie is out of the bottle in the U.S. and has been silently sweeping through communities in victims showing no symptoms, or through those who do but can't get tested, ready to erupt as it has in Italy these past few days to devastating effect. And if that is the case then all the subsequent testing can do is offer a clearer idea of infection rates rather than enable officials to stop the outbreak in its tracks. President Trump seems either in deliberate denial about this, or genuinely oblivious to the reality of what is happening. As other countries race to shut down sports events, movie theaters, restaurants, public transport and other places where large gatherings amass, America continues to hide its head in the sand, hoping this will all blow over. It won't. It's going to get a lot worse, very quickly. This morning, Trump went on an angry defensive self-congratulatory tweet-storm, boasting about how well he is handling the crisis, and attacking 'fake news media and their partner the Democrat Party' for 'doing everything within its semi-considerable power to inflame the Coronavirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant.' He then quoted Surgeon General as saying, 'The risk is low to the average American.' That last claim is probably true. For most people under 50, in good health, it appears to be a relatively low risk virus. But the risk for elderly and infirm people is extremely high, and the speed of infection of COD-19 - way faster than normal flu - and deadly severity of its impact on people in those group- far worse than normal flu - are genuinely scary. In Italy alone, it has now infected almost as many people as SARS infected worldwide in its entirety, infections are rocketing higher every day, and the mortality rate is running at nearly 5 percent. If the same thing happens in the U.S. then hundreds of thousands of Americans will die. This eventuality would make Trump's 'there's nothing to worry about' rebound savagely and perhaps unforgivably in his political face. (Ironically, Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China â€“ which is what Trump boasts of doing in America to great effect â€“ and yet it's suffered the worst outbreak in Europe.) It doesn't take even a stable genius to work out why Trump is maintaining this 'nothing to see here' stance. If coronavirus runs riot through America, and the economy, his biggest success story, continues to implode, then the President knows he could face the vengeful wrath of voters at the ballot box. Even his die-hard base may drop their unwavering support if their relatives start dying and their business go bust. So, the stakes are potentially very high for President Trump. That's why he was even reluctant to let Americans off a cruise ship in San Francisco into quarantine, despite the risk to their health aboard a vessel with 21 confirmed cases of the virus - because he said he didn't want the number of reported US infections to rise. Seriously, Mr President? These people are not just 'numbers' â€“ they're American citizens who have an absolute right to be back on U.S. soil. To be perfectly frank, I don't care right now about what coronavirus means for Trump politically. I care about coronavirus means for public health. And the President's normal swaggering, loose-tongued, fact-challenged, wise-cracking style of leadership just doesn't work on something as serious as this. On Friday, during his weird and woeful press conference, he boasted about having a 'supergenius' scientist uncle at MIT, and then said: 'I like this stuff, I really get it, people are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability?' No offence, Mr President, but everything you're been saying about COD-19 to date suggests you have absolutely no idea what the hell you're dealing with. As your friend Jack Welch said, face reality as it is, not what you want it to be. I strongly suggest you stop your absurdly premature victory tour, leave the expert talk to the experts and start taking coronavirus a lot more seriously, before it's too late - for Americans, and for your presidency.

13,Jack Dorsey will keep his job as Twitter CEO after company strikes $1bn investment deal with Elliott Management and Silver Lake following their campaign to oust himÂ ,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8091751/Twitter-deal-Silver-Lake-Elliott-Dorsey-CEO.html,"Twitter says it's reached an investment deal with Silver Lake and Elliott Management that will keep Jack Dorsey as CEO. The social media company announced the deal on Monday, giving Elliott a seat on the board just over a week after the activist hedge fund pushed for Dorsey's removal. Under the deal, private equity firm Silver Lake will invest $1billion in Twitter and also get a board seat. Twitter said it would use the investment and its own cash to fund a $2billion stock buyback. Elliott and its billionaire founder billionaire Paul Singer acquired a $1billion stake in Twitter on February 28 and launched a campaign to remove Dorsey after the CEO announced last fall that he would be moving to Africa in mid-2020. Among Singer's concerns about Dorsey was his divided attention between his roles at Twitter and Square, the payments company he co-founded. Investors also raised concerns over how Dorsey would run both companies if he was to move to Africa for half a year. Elliott, which owns about four percent of Twitter's stock, was planningto nominate four people to its eight-member board when three of the company's directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, sources told Reuters last month. The new deal with Silver Lake appears to have quashed the threat of Dorsey's removal. It does not specifically mention changes to his role. Twitter on Monday said its board has formed a committee to evaluate its leadership structure, CEO succession plan and share the results publicly before the end of the year. 'As a Board, we regularly review and evaluate how Twitter is run, and while our CEO structure is unique, so is Jack and so is this company,' said Patrick Pichette, lead independent director of Twitter's board. Silver co-CEO and managing partner Egon Durban and Elliott partner Jesse Cohn will join the board as Twitter continues to search for a third new independent director with expertise in technology and artificial intelligence, according to Pichette. According to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, Elliott and Silver will not 'comment on or influence, or attempt to influence, directly or indirectly, any Twitter policies or rules, or policy or rule enforcement decisions, related to the Twitter platform'. Shares of Twitter were down about six percent during premarket trading but surged following news of the deal. Twitter is one of the few US technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about two percent of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott. Dorsey is the only CEO to lead two public companies with market valuations greater than $5billion. The investment deal came just days after Dorsey said he is re-evaluating his decision to move to Africa in light of thecoronavirus threat and 'everything else going on'. Dorsey tweeted in November, as he was wrapping up a tour of the continent, that he was planning to move there for three to six months in mid-2020. 'Sad to be leaving the continentâ€¦for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I'll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020,' he wrote. He backtracked on the move while speaking ata Q&A session at Morgan Stanley's Tech, Media and Telecom Conference last Thursday, blamingthe global uncertainty about the spread of the coronavirus for his step back and claiming that he would still consider it in the future when he was able to give more context. 'When I tweeted about my intention to spend a few months in Africa this year, I made a mistake and should have provided more context about why,' said a comment from Dorsey via the Twitter Investor Relations account. 'Africa will be one of the most populated continents in the next 20-30 yrs, the tech innovation is incredible w/ a large portion of the population still coming onto the internet. Huge opportunity especially for young people to join Twitter + for us to learn to best serve them. 'I had been working on my plans where I'd work decentralized, as my team and I do when we travel, but in light of COVID-19 and everything else going on I need to reevaluate. Either way we'll continue to pursue opportunities in Africa.' Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 and left in 2013 to found Square following a series of corporate shake-ups and rumors of leadership turmoil. Since he returned to Twitter in 2015, the company's shares have turned by 6.2 percent. Investors have remained uncertain about the CEO and concerns reached a fever pitch late last month when Singer took a $1billion stake in Twitter. Singer, a Republican mega-donor, was reportedly planning to use his newfound influence to push for many changes, starting at the top by nominatingfour directors, including two people from his New York-based hedge fund. According to insiders cited by Bloomberg, Singer's main grievance was that Dorsey splits his time as CEO of Twitter and CEO as Square Inc, his mobile payments app from which he derives the majority of his reported $5billion fortune. Singer believes Dorsey's undivided attention should be devoted to Twitter, especially given the looming 2020 election and other global news events which the company has a role in spreading information about. He is also a staunch Trump supporter. While his views on Dorsey's politics are not known, many Republican pundits or activists have criticized the Twitter CEO for banning political ads or even banning them when they share conservative content on the site. After Singer's announcement Twitter shares jumped by seven percent to $35.75 on March 3, three percent more than they had all year. It boosted the company's overall value by $1billion to slightly over $28billion. But while the market responded keenly to the news, Twitter employees revolted against it. They started tweeting their support of Dorsey with the hashtag '#WeBackJack' and even Elon Musk, the eccentric founder of Tesla whose own presence on Twitter has caused problems for his company, shared his support. 'Just want say that I support @jack as Twitter CEO. He has a good [heart],' Musk tweeted, using a red love heart emoji. Twitter executives met with Singer and his representatives in San Francisco on Friday night but Dorsey was not present for the meeting. Dorsey's claim that he was reneging on the decision because of the coronavirus came as the tech company took precautions to prevent the spread among its employees. Last week,Twitter said it was 'strongly encouraging' its staff in the US and across the world to work from home as the death toll began to reach over 100. The San Francisco-based social media giant urged its 5,000 staffers to stay away from its various offices where possible in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. There is a mandatory ban on Twitter employees coming into offices in South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. 'We are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they're able. Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus for us - and the world around us,' Twitter HR chief Jennifer Christie wrote in a blog post on Monday. 'We are operating out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy. 'We are working to make sure internal meetings, all hands, and other important tasks are optimized for remote participation. We recognize that working from home is not ideal for some job functions. For those employees who prefer or need to come into the offices, they will remain open for business.' Twitter had already announced the suspension of 'non-critical' business travel and events last week. Dorsey also said the company would no longer be appearing at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas later this month as a result of the coronavirus."
14,Harvey Weinstein 'is being treated for concussion after falling and hitting his head' at Rikers prison where he is 'living in a dorm-style cell with two other inmates',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8090817/Harvey-Weinstein-treated-concussion-falling-hitting-head-Rikers-prison.html,"Harvey Weinstein is being treated for concussion after falling and hitting his head in prison, it has been reported. The disgraced film producer is caged in adorm-style cell in New York's notorious Rikers Island prison with two other inmates, a source claimed yesterday. Weinstein - who is said to have been 'miserable' ever since arriving at the jail - has been treated for the fall. The 67-year-old will be sentenced for two sex crimes on Wednesday and is said to have been been 'humbled' by his incarceration for sex crimes. His spokesperson Juda Engelmayer told Page Six:'He's miserable but trying to be optimistic as best he can. He has had a lot of time to think about his life and be humbled, but he thinks it's going to be a long, uphill battle from here.' He added that adjusting to jail life has been especially difficult without the aid of his walker. On Saturday night, Weinstein fell over after trying to walk on his own. 'He fell on his head and thinks he has a concussion,' Engelmayer said. 'His head has been pounding since yesterday.' Details of his supposed prison set-up were disclosed following reports in the US that he was given his own wing at the prison, which is so grim it is being shut down by New York City in 2026. The disgraced movie mogul is housed in the North Infirmary Command with two 'older gentlemen,' his spokesperson added. An official at the city's Department of Corrections claimed that he was being kept isolated for fears other prisoners might attack him. The news website TMZ said he was given 24-hour security and medical care. A source close to the movie mogul said he had already had a fall that required medical attention. He had been accused of getting special treatment because after his conviction on February 24, instead of going straight to Rikers, he was taken to hospital, where he stayed for ten days. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital by ambulance immediately after being found guilty when he complained of chest pains. Weinstein had a four-hour operation to put a stent in his heart, but was deemed healthy enough to move last Friday. He was then taken from Bellevue in New York to Rikers Island. His legal team had hoped he would stay at the hospital until his sentencing. He is guilty of one count of a criminal sexual act and one count of third-degree rape and faces up to 29 years in jail. The victims were Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant, and Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress. Miss Haleyi is expected to read a victim impact statement at his sentencing. Until then, Weinstein is being kept on the sixth floor of the main building of the North Infirmary Command at Rikers â€“ a unit for high-profile prisoners and inmates with medical issues. The source said: 'Harvey and his prison consultant say it's not true that the floor is closed down for him. He has two roommates. It's dorm style. He has the same treatment as everybody else has. 'He said that this is a very humbling and reflective time for him. 'He is being very respectful and not the same arrogant man he once was. He's not in good condition physically, he has fallen down in the jail already, and he's doing his best to stay the course.' It was not clear what crimes Weinstein's roommates have been convicted of, although Rikers includes everyone from burglars to murderers. TMZ also reported that Weinstein was under 24-hour surveillance to stop him killing himself. Prison officials fear that he may do the same as billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who hanged himself in his cell while awaiting sex trafficking charges. Weinstein was said to be monitored by cameras and frequent checks by guards. Sources told TMZ he receives medical attention for back problems, eye issues and other ailments, including after-care for his recent surgery. The Department of Corrections said Weinstein gets one hour of recreation time every day and access to the law library and religious services. His meals include healthy options, but he can request junk food. Weinstein is known for loving his sweets, and cleaned out the court's canteen of his favourite brand during the trial. On Friday prosecutors filed a memo calling for Weinstein to receive a severe sentence to reflect a 40-year career of sexual misconduct. Joan Illuzzi, the lead prosecutor, said the list of incidents shows a 'lifetime of abuse toward others, sexual and otherwise'."
